{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年出現較慢增長，反映內地需求轉弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長將保持緩和，面對嚴峻的外部逆風及脆弱的金融市場情況。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港經濟在本年經濟增長放緩，實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長放慢至2.4%，較2014年的2.6%為低（見表1）。這反映內需擴張較為溫和，儘管淨出口重新成為GDP增長的正數貢獻者，因總進口下跌速度高於總出口（見圖1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞動市場大致穩定，失業率維持在低水平，約為3.3%。通脹進一步緩和，因國內成本及進口價格的上漲壓力減退。本地股市在面對全球金融市場高度波動的情況下出現大幅上落。在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始回軟，樓價在年底顯示進一步 consolidate 的跡象。\n\n圖 1 實際本地生產總值增長情況（按貢獻計算）  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n表 1 以支出組成別計算之實質 GDP 成長率（期間對期間）\n\n注意：經季節因素調整的季度對季度固定資本形成總額變動率資料不可得。\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年香港貨幣兌換率維持穩定，港元兌美元匯率維持在7.75附近。由於與股票相關的資金流入，強方兌換保證在4月被觸發，並在9月及10月再次被觸發，反映離岸人民幣轉換為港元以及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總體結餘增加，本地利率繼續維持低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率則在12月中美國利率上調後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩，由2014年的12.7%減至2015年的3.5%。銀行業整體貸款質素輕微惡化，但貸款分類比率仍然維持在低水平。\n\n# 國內需求\n\n國內需求在2015年的增長步伐較慢。雖然就業與收入情況大致穩定，繼續提供支持，但較弱的消費者信心以及資產價格的調整，拖累私人消費在下半年的增長。然而，由於上半年增長動力相對強勁，私人消費全年增長從2014年的3.3%提高至4.8%。政府消費則輕微加快，增長3.4%。事實上，國內需求較慢的增長主要是由於固定資本形成總額下跌2.2%（圖2）。私人部門機械與設備採購連續第二年出現下滑，企業信心惡化，同時建築與建設活動也顯示出較弱的增長動力，與公共工程進度放緩同步。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口表現於2015年轉差（圖3）。商品出口錄得廣泛下跌1.7%，為自2009年以來首次。出口至日本及歐洲聯盟下跌，而出口至美國則僅微增。這些先進市場的呆滯最終需求亦拖累地區工業活動及區域內貿易。結果，香港出口至內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣亦因這些經濟體較弱的中間及最終需求而下跌。香港服務業出口繼續從早年高增長路徑轉弱，並在2015年達到0.6%的下跌，主要由於入境旅遊放緩。商品進口亦因較弱的內需及出口引致需求而下跌。相對而言，服務業進口因本地居民旅遊興趣強勁而加快增長。以淨額計算，香港整體貿易順差在2015年略微改善，對本地生產總值增長作出溫和正數貢獻。\n\n圖2 國內需求\n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n2015年基本物價上漲壓力進一步減退，受到國內成本壓力放緩及進口價格上漲減緩的影響。扣除政府一次性纾困措施的影響後，基本物價上漲率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖4）。由於經濟活動欠佳，勞動成本壓力仍然穩定，而商業及工業租賃成本壓力則有所減退，尤其在上半年。由於全球商品價格回軟及港元強勢，進口價格壓力減退，食品物價上漲亦保持低水平。由於早前季度新訂住宅租賃的傳導效應輕微，物價上漲中的租賃成分仍然受到遏抑。\n\n圖3 商品及服務出口\n資料來源：統計處\n\n圖 4 基本消費者物價通脹  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n勞動市場情況在2015年仍然穩定。勞動需求維持不變，與零售及旅遊相關行業就業人數的下跌情況相比，其他行業招聘步伐穩定，因此總就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。同時，勞動供應亦上升1.3%，整年經季節因素調整後的失業率維持在約3.3%水平（圖5）。鑑於勞動市場仍然偏緊，全年首三個季度名義工資上升4.7%，較2014年的4.3%為高。隨著通脹壓力減輕，首三個季度實質工資上升1.3%，較2014年下跌0.1%為佳。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市因外部環境出現劇烈變化，而經歷了一個波動的年份。在首季表現平穩後，受內地A股市場樂觀情緒及資金流入影響，本地股市在第二季表現強勁。4月恆生指數急升至七年高位，南向每日額度在2014年11月啟用以來首次用盡（圖6）。然而，自6月下旬起，本地股市開始轉勢，受內地A股市場及全球股市沽售、全球外匯市場波動加劇及國際商品價格走弱影響，恆生指數在9月下跌28%，創下一年低位。在最後一個季度，隨著全球及內地金融市場回穩，香港股市有所回升。整體而言，2015年恆生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而平均每日成交額則由2014年的695億港元上升至1,115.6億港元。儘管第二季後資金集資活動放緩，但來自本地股市的整體股本融資額仍由一年前的942.7億港元增加至1,115.6億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整理跡象。在2015年初經歷了一段熱絡時期後，繼2月公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始回軟。在去年第四季房價上漲步伐放緩並隨後下跌的情況下，2015年整體房價累計上升2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%增幅（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期下降12.3%，至55,982宗，因第二季後半段二手市場交易活動明顯減少。投機性交易，包括確認交易及短線倒賣交易，持續維持在低水平。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力仍然吃緊，價格收入比率達到15.7，收入負擔比率遠高於長期平均值。商業及工業物業市場在上半年表現熱絡，但隨後交易活動放緩，去年第四季價格及租金均出現下跌。租金回報率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低點附近。\n\n圖

經濟環境\n\n香港2016年經濟增長預期將保持緩和。私人分析機構預期經濟將以較慢的平均增速1.7%擴張，而政府預期增長幅度為1至2%。具體而言，欠佳的全球增長展望、持續疲弱的入境旅遊以及動盪的全球金融市場情況所引發的負面溢出效應，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。本地方面，私人消費預期將適度增長，因勞動市場情況將面臨一些壓力，而在經濟動能較弱的情況下，本地資產價格調整可會削弱消費者信心，並引起負面財富效應。建築及建設活動或可維持，但較弱的企業信心及利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n\n通脹壓力預期在2016年將保持受到遏抑。進口價格壓力將維持緩和，而國內成本壓力則預期在經濟成長動能輕微的情況下表現為溫和。由於2015年底新訂住宅租金壓力有所減弱，通脹中的租金成分亦可能稍為減弱。市場共識預期2016年的 headline 通脹率為2.5%，而政府預期基礎通脹率為2.0%。同時，由於入境旅遊放緩及出口產業持續低迷，勞動市場亦可能稍為回軟。私人部門分析師現預期失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n2016年的經濟展望會面對一些不確定因素及風險。尤其值得注意的是，美國利率進一步上升的步調、全球經濟增長展望及商品價格走勢將繼續是主要的不確定因素。任何顯著的不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動，從而緊縮本地貨幣及金融情況，並對香港的經濟展望造成陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，很大程度上取決於它們透過財富及資產負債表效應對樓市的影響。雖然樓市正面對來自全球及本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及住宅需求與供應差距收窄的日益下行風險，但仍有更多時間去判斷樓市是否已進入下行周期。儘管樓市突然調整可能對整體經濟構成重大不利因素，但過去幾年所推行的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已顯著增強香港銀行體系的抗風險能力。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在本年仍然穩健，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策出現進一步分歧，以及新興市場經濟體的風險與不穩定因素不斷積累。獲認可機構（AIs）的流動性地位繼續保持良好，本地註冊的AIs資本充裕。零售銀行的資產質素輕微轉差，但仍然維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n配合美國利率，全年港元銀行間利率均保持低水平。零售銀行的港元資金成本在上半年出現下跌，反映綜合利率呈現下行趨勢，並在下半年保持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率（BLR）\n說明：\n1. HiBoR fixings 指由香港銀行協會發佈的港元利息結算率，為月度平均。\n\n2. BlR 指香港上海銀行有限公司所報的最優惠貸款利率（每月平均）。\n\n\n# 利潤走勢\n\n2015年銀行業的盈利能力放緩。零售銀行在香港的辦事處總體預稅營業利潤下跌2.8%，雖然費用及佣金收入（上升9.7%）、外匯及衍生工具業務收入（上升22.4%）及淨利息收入（上升1.3%）有所增長，但營運費用增加8.8%及貸款減值準備增加76%所造成的影響則抵銷了這些增長。然而，零售銀行的稅後利潤上升14.7%，主要由於戰略性投資的出售所產生的收益。零售銀行的稅後資產回報率由2014年的0.99%改善至1.05%（圖8）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

貨幣穩定\n\n香港貨幣兌換率在2015年整體大致穩定，儘管面對動盪的金融市場情況及12月美國利率上調。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。作為香港過去數十年貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度繼續對外來衝擊表現穩健。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目的是維持貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率於本港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元的區間內保持穩定。貨幣制度的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有百分之百由存於發行基金的美元儲備所支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須百分之百配合美元儲備的相應變動。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括\n\n* 由三家發行銀行發行的提供十足支持的負債證明書  \n* 政府發行的流通金額  \n* 清算帳戶結餘總體，即銀行存於香港金融管理局的清算帳戶結餘總額  \n* 香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發行基金票據及紙幣\n\n香港貨幣兌換率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局堅決履行兌換保證（CUs）的承諾而維持。當對港元的需求大於供應，且市場兌換率升至每美元7.75港元的強方兌換保證時，香港金融管理局會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總體結餘將隨之擴大，推低港元利率，創造貨幣情況，使港元由強方上限回復至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供應大於需求，且市場兌換率跌至每美元7.85港元的弱方兌換保證時，香港金融管理局會從銀行買入港元。總體結餘將隨之收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元由弱方上限回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n所載之負債證明書及現行流通金額之政府發行紙幣及硬幣，均以港元面值計。本年度報告中交換基金資產負債表所載相應項目，其金額以港元計，等值於該項目在資產負債表日期之現行匯率下，用以贖回所需之美元數額。此安排根據香港普遍接受之會計原則。\n\nherein 所顯示的 EFBN 金額與本年度報告中交易所基金的資產負債表所載的 EFBN 金額有所不同。根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表交易所基金就其在二手市場交易 EFBN 所持有的 EFBN，會根據有關交易所發行的 EFBN 進行抵銷，並於資產負債表中錄得淨金額。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定\n\n香港貨幣兌美元匯率在2015年整體大致穩定，於7.7500至7.7657之間波動（圖1）。年初時，香港貨幣兌美元略為轉弱，市場對美國利率上調的憂慮有所影響。然而，第二季香港貨幣兌美元匯率轉強，接近7.75，主要由於4月時，因股市活動興旺，與股票相關的香港貨幣需求急升，導致強方兌換保證（CU）多次被觸發。踏入年下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著沽售，以及全球貨幣市場波動增加（包括人民幣），香港貨幣兌美元匯率仍持續接近7.75。受離岸人民幣轉換為香港貨幣的影響，9月及10月強方兌換保證再次被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25個基點，但香港貨幣兌美元匯率仍維持在緊密範圍內，沒有顯著的資金流出壓力。整體而言，2015年香港貨幣兌美元匯市在動盪的全球金融市場情況下，仍然有序運作。\n\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證的強方方面在4月、9月及10月多次被觸發，香港金融管理局根據貨幣發行局原則，被動地購入總值293億美元的外幣，以換取2,272億港元，這導致總體結餘出現相應擴大，其中部分擴大被增發的票據所抵銷，以回應銀行對流動性管理的強烈需求（圖2）。增發票據的行為符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這顯示了貨幣基礎組成的變化，而貨幣基礎則全面由外匯儲備支持。總體結餘及發出的貨幣發行基金票據及紙幣總額，由年初的9,925億港元增至2015年底的1,2210億港元。\n\n圖2 2015年總體結餘及未償發票基金紙幣\n\n# 財務市場\n\n銀行體系內流動性充裕，2015年香港美元銀行同業拆息利率整體仍然偏低。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）由0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%，根據既定公式，香港銀行同業拆息利率亦於12月17日上調至0.75%。2015年整體而言，由隔夜至三個月期的銀行同業拆息利率均低於基本利率（圖3），其波動主要由銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場波動情況下流動性收緊所帶動。大致跟隨香港銀行同業拆息利率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息利率（LIBOR）之間的差距，香港美元期貨點數於8月因市場流動性收緊而出現顯著溢價，其後因美國美元利率出現廣泛上調，年底時則回落至折讓（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗口借款活動不活躍，2015年僅有HK$28億。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖3 2015年香港美元銀行間利率\n\n圖 4 2015年港元期貨點數\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯匯制度（LERS）一直暢順運作，並在過去數十年間顯著促進香港的貨幣及金融穩定。鑑於香港經濟規模小而開放，且擔任國際金融中心的角色，聯匯制度仍然是香港最合適的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅決承諾維持聯匯制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的公信力，市民繼續對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存工具保持強烈信心。在2015年對香港的第四條審查中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續支持聯匯制度為香港最優的貨幣安排，並指出香港強健的體制、法律及政策框架、充裕的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及良好的金融體系為支持聯匯制度暢順運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於一個強健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測驗結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管工作，以優化銀行業的抗風險能力。考慮到美國利率的上升，香港金融管理局提醒公眾應作出必要準備以管理風險，指出任何觸發弱方兌換保證及港元流出的情況，都是港元利率正常化的自然及必要步驟。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的發行基金資產分配用以支持貨幣基礎。自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的發行基金資產分配用以支持貨幣基礎。後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）於2015年維持在窄幅範圍106.3至107.5%之間，並未觸及上或下觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收市為106.3%（圖5）。根據聯匯制度，雖然已指定特定發行基金資產用以支持後備組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財政資源可提供強力後盾，以保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定，以防備突然的衝擊。\n\n圖5 2015年每日支持比率的變動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣發行局小組委員會監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的問題。2015年，該小組委員會考慮的問題包括全球銀行提供國際美元貸款的供應情況、國際上宏觀審慎措施的使用情況、美國利率上升對香港樓市的影響、基本利率的釐定公式、香港貨幣實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。小組委員會討論的記錄及提交給該小組委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，載於香港金融管理局網站上。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續贊助有關貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。2015年，該學會舉辦了16名研究 fellows，並載於27篇工作論文。\n\n學會舉辦了五場國際會議及研討會。主要的包括：\n\n* 一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟會議，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定性：中國與國際經驗」。會議呈交了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸泡沫與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供應等廣泛議題。\n* 五月舉行的香港金融研究中心與香港大學聯合會議，名為「香港金融研究中心－香港大學國際金融、制度與經濟增長會議」。會議涵蓋多種不同的經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n* 十月舉行的香港金融研究中心、美國聯邦儲備理事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行聯合會議，主題為「分歧的貨幣政策、全球資本流動與金融穩定」。會議探討了廣泛的議題，包括貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率的關係、分歧的貨幣政策及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該學會亦於8月舉辦了第13屆香港金融研究中心夏季研討會，並於9月舉行了第13屆香港金融研究中心中國大陸經濟會議，探討中國大陸財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。這些會議及研討會獲來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的參加者參與。此外，該學會在本年內舉辦了24場公開講座，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n2015年底，流通金額的紙幣總值為本港3602億港元，較早前一年上升5.3%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的紙幣及硬幣總流通金額為112億港元，上升2.9%（圖9及10）。流通的政府發行10港元紙幣價值為40億港元，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在獲授權機構的風險管理上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為。面對系統性風險的積聚，香港金融管理局於2016年1月1日宣布在香港實施0.625%的逆周期資本緩衝，並於2017年1月1日提高至1.25%。五間獲授權機構被指定為系統重要性銀行，將會面臨更高的損失吸收資本緩衝要求。在引入《金融機構（紓困及重整）條例》草案至立法會後，有關復原及重整的改革取得重大進度。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業界的合作，以加強基本銀行服務的可接觸性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融專業人士的技能及知識發展。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策路向出現分歧的跡象下，2015年新興市場面臨資本外流風險上升及經濟增長放緩的壓力。為維持銀行業在經濟環境可能突然惡化的情況下保持韌性，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察認可機構（AIs）風險治理制度及其信貸及流動性風險管理系統的成效。\n\n# 操作監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採納監管方法，即定期現場檢查輔以較多的主題審查。主題審查是深入的非現場審查，重點放在特定風險範疇或部分認可機構的特定活動上。此方法使香港金融管理局能夠將其監管資源重點放在認可機構的出現及較重要的風險上。\n\n全年期間，香港金融管理局共進行了193次現場檢查。鑑於信貸風險管理及資產質素方面出現惡化跡象，香港金融管理局亦進行了更多深入主題的現場檢查。鑑於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策出現分歧，市場不確定性增加，香港金融管理局亦增加了對與財務部門相關活動的檢查數目。此外，亦進行了與內地相關業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制及內置評級（IRB）模型的現場檢查。全年期間，亦有專門小組對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）相關業務等AIs的業務進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查相同範疇的領域。表1包含運作監督工作的詳情。\n\n2015 年，對 AIs 進行了 196 次現場外評估，以評估其公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管關注點集中於風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸及巴塞爾 III 標準的推行情況。監管小組持續與部分 AIs 的董事會及外部會計師保持密切聯繫。與 AIs 的高層管理及外部會計師舉行了 20 次三方會議，同時與部分 AIs 的全體董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了 23 日會議。\n\n銀行監督審查委員會考慮了四個個案，均涉及認可機構的授權事宜。\n\n為更有效地運用其監管資源以處理競爭性優先事項，香港金融管理局繼續根據《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求認可機構委任外部會計師跟進潛在重大監管問題。香港金融管理局於2015年根據此條款委託六份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢\/反恐融資控制，另一兩份報告涵蓋私人銀行業務，而餘下報告則涉及包括證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等範疇。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，沒有任何人工智能違反銀行條例有關資本充足率或流動性比率的要求。根據條例各項條文共有84宗違規情況，但並未影響存款人的利益，且已由認可機構迅速處理。\n\n表1 操作監督\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc 仍然受 Banking Ordinance 第 52 條所賦予的權限所規管。2008 年 6 月 25 日，貨幣管理局根據 Banking Ordinance 第 52(1)(A) 條，對 Melli Bank Plc 香港分行的業務、營業及財產所採取的指示，在該財政年度內仍然有效。香港金融管理局會繼續與有關認可機構保持定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其在英國總行相關的發展情況，並會留意已採取的監察措施，以保護認可機構存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評級審查\n\nCAMEL審批委員會檢討並制定AIs的綜合CAMEL評級。AIs已知悉評級結果，並獲給予機會請求重審。該年度內無任何重審請求。\n\n# 專門監督工作\n\n# 運營及科技風險的監督\n\n香港金融管理局鑑於不斷出現的新風險及業界發展，繼續發行有關運作及科技風險管理的新指引或更新指引。特別是，香港金融管理局已完成對《監管政策手冊》（SPM）中有關電子銀行（e-banking）模組的修訂，容許認可機構在提供新的電子銀行服務時有更多靈活性。此外，香港金融管理局亦發行了一則通函，重申認可機構的董事及高層管理人員須對有效的網絡安全風險管理有監督責任。香港金融管理局亦定期發佈其「運作事件通報」，重點介紹部分詐騙個案或運作事件的作案手法，以及所識別出的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局進行以風險為基礎的主題性現場及非現場監察審查，以評估部分認可機構在企業層面或特定業務範疇內的運作及科技風險管理情況。這些審查涵蓋與認可機構運作風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防範違規交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、詐欺風險管理及反洗錢科技控制有關的特定範疇。這些監察審查亦輔以年度獨立合規活動，涵蓋運作風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性計劃，其中部分認可機構須委任獨立且具資格的評估者，以審查其有關控制措施的充足性，並糾正所識別的弱點。香港金融管理局亦識別及分析認可機構運作及科技風險的趨勢及重點監察範疇，特別是那些在維護香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定及有效運作方面發揮重要作用的機構。\n\n香港金融管理局監察了銀行業在2015年底推行基於晶片的自動櫃員機技術的最後階段，透過該技術，認可機構已完成純信用卡的換卡程序。香港金融管理局亦要求發卡認可機構落實認證控制，以進一步改善「無卡交易」信用卡交易的安全性。另一方面，接獲報告指某些無接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可被竊取訪問後，香港金融管理局要求有關認可機構迅速採取行動，通知及保護受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局亦投放資源，向公眾闡釋事件的規模及影響，以解決公眾關注，並監察認可機構的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他持份者協作，推行多項措施，包括舉行有關網上銀行安全預防措施的意識提升計劃、設立一個分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為由香港金融服務業業務持續性管理論壇舉辦的危機管理演練提供支援及意見，該演練涉及認可機構及其他金融公司。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構密切合作，就指導及監督認可機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供協助。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構委員會的主持下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議涵蓋涉及不同金融服務行業領域內具有密切業務關係的金融集團或受規管機構的各種問題，以確保監管行動更加協調及有效。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局進行了25次現場及非現場主題檢查及15次非現場監察。這些檢查涵蓋了投資產品的銷售、證券交易結算處理及客戶證券的安全保管，以及非連結長期人壽保險（NLTI）產品及與強積金（MPF）相關產品的銷售，涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶。\n\n8月，香港金融管理局向認可機構發行 circular，提供有關向客戶銷售非壽險投資產品時進行適合性評估及產品資訊披露的指引。該指引旨在協助認可機構遵守監管標準，包括7月由保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會發行的有關要求。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與財政司司長辦公室（財政司）在2014年保險公司（修訂）條例的立法過程中緊密合作，以設立一個獨立的保險業監管局及為保險中介機構設立法定發牌制度。7 月，立法會通過了2015年保險公司（修訂） ordinance，其中包含其他內容，賦予貨幣管理局透過授權，在方面AIs的保險中介業務進行審查及調查的權限。\n\n金管局處理了六宗申請成為註冊機構（RIs）及一宗由RIs提出的增發的受規管活動申請。金管局已授予204名負責監督RIs證券業務的高級人員同意，並就由RIs提交以納入金管局維持的登記冊內的9,697名人士的資料進行背景調查。\n\n# 財務活動監督\n\n認可機構的流動性風險管理仍然屬於香港金融管理局的重點監管範疇，尤其鑑於美國利率預期將正常化，以及隨後可能出現的資金流動反轉，這可能會對認可機構的流動性狀況產生影響。2015年全年，香港金融管理局持續落實對認可機構的強化穩定資金要求，以維持充足穩定資金支持其貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起實施巴塞爾三協議流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）以來，香港金融管理局一直監測第一類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構的LCR一般維持在接近或超過百分之一百的水平，遠高於2015年在推行安排下法定最低60%的標準。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）就預期利率正常化所相關的風險，對部分人工智能（AI）的控制架構進行主題性現場審查。在市場波動的背景下，HKMA亦密切關注市場的突然變化及其對銀行業及個別AI的影響，並採取適當後續行動。\n\n# 管理者驅動的壓力測試方案\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行自下而上的監管機構主導壓力測試計劃，以更好地了解在極端及不利經濟情況下本地註冊零售銀行的抗風險能力，並鼓勵它們制定計劃以應對壓力時期潛在的問題。本年度為收集更詳細的資料，以獲得對部分範疇風險動態的深入了解，已推行若干改進措施。香港金融管理局分析了參與認可機構提交的結果，並與它們討論如何進一步優化其壓力測試程序。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信用成長與資產品質\n\n過去幾年觀察到的強勁信貸成長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已趨緩。全年來看，銀行業總貸款增加3.5%，較2014年的12.7%為低（表2）。由於客戶存款成長速度高於銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率從一年前的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，呼籲加強國際間的協作與溝通以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及地區性會議，不遺餘力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，並善用人民幣國際化以進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港強健的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現繼續獲得信用評級機構的認可，標準普爾亦維持對香港的頂級AAA評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，就影響全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題提出意見。7 月，其擔任亞洲金融穩定委員會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）的共同主席一職，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定委員會成員與非成員之間在政策措施上的互動，鼓勵推行金融改革，並增進有關金融穩定議題的意見交換。香港金融管理局繼續與亞太經合組織加三體系機構密切合作，強化亞太經合組織加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作——該辦公室已升格為國際組織——以監察及分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n本年，香港的離岸人民幣池及債券發行因多項市場因素而出現一定程度的收縮。然而市場仍能有序運作，人民幣結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易維持穩定增長。此外，香港進行及透過香港進行的人民幣業務日益增加，促進了國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）將人民幣確認為可自由使用的貨幣。IMF將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子的決定，將為人民幣國際化以及香港離岸市場的進一步發展增添動力。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及高效運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球場外人民幣業務中心的競爭優勢方面發揮重要作用。2015年，香港人民幣支付系統的成交額創下新高，同時，場外衍生工具的交易報庫繼續支持機構根據新場外衍生工具市場監管制度的規定，提交其場外衍生工具交易。該監管制度於7月推出。\n\n香港金融基礎設施在2015年獲香港金融管理局進一步加強，新增了多項組件及服務，包括於12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著目前已有超過150間銀行可透過互聯網及手機渠道，為其客戶收取及處理電子支票。電子帳單及繳費服務（EBPP）於2013年推出，2015年繼續見證商家參與度的增長。7月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）在其資金訂單路由服務下推出了一項服務，以支持內地與香港資金互認安排（MRF）的推行。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦於11月開始實施《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）。根據PSSVFO，香港金融管理局獲賦權推行針對多用途儲值支付工具的強制性牌照制度，並履行相關的監管及執行職能，同時亦可指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全及高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫增加，香港金融管理局積極透過國際及區域性會議，包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），促進與其他司法管轄區的合作，以助發展可持續的經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦繼續落實全球金融監管改革，包括G20的建議，以應付強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局於7月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）區域諮詢組（RCG(A)）的共同主席，並於10月在香港舉辦了第九次會議。RCG(A)為FSB成員及非成員提供一個重要的溝通與合作平台，以處理金融穩定相關事宜。來自16個亞洲司法管轄區財政部、中央銀行及金融監管局的高級代表出席會議，討論該地區所面對的風險、資產管理活動日益增加的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險制度的經驗。香港金融管理局亦於8月在香港共同主持了一場關於宏觀審慎政策的研討會，該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）舉辦，並邀請來自世界各地18個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了有關宏觀審慎政策的經驗，重點探討工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能產生的外溢效應。香港金融管理局亦與英倫銀行及國際貨幣基金組織共同舉辦了一場會議，討論中央銀行及其他政策制定者在選擇最佳貨幣政策、宏觀審慎政策及微觀審慎政策組合時所面對的挑戰。該會議吸引了逾百名與會者參與，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 以助發展亞洲的貨幣與金融穩定\n\n香港金融管理局繼續承諾推動區域合作措施，以促進亞洲金融穩定，並發揮地區整體聲音，在國際金融事務中發揮影響力。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行會議（EMEAP）下設的貨幣與金融穩定委員會宏觀監察工作的協調人，香港金融管理局繼續準備委員會的半年度宏觀監察報告，以評估該地區的風險與不穩定因素及其政策影響。作為支付與結算系統工作小組的主席，香港金融管理局與副主席密切合作，推動小組在風險管理、監管、標準與最佳實踐，以及本地及跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗交流與資訊分享。香港金融管理局亦領導小組內有關跨境合作與發展的分組。香港金融管理局於6月在香港舉辦東亞太平洋國際結算銀行（EMEAP\/BIS）外匯市場論壇及東亞太平洋金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議。來自地區內17個機構及主要經濟體的代表參與會議，會議檢討了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革情況。\n\n繼去年香港與亞太經合組織+3當局簽訂AMRO協議後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在加強版清邁倡議多邊化下的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與國際信用評級機構保持緊密溝通，以呈報香港經濟表現及財政實力的平衡評估。這些努力促進了所有主要信用評級機構於2015年對香港信用評級的肯定。標準普爾肯定香港的最高AAA評級，反映該機構對香港高收入經濟體的龐大財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現及強勁的淨外資產地位所給予的肯定，預期其經濟展望優於平均水平。穆迪投資服務及惠譽評級亦分別維持香港的評級於Aa1及AA+，僅低於三A級別一級。\n\n# 香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港人民幣資金池產生影響。年底時，人民幣客戶存款及存款憑證總額達人民幣1,010億元，較去年同期人民幣1,158億元為低（圖1）。面對內地市場利率下跌，離岸人民幣債券發行放緩。結果，香港發行人民幣債券總額降至人民幣750億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增加9%至人民幣6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款餘額亦較去年同期上升58%至人民幣297億元（圖2）。人民幣實時總結算（RTGS）系統平均每日交易額增至人民幣947億元，較2014年上升29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步增長，根據調查結果，2015年4月底人民幣日均交易額達約930億美元等值，較2013年4月上次國際貨幣基金組織三週年調查時上升88%。香港仍然為全球最大離岸人民幣業務中心，市場具備相當廣度及深度。另一項強化此地位的重要發展是2015年7月推行的人民幣資金池計劃，該計劃已擴大香港人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局擴大跨境人民幣資金流渠道的政策舉措，以及與業界合作優化香港人民幣金融平台的措施，持續產生成果。6月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣業務結算銀行及參與銀行將被容許在內地銀行間債券市場進行回购交易並將所得資金匯出境外，以增進離岸市場銀行的人民幣流動性管理。9月，PBoC放寬跨境人民幣現金池管理規則，使更多跨国公司能在簡化安排下進行集團內資金轉移。同時，內地當局亦於7月授予外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金較廣泛的內地銀行間債券市場准入權，並於9月進一步開放內地外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n2016年10月1日生效，國際貨幣基金組織宣布將人民幣納入特別提款權貨幣籃子。此決定肯定人民幣作為可自由使用的貨幣地位，並進一步推動人民幣在全球交易中使用的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球人民幣離岸業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化及內地與全球經濟金融體系更緊密聯繫所帶來的新業務機會中受惠。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同舉辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣業務論壇，並與馬來西亞及泰國第二次合作，促進私人部門就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些措施，香港銀行加強了與其他市場在人民幣業務方面的業務流動及聯網，這將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強其市場推廣工作，透過參與香港及海外市場包括加拿大、日本及非洲的行業活動，促進公司及機構在貿易、投資及融資方面較廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁黃偉雄先生於2015年12月11日香港－倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間出席研討會發言。\n\n# CEPA\n\n於11月，中國大陸與香港根據緊密經濟合作安排（CEPA）框架簽署了一項新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年在廣東推行的大部分試點自由化措施擴展至全國範圍。透過根據國民待遇原則，原則上給予香港銀行與本地銀行相同的待遇，新協議預期將為這些銀行在中國大陸從事業務時提供更多的政策確定性與較大的靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行監管局的官員提供培訓課程。除有關中央銀行及一般風險管理的課程外，亦包括消費者保護、信貸參考、貨幣及擔保管理、財務健全指標分析及系統性風險監測等主題。亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表舉辦臨時培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n全年期間，本港金融管理局安排了八次機構政府債券投標，金額為204億港元。至2015年底，機構債券的總未償金額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based

資產管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未見的挑戰。在如此艱鉅嚴苛且困難的投資環境下，發行基金在2015年的整體投資回報為-0.6%，但相較於主要市場指數及可比較的投資基金，其虧損則相對溫和，這是由於香港金融管理局在過去數年所採取的一系列防禦性部署，這些措施提升了發行基金的抗風險能力。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n香港發鈔銀行的首要目標，如《發鈔銀行條例》所訂明，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。該基金亦可被用來維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以應付香港作為國際金融中心的需要。香港發鈔銀行受財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，將其投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 財政儲備基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候皆能全面由流通性極高的美國貨幣單位資產所支撐；\n(c) 確保為維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的，有充足流動性可供使用；以及\n(d) 會面對 (a) — (c)，以達到有助於維持基金長期購買力之投資報酬。\n\n這些目標採用十足考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n\n大致而言，發行基金有兩大資產組合 — 支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，以提供十足支持予貨幣基礎，這是由貨幣發行局制度所規定的。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保障資產價值及長遠的購買力。兩大組合整體的長期目標債券與股票比例為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，81%的資產配置於美元及港元，餘下19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險及優化中長期回報，香港金融管理局已以謹慎及循序漸進的方式，將部分發行基金的投資分散至較大範疇的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券及股票、私人股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券及股票由投資組合持有，而私人股權及物業投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。香港金融管理局在LTGP下投資的淨資產價值上限維持為發行基金累積結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下投資的市值總計為1,421億港元，其中包括私人股權的913億港元及物業投資的508億港元，並有1,224億港元的投資承諾未履行。\n\n於2007年設立的策略性投資組合，用以持有香港交易所及清算有限公司的股份，這些股份是由政府為交易所基金的策略性目的而收購，由於此投資組合的性質獨特，因此不包括在基金投資表現的評估範疇內。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券交易所基金的投資過程分別以兩種資產配置類型為基礎 —— 策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資指標上，顯示證券交易所基金投資目標下的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性配置的指引下，資產會採用戰略性配置方式，爭取在指標之上取得超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與指標或策略性配置有所不同。實際配置與指標配置之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏差」。雖然指標及戰略性偏差的上限是由財政司在與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後制定，但戰略性決定則由香港金融管理局在授權範圍內作出。在戰略性偏差允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可採用投資策略，以利用短期市場走勢的機會。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部門的員工直接管理約76%的發行基金投資，包括整體支持組合及投資組合的部分。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一組組合，以及各種實行宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具覆蓋組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理人員\n\n除內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦聘請設於多個國際金融中心的外部基金管理機構，管理約24%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產。聘請外部管理機構的目的是運用市場上可得的最優投資專業技術，以捕捉多元化投資形式，並將市場的知識及資訊轉移至內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部經理有關的支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易費用以及預扣及其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素所制定，且可每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。為內部及外聘管理的投資組合已設立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規則的遵守情況。風險控制工具被調配以評估在正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以最優化地使用內部及外部管理者的投資技能。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球財務市場極為波動。尤其股市遭遇前所未見的動盪。主要股市在上半年錄得新高。然而，市場情緒在第三季急轉直下，帶來對中國經濟增長的憂慮，主要股市因而失守自年初以來的收益，並錄得顯著的季度虧損。其後，隨著市場情緒改善，全球股市稍為回升，但年底又再度惡化。由於與中國經濟緊密聯繫，香港股市在2015年表現遜於其他主要股市。\n\n在公債市場上，儘管預期美國將進行利率正常化，且美國利率上行週期已經開始，2015年較長期美國國債收益率適度上升。正面情緒因對全球經濟成長的憂慮、持續存在的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張關係升溫而受到遏抑。另一方面，短線歐洲政府債券收益率下跌，有些甚至跌至負面領域，這是因應歐洲央行大力貨幣寬鬆政策所導致的。\n\n在外匯市場，美元在2015年繼續強化，美元指數接近飆升10%，下於美國政策利率正常化啟動的預期。歐元在首輪表現顯著走弱，自1999年以來，歐元對美元出現最大單季跌幅，因歐洲央行於1月宣布實行量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在2015年對美元大致維持平穩。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現載於表1。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n在極為波動的金融市場及艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境情況下，發行基金於2015年錄得投資虧損本港幣158億元，包括在外資股票取得收益本港幣71億元、在香港股票取得虧損本港幣50億元、在債券取得收益本港幣159億元、因轉作本港幣而產生的負面匯率影響本港幣449億元，以及在基金投資持倉子公司所持其他投資取得收益本港幣111億元。在去年美元急升的情況下，將發行基金的非美元投資轉作港幣時，產生負面匯率影響屬不可避免。另一方面，策略性投資組合錄得評值收益本港幣22億元。\n\n本港發行機構的總資產於2015年底達到34,229億港元。2015年，發行機構的投資回報（不包括策略性組合）為-0.6%。儘管如此，與主要市場指數及投資基金社會表現較遜色的情況相比，發行機構的虧損可視為溫和。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局在過去數年已部署一系列防禦性部署，包括縮短債券組合的年期、增加現金持有量，以及顯著減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化步伐，特別是透過長期資產組合計劃下的投資。這些部署已增強發行機構的抗風險能力，並有助減少一些潛在虧損。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年均回報率列於圖1。表2顯示2015年的投資回報率，以及基金在不同年期的平均投資回報率。過去三年的平均回報率為1.2%，過去五年的平均回報率為1.8%，過去十年的平均回報率為3.3%，自1994年以來的平均回報率為5.0%。表3顯示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組成。\n\n圖1

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及各種其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以增進對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，香港金融管理局透過推動員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安及重整高層管理人員職責，以應付因推行新計劃及系統及工作日益繁重而帶來的挑戰，優化公司治理。\n\n# 參與社區企業發展\n\n# 傳媒關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒密切合作，以改善透明度及促進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。2015年，共舉行了59項公開媒體活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14場站立式訪問及31項其他公開活動。此外，亦安排了43次媒體訪問，發佈了325份雙語新聞發佈會，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為提升公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，分別舉辦兩場媒體參觀活動，前往香港紙幣印刷有限公司及香港銀行間清算有限公司（HKICL），以展示香港的世界級紙幣印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時，亦就貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及發行基金舉行教育講座，為媒體提供更深入的簡介，以加強對這些重要議題的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁德霖先生（中）及貨幣管理總經理李 Howard 先生（右）於到訪香港印鈔有限公司期間，檢查紙幣上的安全特徵。\n\n自動支票分類演示活動於媒體參觀香港國際商業信貸銀行（HKICL）期間舉行。照片中間（由左至右）為香港金融管理局總裁德霖先生、財務基礎設施總經理李志明先生，以及香港國際商業信貸銀行總裁譚慧珊女士。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供一個有效的途徑，以取得香港金融管理局的資訊，讓他們更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務在2015年處理了9,078宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢涉及銀行政策及規則、紙幣及硬幣，以及消費者銀行服務問題。值得注意的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收藏計劃。\n\n圖1顯示自2012年起接獲的公眾查詢數目，圖2則顯示2015年查詢性質的分類。\n\n圖 1 總數目之公眾查詢\n\n# 刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，香港金融管理局在過去一年內亦發表了兩份上半年貨幣及金融穩定報告、四份季度通訊及定期發佈月度統計通訊的最新資料，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新資料及主題分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇涵蓋各種熱門及適時政策議題的洞察文章。\n\n香港金融管理局2014年度報告接獲香港管理協會2015年度最優惠年度報告獎項中「非營利機構及慈善組織」類別的銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）以英語及傳統及簡體中文提供超過五萬頁的資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有獲認可機構（AIs）證券從業員名冊及獲認可機構及其本地代表辦事處名冊，並根據《銀行條例》第20條維持有關名冊。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的推行，網站將亦載有根據該條例發出的儲值支付工具牌照持有人名冊。為引起公眾對一些重要及適時資訊的關注，例如提醒公眾需保持警覺以應對詐騙來電及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣推車的設置位置等資訊，已設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心設於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向社會介紹香港金融管理局工作及推廣公眾對貨幣及銀行事務意識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，並於週一至週六開放公眾使用。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展，並包括有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n資訊中心為訪客舉辦導賞參觀活動。本年，中心接獲超過48,300名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過630次導賞參觀（圖3）。自2003年12月資訊中心開放以來，已有超過530,400人到訪該中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區毗鄰，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，用以詳細研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據銀行條例第20條的規定，保持香港認可機構的電子登記冊。\n\n在持續推行的社會接觸計劃下，香港金融管理局繼續舉辦公開教育講座。2015年，為約2,300名中學生及教師舉辦了三場講座。主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智醒使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年計劃推出以來，已有超過54,700人參與該計劃。\n\n圖 3 參觀資訊中心的團體種類\n\n學童訪客在導覽員的指引下參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n二手學校學生及教師參與公開教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招聘、培訓及維持一支具備極高專業水平的工作隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對工作優先事項的變化。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的一部分，但其可採用與公務員不同的條件僱用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗及專業投資技術的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局的目標是保持機構規模精簡靈活，並調配員工資源以推行新措施，並應對工作量的增加。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n繼支付系統及儲值支付工具條例頒佈後，香港金融管理局於2015年12月在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立零售支付監察組，以履行香港金融管理局在儲值支付工具及其他零售支付系統的牌照發放及日常監管方面的新法定職責。為優化部門之間的協同效應，並重新調配員工資源以應付推行新措施所帶來的挑戰，以及日益繁重的工作量和工作複雜性，有關部門於2015年計劃進行部門職責重組，並於2016年初推行。詳情如下：\n\n金融基建部（FID）接辦了法規部（ENFD）及貨幣處（MMD）所負責的存款保障計劃的行政工作及結算功能。亦接辦了銀行業相關的工作，例如消費者教育、董事培訓及銀行從業人員的增強能力架構，由銀行部門負責。\n\n外部門接過MMD的市場開發功能，而後者將繼續處理與財務指標及國庫市場協會有關的工作；且\n\nenFD 從銀行監督部門接辦反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險部門，並更名為執法及反洗錢部門。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 人手編制\n\n2015年香港金融管理局的成立為841名。2016年此數字增加34至875名（增加4%），以確保提供充足資源應付（i）推行新法例及措施，（ii）繼續進行已證明為必要且持續進行的試驗計劃，以及（iii）現行工作的日益繁重及工作量上升。新職位將調配至以下職能：\n\n加強銀行及金融穩定，包括：\n\n加強銀行監督工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場檢查、推行國際銀行標準及同儕審查 exercises；\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網路安全風險管理的監督；\n\n推行有關場外衍生產品的監管架構，該架構係透過銀行及經批准的場外衍生產品報表及記錄規則所進行，並適用於新生效的場外衍生產品報表及記錄規則；\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法工作；\n\n籌備推行《金融機構（紓困）條例》的相關工作，以國際標準解決金融業「太大而不能倒」的問題；\n\n透過發展一個針對銀行獨立非執行董事的權力提升計劃，以促進銀行業界的能力建設，進而改善銀行的治理結構，並與業界合作，促進銀行從業人員在銀行運作核心範疇內的專業能力框架提升。\n\n加強在新銀行、證券及保險產品方面的銀行行為政策與研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；並\n\n加強監測及分析人民幣在岸市場及CNH市場的發展情況，以推動香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對與未來基金成立及交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化相關的擴大投資活動之投資、風險管理及法律支援，並在投資環境日益艱鉅嚴苛的情況下，加強策略性資產配置及投資程序。\n\n推行新《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》所規定的法定制度，賦予香港金融管理局權力，以規管儲值支付工具及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業功能\n\n臨時資源被調配以滿足其他工作需求。香港金融管理局將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助香港或香港金融管理局感興趣的活動或措施。部分員工以全職或兼職形式被調配，以提供運作支援予香港存款保障局及財政市場協會。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）的建議，並考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括總現金包裝及職業退休金計劃，效益以基本形式呈現。現金包裝包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，浮動薪酬可根據表現，每年一次以現金形式頒發給個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局員工薪酬每年由財政司司長根據外匯基金諮詢委員會透過eFAC向他提出的建議進行檢討，考慮香港金融管理局在前一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融行業薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他有關因素。有需要時，可就個別表現優異的員工作出特別薪酬調整，以維持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬調整或香港金融管理局（HKMA）的浮動薪酬獎項，均根據員工的表現分發給個人員工。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員須遵守一個浮動薪酬制度，旨在強化其投資表現與薪酬獎項之間的聯繫。香港金融管理局高級職級（執行總監或以上）員工的薪酬調整或獎項，須根據財政司司長（FS）根據財務委員會（GSC）的建議批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬時並不在場。香港金融管理局低級職級（部門主管或以下）員工的薪酬調整或獎項，則由香港金融管理局總督根據財政司司長的授權，在批准的整體薪酬獎項範圍內制定。\n"}

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

交易所基金\n\n稽核長報告  \n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 職業會計師報告\n\n# 审计委员会\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）載於第134至222頁之財務報表，該報表包括交易所基金及集團於2015年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收入支出帳目、綜合損益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及重要會計政策概要及其他解釋性資料。\n\n# 財政部對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據行政長官根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條所作出的指示，按香港財務報告準則編製提供真實公允視點的財務報表，並負責貨幣管理局認為必要以確保編製無重大誤導的財務報表的內部控制，無論此誤導是出於詐欺或錯誤。\n\n# 會計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計工作，就這些財務報表表達意見。我根據香港發鈔兌換基金條例第7條所訂立的總督指令及審計委員會的審計準則進行審計。這些準則要求我遵守倫理要求，並計劃及執行審計工作，以取得合理保證，確保財務報表是否免受重大錯誤的影響。\n\n審計包括執行程序以取得有關財務報表中數額及披露的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括評估財務報表中重大錯誤的風險，無論是出於詐欺或錯誤。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製能提供真實且公允視圖的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計在情況下適當的審計程序，但並非為評估實體內部控制成效之目的。審計亦包括評估 Monetary Authority 所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及其所作出的會計估計是否合理，以及評估財務報表的整體呈現。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據是充足且適當的，足以作為我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 財務監察長報告（繼續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n依我之見，財務報表根據香港財務報告準則，真實而公允地反映了2015年12月31日交易所基金及其集團的財務狀況，以及該財務年度其財務表現及現金流量，並已根據《交易所基金條例》第7條所訂的行政長官指令妥為編製。\n\n孫大卫\n審計總監\n\n2016 年 4 月 7 日\n\n審計委員會  \n26樓  \n移民大樓  \n7 Gloucester Road  \n灣仔，香港\n\n#

財務報表附註\n\n（數額以千萬港元列示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n貨幣管理局根據財政司所授予的權限，作為發行基金（以下簡稱「基金」）的主管機構，按《發行基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。基金的主要職能是維持香港貨幣的兌換價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產被管理為四個組合：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略組合。支持組合的資產全面與香港貨幣基礎相符，根據香港的貨幣發行局制度。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長組合持有私人股權及不動產投資。策略組合持有香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的戰略目的而收購。營運部門資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 二 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據所有適用之香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個總稱，包括所有適用之個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發行之香港會計準則（HKASs）及解釋。此外，亦根據香港普遍接受之會計原則編製。基金及其子公司（以下統稱為集團）採用之重大會計政策概要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行若干新的及修訂的 HKFRSs，這些 HKFRSs 首輪生效或可於現行會計期間內提前採用。第三節提供有關這些發展首次採用所導致會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並反映於這些財務報表中現行及前會計期間的有關集團情況。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註（繼續）\n\n（數額以千萬港元列示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 22 財務報表編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團在合營企業及聯營公司的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務於附註16及17中載明。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除下列資產及負債以公允價值計列外，其餘均按歷史成本計列，如下列會計政策所述：\n\n交易金融工具（註 2.6.2.1）；指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（註 2.6.2.2）；可得銷售證券（註 2.6.2.5）；金（註 2.11）；及投資性不動產（註 2.12）。\n\n依循香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需管理層作出會影響政策應用及資產、負債、收入及開支所報告數額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設是基於經驗及各種其他因素，而這些因素在情況下被認為是合理的，其結果成為判斷那些非來自其他資料來源即能明顯看出的資產及負債攜帶價值的基礎。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行檢討。若修訂僅影響當期，則會在該估計被修訂的期間認可會計估計的修訂；若修訂同時影響當期及未來期間，則會在修訂期間及其後的各期認可會計估計的修訂。\n\n附註18包含有關投資性不動產公允價值評估的假設。附註37包含有關金融工具公允價值評估的假設。除附註2.5所載的若干金融工具的計值外，集團會計政策的應用不涉及關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司與非控制性權益\n\n子公司為集團所控制之實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而有權獲得浮動報酬，或有權獲得浮動報酬，且能透過其對該實體之控制權影響該報酬。評估集團是否具備控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他方持有）。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註（繼續）\n\n（數額以千萬港元列示，除非另有說明。）\n\n對子公司的投資自控制開始之日起，直至控制終止之日止，均納入集團財務報表中合併。\n\n集團財務報表編製時，會完全消除集團內各公司間的餘額、交易及現金流，以及因集團內交易而產生的未實現利得與損失。\n\n非控制權益代表屬於子公司但不直接或間接歸屬於基金的權益，且集團與這些權益持有人並未就這些權益訂立任何附加條款，而這些條款將導致集團整體產生符合財務負債定義的契約義務。非控制權益在集團資產負債表中於權益內列示，並與屬於基金所有者的權益分開列示。集團的非控制權益在集團損益表及綜合損益表中於表內列示，作為將當年度的利潤或虧損及總綜合損益在非控制權益與基金所有者之間進行分配。\n\n基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資以成本減去減值損失計入（註 2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 合夥人及聯營公司\n\n一個關聯實體是指集團透過其購買力參與該實體的財務及營運政策決策，而對其管理具有重大影響力，但並未擁有控制權或共同控制權之實體。\n"}
