{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","zh":"2019年並非無事發生的一年。\n\n中美貿易緊張局勢仍是重要的變數。世界兩大經濟體之間的貿易談判仍存在許多不確定性，令投資者信心受挫，並對國際貿易、製造業、投資甚至消費造成打擊。全球經濟擴張已不再是理所當然的事。整體經濟在該年度進入同步放緩的狀態。面對較慢的增長，全球主要央行已轉而改變貨幣政策正常化的路線。\n\n本地社會事件在本年下半段進一步打擊香港經濟。零售、旅遊及飲食業是受影響最嚴重的行業之一。整體而言，香港經濟在2019年出現1.2%的跌幅，這是十年來首次出現年度經濟衰退，同時失業率亦由年初的多年低點2.8%上升至3.3%。當2020年來臨時，新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19）爆發又為全球及本地經濟帶來另一重大威脅。\n\n面對如此不確定且具有挑戰性的環境，維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定至關重要，這一點我在2019年10月1日接任香港金融管理局總裁時已明確表達。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的根基\n\n自1983年起實施的聯繫匯率制度（LERS），協助香港成功應對多項挑戰與衝擊，展現其作為香港經濟繁榮及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管當年面對嚴峻的國際與本地環境，聯繫匯率制度仍能順利有序地運作，再一次證明其在不確定時期的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦持續穩健強健。事實言明一切：香港貨幣兌換率維持穩定，最近幾個月更進一步強化至可兌換範圍的強方；而銀行存款在當年持續增長。總而言之，未觀察到明顯的港元或銀行體系資金外流情況。\n\n香港貨幣及銀行體系的穩定，不僅反映我們體系的強韌，也體現了對我們體系的強大信心。這並非一夕之間形成的，而是經過多年努力建立緩衝機制及加強監測，並配合我們對社交媒體平台上流傳的謠言迅速作出回應的結果。\n\n多年來我們為應對雨天所做的準備，已為香港的貨幣及銀行體系奠定了堅實基礎，並建立了強大的緩衝能力。除了我們公帑內龐大的外匯儲備外，香港的銀行體系亦具備強大的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性以及非常優良的資產質素，無論以國際標準或歷史標準來衡量皆然。自2009年起實施的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，亦大大增強了銀行體系對房地產市場下行的抗風險能力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監管是我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們亦不時加強監察及監管架構。除了密切監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險外，今年我們的新舉措之一，是運用從銀行收集的科技及細粒度數據，以更深入及及時的方式提升監察港元融資及金融市場活動的能力。同時，亦根據經濟及營運環境的快速變化，加強壓力測試及應急計劃的制定。\n\n事實上，我們強而有力的監管制度已獲得國際上的廣泛認可。今年，國際貨幣基金組織重申，香港具備充足的緩衝能力，足以應對周期性及結構性變動。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資方面的有效法律及制度框架，亦獲得金融行動特別小組（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太地區首個在FATF相互評估中取得總體符合標準結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，對維護貨幣及金融穩定至關重要。為維持市場信心，我們必須提高警覺，並迅速回應任何可能對香港貨幣或銀行體系造成質疑的惡意謠言。尤其在當前社交媒體和即時通訊工具廣泛使用的背景下，這一點尤為重要。在社會動盪期間，一些煽動者在社交媒體平台上散佈各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速而清晰地反駁這些謠言，證明了這對澄清事實、遏制謠言進一步傳播，以及維護國際及公眾對我們體系的信心，具有積極而有效的成效。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，對於確保社會與經濟的順暢運作具有基礎性的角色。儘管自年中以來營運環境持續嚴峻，銀行仍與其他機構共同努力，竭盡所能維持核心功能的正常運作，並持續為企業與大眾提供服務。\n\n除了存款及轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的重要功能之一是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們清楚了解並關注在困難的經濟環境下，企業，特別是中小企業（SMEs）所面對的現金流問題。在確保銀行體系穩定的同時，我們已推出一系列措施，以確保對中小企業的資金支持持續進行。特別是在2019年10月及2020年3月，銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率兩次調降，總共調降了150個基點，降至1.0%；2020年4月，銀行的準備金率亦減半。這些措施釋放了約1萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多的空間，以對企業，包括中小企業進行貸款。我們亦設立了一個平台——香港銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，集合香港主要銀行，探討及討論加強對中小企業資金支持的具體措施。我很欣慰地看到，許多銀行已積極回應我們的呼籲，並為有需要的客戶推出減免措施，例如貸款本金寬限期，以幫助他們渡過風暴。\n\n鑑於部分中小企業在開設銀行帳戶時遇到困難，而開設銀行帳戶是接觸各種銀行服務的第一步，我們在過去幾年來已致力於解決這個問題。我們的工作已見成效，企業開戶情況已有所改善。為進一步推動金融包容性，香港金融管理局率先推出了分層帳戶服務——簡化銀行帳戶（簡稱「簡易銀行帳戶」，SBAs），並採用簡化客戶盡職調查程序，為新創企業和中小企業提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。截至目前為止，已開設超過2,800個簡易銀行帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：持續強勁發展\n\n我們始終謹記在規管與發展之間尋求合理平衡的需要。考慮到金融中心之間激烈的競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其長遠的穩定。我們有四大重點工作領域：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫以及人才發展。\n\n# 在數位時代擁抱科技\n\n自2016年香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室成立，以及2017年推出智能銀行計劃以來，香港在推動金融科技（金融科技）方面不斷加快步伐。\n\n在支付領域，金融科技生態系統的活力體現在快速支付系統（FPS）的廣泛採用上。FPS 是全球首個支持多種貨幣、跨銀行及電子錢包的實時零售支付平台。僅在短短 15 個月內，FPS 的註冊用戶數便達到四百萬，這在人口為七百五十萬的群體中，顯示出極高的滲透率。政府亦已採用 FPS，為公眾提供更便捷的稅款、費用及水費繳納方式。越來越多企業預計將使用這種快速、安全且便捷的支付方式，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業界，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務運作方面取得了顯著進展。根據香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行的研究，幾乎有90%受訪的零售銀行已採用或計劃採用人工智能技術於其業務應用中。在HKMA的協助下，銀行已開始運用大數據及消費者行為分析技術於個人信貸產品上。他們已在前兩階段推出了超過800個開放應用程式介面（API），涵蓋多種銀行產品及服務。雖然鼓勵銀行運用金融科技，我們並未忽略在數字銀行服務中加強科技風險管理及消費者保護的必要性。在這些領域，已及時向銀行提供監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行極為關注的另一個領域，因其潛力可協助銀行更高效且更具成本效益地進行合規及風險管理，尤其是在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界更廣泛採用Regtech，並建立更廣泛的Regtech生態系統，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於11月舉辦了首屆AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發佈首期Regtech通訊，探討Regtech的潛在應用案例。同時，作為銀行監管機構，HKMA亦正在探索運用監管科技（Suptech），包括新的數據科學與分析技術，以提升監管工作的效率與成效。我們已啟動一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年推行Suptech的路線圖。\n\n從更廣泛的視角來看，這僅僅是金融科技在銀行業發展的開始。香港金融管理局今年已向八家虛擬銀行發出牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行已在2020年3月正式啟動服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行則已透過香港金融管理局的金融科技監管沙盒展開試點試行。我期待其他虛擬銀行的正式啟動，以及更多創新和多樣化的銀行服務引入香港，以提升我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n國際層面上亦預期有更多令人振奮的發展。在成功完成將我們基於區塊鏈的貿易融資平台 eTradeConnect 與其歐洲對應平台連接的可行性驗證（PoC）試驗後，我們正進行另一項與中國人民銀行平台的 PoC 試驗，為跨境貿易的數位化奠定基礎。我們已與泰國銀行展開聯合研究專案，研究央行數位貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行亦於11月在香港啟用其首間創新中心，以促進中央銀行界內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展清楚地顯示香港在全球金融科技發展中的領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色與永續金融，邁向更美好的未來\n\n近年來，與氣候相關的風險已引起全球越來越多的關注。為響應全球努力應對這項挑戰，香港金融管理局於五月份公布了三項關鍵措施，以不同方式推動香港綠色金融的發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局正推行三階段策略，以推動綠色及可持續銀行業。第一階段已制定一套評估銀行「綠色程度」的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定監管預期及要求，以及第三階段的落實工作奠定基礎。\n\n作為證券及期貨事務監察委員會的管理機構，香港金融管理局積極推動負責任投資，將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素融入其投資活動中。具體而言，我們採用在風險調整後的長期回報與其他投資相當的情況下，優先考慮綠色及ESG投資的原則。自2015年作為早期投資者之一進入綠色債券市場後，我們將持續擴大綠色債券投資組合，並投資其他ESG資產。我們亦將與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，透過參與ESG領域的國際組織，推動ESG最佳實踐。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n2019年香港經濟出現收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、中美貿易爭端持續以及本地社會事件的影響。隨著年中經濟情況迅速惡化，勞動市場面臨日益增加的壓力。由於豬肉價格急劇上升，通貨膨脹亦有所上升。預計2020年經濟表現仍將困難，因新型冠狀病毒疫情衝擊本已疲弱的經濟。面對困難的經濟環境，政府與香港金融管理局已推出措施支持經濟，特別是家庭及中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n繼2018年擴張2.9%之後，香港經濟在2019年出現1.2%的收縮，這是自2009年以來首次出現年度經濟收縮。尤其在年中，經濟陷入衰退，季節調整後的實質國內生產總值（GDP）連續三個季度（第二、第三及第四季）出現下滑（見表1）。經濟活動的減弱反映內在需求顯著減少（見圖1）。由於本地社會事件在年後半段對消費活動及情緒造成重大影響，私人消費開支出現自2003年以來的首次年度下降。整體投資開支亦因企業情緒受抑而減少。在外圍方面，全球經濟增長放緩，加上美國與中國貿易摩擦所引發的額外關稅，導致香港貨物出口減少。服務業出口亦出現歷來最大的年度跌幅，因社會事件導致入境旅遊嚴重惡化。由於內在需求及轉口所引發的需求較小，貨物及服務進口亦有所惡化。總體而言，淨貿易在2019年對GDP作出正面貢獻（見圖1），因總進口減少速度高於總出口。\n\n鑑於強勁的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間推出多輪措施，以減輕居民的財務負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企業（SMEs）以及受衝擊較大的行業，如零售、餐飲服務、運輸及旅遊業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，並協助緩解經濟週期，香港金融管理局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆週期資本緩衝比率由2.5%調降至2.0%，從而為銀行提供更大的靈活性，釋放約2000至3000億港元的銀行信貸予企業，包括中小企業，同時亦設立銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制。9月，中小企業融資擔保計劃（SFGS）的80%擔保產品推出新的纾困措施，讓面對資金流動性惡化的中小企業借款人可申請本金緩償，以獲得即時支援。此外，12月又推出SFGS下的新90%貸款擔保產品，以進一步支持中小企業、經營經驗相對較少的企業以及專業人士設立個人業務以取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n2019年，香港貨幣市場運作順暢有序，港元匯率全年大致維持穩定。3月觸發弱方保證措施後，香港金融管理局以每1美元7.85港元的匯率，向銀行購入港元並售出美元，導致根據聯繫匯率制度設計的總結餘額出現下降。港元銀行間長端利率大致維持穩定，而短端利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，數間零售銀行於10月下旬隨美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的下降，將最優惠貸款利率調低12.5個基點。至於貨幣總量，2019年總銀行貸款增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所上升，總存款則在當年增加2.9%。\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n扣除政府一次性纾困措施影響後的基礎通脹率，於2019年微升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%略高。通脹的溫和上升主要由自5月起鮮肉供應受阻所導致的豬肉價格上漲所推動（圖2）。排除基本食品後，全年價格壓力維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費者物價通脹中的住宅部分隨着私人住宅短租租金較早出現回穩而有所緩和。更廣泛而言，名義工資的溫和增長以及商業租金增幅放緩，有助於控制本地企業成本。在外圍方面，進口物價通脹有所減緩，與香港主要進口來源地通脹放緩以及全球經濟增長放緩的情況一致。\n\n# 就業市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場整體表現仍具韌性，但下半年面臨日益加劇的壓力（圖3）。在前兩個季度維持在多年來的低點2.8%後，經季節調整的失業率在第三季度上升至2.9%，第四季度則攀升至3.3%。在社會事件的影響下，與消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率上漲情況更加明顯。整體勞動需求在下半年也明顯減少，總就業人數與私人部門空缺人數均有所下降。勞動需求減少的情況在零售、住宿與餐飲服務業，以及進出口貿易與建設業中尤為明顯。在供給方面，勞動力參與率略有下降，部分原因是經濟衰退所引發的週期性反應。隨著勞動市場壓力不斷增加，名義工資與薪資的增長在年底出現減速跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2019年本地股市出現劇烈波動。前四個月市場一度上漲，但由於對中美貿易摩擦重新升級的擔憂，5月恆生指數急跌（圖4）。儘管6月因主要央行顯示出更為寬鬆的貨幣政策信號而部分收復失地，但隨着全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件的影響，股市再度受到壓力。年底時，隨著美國與中國大陸達成「第一階段」貿易協議的公告，股市重新恢復上漲動力。恆生指數全年以28,190點收市，全年總體上漲9.1%。相較之下，平均每日成交額則較去年同期下降約19%。一家主要大陸科技公司及一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，有助於2019年透過首次公開發行（IPO）籌集的股本資金達到3,142億港元。香港連續第二年在全球IPO籌資額排名首位。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2019年前五個月住宅物業市場出現強勁反彈，但全年後期則普遍趨於軟化。2019年初市場情緒有所改善，部分原因是美國與中國貿易緊張關係的擔憂暫時緩和，但隨後因貿易緊張關係再度升級、持續的社會事件以及國內經濟條件惡化，市場情緒受到打擊。整體住宅價格從5月到12月較高峰時期回落5%，但因前五個月出現10%的反彈，全年仍錄得5%的年增長（圖4）。2019年物業交易量較上年增加4%，達59,797單位，反映年初交易活動強勁。住宅負擔能力依然緊張，價格收入比和收入負擔比分別維持在17.9和80.9的高水平，遠高於長期平均值。為協助有即時住房需求的購房者，香港按揭貸款公司（HKMC）於10月中旬提高了抵押貸款計劃下可貸款的完工住宅物業價值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面臨更強的下行壓力。特別是零售場地的價格和租金出現自2008年全球金融危機以來的最大跌幅，反映當年營商環境持續惡化。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2020年的經濟表現預期將非常艱難，與新型冠狀病毒爆發所帶來的近期下行風險密切相關。一些尚未從社會事件所造成的干擾中復原的行業，例如零售、住宿、餐飲服務、旅遊及運輸業，將面臨雙重打擊。然而，2020\/21財政年度預算中宣布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金發放及在「特別信貸融資計劃」（SFGS）下提供100%政府擔保的新低息貸款優惠，預期將為經濟，特別是家庭及中小企業提供一定支持。2020年3月16日，香港金融管理局進一步將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率從2.0%降至1.0%，這將使銀行更能支持本地經濟，特別是那些預期因新型冠狀病毒爆發影響而面臨額外短期壓力的行業及個人。從GDP組成部分來看，私人消費及投資預期將因消費者及企業信心脆弱而持續疲弱。雖然政府消費將推動經濟增長，但公共投資支出預期在一些重大基礎設施項目完成後將相對緩慢。在外圍方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議在短時間內對本地經濟評估為略為正面。然而，香港的外貿表現仍將受到全球經濟增長乏力及貿易流動疲軟的拖累。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區域供應鏈中斷及跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，從而限制香港的出口。政府預計2020年實際GDP增長將介於-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際機構及私人分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n\n2020年通貨膨脹壓力預期將因經濟條件不佳、私人住宅租賃市場的整固以及輕微的進口通脹而趨緩。市場共識預測2020年的 headline 通貨膨脹率為1.8%，政府預測 headline 通貨膨脹率與核心通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%與2.5%。在勞動市場方面，考慮到經濟前景疲軟及冠狀病毒疫情爆發，近期内失業率可能進一步上升。私人部門分析師預期2020年的失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年的經濟展望相對保守，面臨許多不確定性和風險，包括來自全球經濟減速、中美貿易關係、內地經濟表現、地方社會事件以及新型冠狀病毒疫情持續爆發等因素。特別是，新型冠狀病毒疫情若持續延長，可能引發更明顯的全球經濟減速，並導致資產重新定價，進而造成不利的宏觀經濟環境與更為緊縮的金融條件，進一步對國內實體經濟活動造成下行壓力。然而，主要央行更為積極的貨幣政策紓困措施，可能緩衝疫情對經濟造成的負面影響。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n2019年，香港銀行業在面對全球經濟放緩、美國與中國貿易緊張關係以及本地社會事件等挑戰的環境下，表現依然堅韌。銀行業的資產負債表趨勢穩定，貸款及存款均以溫和速度增長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況依然穩固，資產質素亦維持良好。銀行業持續保持盈利，平均資產回報率穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n2019年，香港貨幣兌換率及資金市場運作順暢有序。全年香港貨幣兌換率維持穩定，並在年底進一步強勢於可兌換範圍的強方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其對衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。所謂貨幣穩定，是指香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎必須至少由匯基金所持有的美元儲備完全支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n債務憑證，其為三間發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供完全擔保\n\n流通中的政府發行紙幣及硬幣的總結餘額，即銀行在香港金融管理局結算帳戶的結餘總和\n\n由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發票及紙幣（EFBNs）\n\n香港貨幣兌換率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾來維持的。當對港元的需求大於供應，市場兌換率上揚至強方兌換水平 HK$7.75 至 1 美元時，HKMA 會根據銀行的要求，準備出售港元以換取美元。此時總結餘將擴張，推動港元利率下降，創造出使港元兌換率離開強方上限、並維持在 7.75 至 7.85 的可兌換範圍內的貨幣條件。反之，若港元供應大於需求，市場兌換率下跌至弱方兌換水平 HK$7.85 至 1 美元時，HKMA 會根據銀行的要求，準備購買港元。此時總結餘將收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元兌換率離開弱方上限，並維持在可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定性\n\n儘管面對外部環境的不確定性及國內經濟放緩，2019年香港貨幣仍維持穩定，並以平穩有序的方式進行交易。年初時，港元與美元的負利率差距擴大，吸引市場進行賣港元買美元的套利交易，使港元兌美元匯率向弱方兌換保證金（CU）7.85靠攏（圖1）。隨著港元兌美元匯率持續走弱，3月時弱方兌換保證金機制共觸發八次。其後，港元持續維持在弱方兌換保證金水平7.85附近。自5月下旬起，因規模龐大的首次公開發行（IPO）活動、企業對股息支付的需求以及半年結算，促使港元走強。雖然在半年結算後港元一度回落，但自10月下旬起，港元重新獲得動力，並在年底時維持在可兌換範圍（Convertibility Zone）的強方水平。這一方面反映與資本市場相關的需求，包括IPO活動，另一方面則反映因年底流動性收緊而市場對港元的空頭部位進行結清。整體而言，2019年港元兌美元匯市運作正常。\n\n由於弱邊際結算銀行（CU）的啟動，總結算餘額（未經貼現窗口）及未償還的發行基金債券（EFBNs）由2018年底的1,136.2億港元減少至2019年底的1,133.0億港元（圖2）。當年，香港金融管理局根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，應銀行的要求，在弱邊際結算銀行利率7.85%的水平下，購入總計221億港元的債券，導致總結算餘額（未經貼現窗口）由2018年底的76.4億港元減少至2019年底的54.3億港元。當年未償還的發行基金債券（EFBNs）略有上升，由1,0598億港元增至1,0787億港元，反映根據既定慣例發行EFBNs以吸收EFBNs的利息支付。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。2019年底總結算餘額（未經貼現窗口）及未償還發行基金債券和發票為1,133億港元。\n\n# 財務市場\n\n2019年期間，香港美元銀行間利率在較長端維持大致穩定，而短端利率則普遍上揚（圖3）。短端利率亦因與首次公開發行（IPO）相關的融資需求及季節性流動性需求而出現更多波動。自2018年4月以來，總結餘減少，可能使香港美元銀行間利率對本地市場港元融資供需變動的敏感度提高。\n\n2018年底的基準利率為2.75%，其後於2018年8月1日、9月19日及10月31日分別調降，總計調降75個基點，降至2018年11月初的2.00%。此期間美國聯邦基金目標利率範圍共調降三次，總計75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。2018年11月18日至26日以及12月19日至31日期間，基準利率高於2.00%，反映當年最後兩個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的 overnight 及一個月期利率出現顯著上漲趨勢。因此，2019年底基準利率收市為2.49%。基準利率的調整是根據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式進行的，該公式規定基準利率為美國聯邦基金目標利率當前範圍的下限之上50個基點，或為過往五日的overnight 及一個月期HIBOR的移動平均數的平均值，取較高者。在零售金融方面，多家零售銀行在10月下旬美國聯邦基金目標利率範圍調降後，將其最佳貸款利率調低了12.5個基點。\n\n港元期貨點差在前兩個月擴大，大致跟隨港元對美元息差的波動，其中12個月期港元期貨點差在2月上旬達到約-708點（圖4）。其後，隨著港元對美元息差的負值收窄，港元期貨點差亦逐漸收窄，並在年底轉為 premiums（ premium 指 premium，即升水）。整體而言，香港的資金市場運作有序。2019年，貼現窗口貸款減少至383億港元，較2018年的402億港元有所下降。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n貨幣發行局（LERS）在過去三十多年來對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了重大貢獻，並在多項區域及全球金融危機中展現出強韌性。面對當年社會事件的發生，一些無根據的謠言在社交媒體上流傳，質疑貨幣發行局及香港的金融穩定。香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速且積極地反駁這些謠言，並透過傳統及社交媒體向公眾發出澄清，重申貨幣發行局將繼續維持現行制度，香港不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，香港金融管理局亦發佈多篇文章，協助公眾了解貨幣發行局的運作、資金流動情況及利率展望。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對貨幣發行局的信心，從全年市場有序運作可見一斑。政府亦堅定支持貨幣發行局。公眾對政府承諾及港元作為支付手段和價值儲存工具的信心，亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步加強。在2019年對香港的第四條審查（Article IV consultation）中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）重申其長期支持貨幣發行局作為香港金融穩定的基石，並指出貨幣發行局仍是香港適當的匯率安排，這項安排由香港透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系以及謹慎的財政框架所支撐。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系高度流動且穩健，流動性水平及資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業貸款、與物業相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管工作。與往年相比，銀行的總結餘較為低，但銀行普遍加強了流動性管理安排，並在日常資金安排方面更加積極主動。此外，香港金融管理局亦持續與銀行保持緊密溝通，以確保市場流動性順利循環，尤其是在大型首次公開發行（IPO）認購期前後及認購期間。本年度未出現結算癱瘓的情況，貼現窗口繼續有效且高效運作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中劃出特定部分，用以支持貨幣基礎。2019年，後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在109.9%至112.1%之間，未觸及上、下觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收市為111.2%（圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），雖然已指定特定發行基金資產用作後備組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在面對突發性衝擊時，發行基金龐大的財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行局諮詢委員會的貨幣發行局小組委員會（CBC）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2019年，CBC 考慮了多項議題，包括對貨幣發行安排（LERS）的事件研究、香港整體結餘與利率之間的關係、對貨幣發行安排的選擇權市場觀點採取更為完善及靈活的處理方式，以及未來首次公開發行（IPO）對港元銀行同业拆息（HIBOR）的影響。CBC 對這些議題的討論記錄及提交給 CBC 的貨幣發行局運作報告，均會在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究學院（HKIMR，前稱香港貨幣研究學院）從事與政策相關的貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域的研究。這一點體現在HKIMR研究人員及海外訪問學者所探討的廣泛主題，以及該機構舉辦的會議和活動中。HKIMR與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為重點的會議。其研究訪問計劃支持與香港金融管理局（HKMA）、香港及地區息息相關的政策議題的研究項目。\n\n2019年，香港國際貨幣研究所共接待14位研究學者，發表17篇工作論文，並舉辦11場公開研討會，主題涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融等廣泛範疇。該研究所亦舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n第十屆國際中國經濟學術研討會，主題為「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由香港國際金融研究中心、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心財政研究所聯合主辦。該會議為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家提供了一個世界級的論壇，討論在金融改革及大陸經濟發展所引發的變化背景下，大陸金融部門所面臨的風險問題。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2019年保持穩健及穩定，儘管面對全球及本地經濟疲軟所帶來的挑戰。多虧行業各方的協同努力，銀行業在社會事件期間仍能正常運作。有關方面亦採取措施，以將對公眾造成的不便減至最低程度。當年，香港金融管理局（金管局）重點監察獲授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理。考慮到網絡威脅不斷升級，以及行業對科技的依賴日益增加，金管局亦加強對獲授權機構科技風險管理的監察。在行為監管方面，金管局簡化投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。我們亦加強對數字金融服務的消費者保護，並持續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組（FATF）對香港AML\/CFT制度的第四輪相互評估工作圓滿完成，評估結果認為香港的AML\/CFT制度整體符合標準且有效，特別對銀行業對風險的良好理解以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）在AML\/CFT領域以風險為基礎的監管工作給予正面評價。香港金融管理局持續參與針對詐騙及洗錢情報共享的公私合作計劃，並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，香港金融管理局於2019年向八間虛擬銀行發出銀行牌照，並宣布採取三階段方式，以促進香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監管政策及程序，並推行能力建設計劃，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，本地落實國際監管標準方面亦取得重大進展，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額 exposures 標準。香港金融管理局亦持續進行工作，確保獲授權機構將有可信的解決機制，包括實施有關吸收虧損能力的要求規則，以提高獲授權機構的可解決性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於金融體系具備高度的韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，可能影響整個系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，更可能以混亂的方式導致失敗。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力、並能在危機中恢復其地位，從而維護金融穩定方面，發揮關鍵作用，最終協助防止失敗的發生。貨幣管理局負責監管香港的銀行的審慎監管。其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構合稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。貨幣管理局亦負責某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監督。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保，亦無香港審慎監管架構設計用以確保，一個零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為解決機構，旨在確保在人工智能機構（AI）變得不可持續運作時，其失敗情況可以有序處理。為此，香港已建立一套金融機構解決機制，其中貨幣管理局為人工智能機構的解決機構。為確保香港的解決機制有效運作，制定解決法律及政策標準、進行解決計劃以消除對人工智能機構可解決性的阻礙，以及提升貨幣管理局處理失敗人工智能機構的運作能力，至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，貨幣管理局採用國際上協調一致的處理方式。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2019年，共進行了196次現場外審，覆蓋範圍廣泛，包括資本充足率評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略等議題。為持續推動強化風險治理，香港金融管理局（HKMA）與32家持牌機構（AIs）的董事會或董事層委員會舉行了26次會面。此外，香港金融管理局、持牌機構及其外部核數師亦舉行了32次三方會議。\n\n除離場活動外，香港金融管理局亦定期進行現場檢查，並配合針對高風險領域的主題審查。本年度共進行了405次現場檢查及主題審查。信用風險管理一直是這些檢查及審查的重點。另一個主要關注領域是科技風險及運作風險管理。香港金融管理局同時亦增加針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及實施巴塞爾資本充足框架的現場檢查及主題審查次數。同時，專門團隊亦對持牌機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行現場檢查及主題審查。\n\n表1總結了香港金融管理局2019年的監管活動。\n\n# 信用風險管理\n\n# 貸款成長與資產品質\n\n2019年銀行貸款增幅溫和。總貸款額較上年增長6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所提高。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款及用於香港以外地區的貸款分別增長7.7%及5.8%。\n\n與內地相關的貸款在2019年底增至港幣4,564億億元，按年增長7.4%（見表3）。\n\nAI 的資產質素維持健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年底的0.51%微降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年起的長期歷史平均水平2%。就整個銀行業而言，分類貸款比率則微升至0.57%，從0.55%。就與內地相關的貸款而言，零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，但仍低於歷史標準。就整個銀行業而言，比率較去年同期的0.55%上升至0.75%。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了監管努力，確保信貸機構在不確定的經濟環境下持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。壓力測試已加以強化，以涵蓋更全面的風險範疇及採用更嚴峻的壓力假設。強化後的壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行通常擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端衝擊。HKMA亦進行針對性及主題性審查，評估信貸機構在不同領域的信貸風險管理實務，例如對從事高風險業務的企業的貸款、複雜融資安排，以及對私人銀行及資產管理客戶的擔保貸款。鑑於中小企業（SMEs）在經濟下行期間較容易面臨更大挑戰，HKMA於十月設立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，旨在鼓勵銀行在謹慎風險管理原則所允許的範圍內，持續支持中小企業的融資需求。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）推行了八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，顯著增強了香港銀行業對物業市場下行的抗風險能力。在首次推出逆周期措施之前，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）從2009年9月的64%降至2019年12月的53%。同時，新按揭貸款的平均還款比率（DSR）亦從2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%降至2019年12月的36%（圖1）。\n\n# 操作與科技風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）採用三階段方式推行「網絡安全強化計劃」（CFI）下的網絡韌性評估框架。第一階段評估涵蓋所有主要銀行，已于2018年完成。第二及第三階段所涉及的其他機構已按計劃 substantially 完成評估。此外，HKMA亦已展開對CFI的全面檢討，以根據過去幾年的經驗對該計劃進行優化。\n\n十月，香港金融管理局發佈了有關「電子銀行風險管理」的監管政策手冊（SPM）修訂模組。此次修訂旨在為業界提供更大的靈活性，以應對客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。香港金融管理局亦發佈了一套有關人工智能應用的高層原則，以為業界提供指引。\n\n自六月社會事件開始以來，香港金融管理局一直與業界保持緊密溝通，監察對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）並盡快修復遭破壞的設施。香港金融管理局亦迅速行動，反駁旨在削弱公眾對銀行體系信心的惡意謠言。由於銀行業界協同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施已迅速恢復正常運作，並盡量減少了對公眾造成的不便。考慮到社會事件所帶來的營運風險不斷上升，銀行被要求採取額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理的監督\n\n本年度進行了一輪主題性審查，以評估銀行機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點包括銀行機構流動性壓力測試計劃的強健性及其應急資金管理情況。香港金融管理局亦評估銀行機構遵守有關流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）計算規則的合規情況，以確保用於計算的輸入數據的謹慎性及準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業日益流行，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了一輪主題審查，評估人工智能（AI）在該領域的風險管理實踐。考慮到倫敦銀行間拆借利率（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止發佈，HKMA提醒人工智能機構做好轉向替代參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查以監測其轉換準備情況。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐融資（ML\/TF）\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據風險為本的原則監督信貸機構的反洗錢\/反恐 financing（AML\/CFT）系統。本年度進行了18次現場審查及61次非現場審查，包括針對私人銀行及新科技應用治理的主題審查。香港金融管理局亦與業界分享從主題審查中所得的觀察結果及最佳實踐，以協助信貸機構採用適當的企業客戶開戶程序及相關服務。\n\n# 金融行動任務組（FATF）相互評估（ME）報告：香港\n\n2019年香港金融管理局（HKMA）及香港整體反洗錢\/反恐融資（AML\/CFT）制度的亮點之一，是於9月發表了金融行動特別小組（FATF）對香港的監測評估（ME）報告。該報告代表了FATF第四輪對其成員管轄區進行監測評估（ME）以來的最佳整體成績之一。香港在評估其AML\/CFT制度有效性時，於11項「即時成效」（Immediate Outcomes）中獲得6項「重大成效」（Substantial）評級，並在ME的技術合規方面取得高分。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局（HKMA）以風險為本的反洗錢\/反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管方法表示肯定，指出HKMA對銀行業的洗錢\/恐怖融資（ML\/TF）風險有良好的理解，對儲值支付工具（SVF）業的風險也有合理的認識。報告亦對銀行業界集體的AML\/CFT努力表示肯定，例如大型銀行機構增加使用數據分析技術、絕大多數可疑交易報告由銀行機構提交，以及業界積極參與詐騙及洗錢情報小組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議了幾個改進領域，包括對一些高風險領域的認識，例如外國貪腐及稅務犯罪，以及發展中的領域如特殊目的載體（SVFs）。有關這些建議的改善工作已經展開；香港金融管理局（HKMA）於七月發表了有關SVF行業的更新版洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估報告，並已開始針對私人銀行業及新科技應用的治理進行主題性現場審查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","zh":"# 資產管理\n\n2019年全球金融市場表現優於預期，因主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的影響超過了對全球增長放緩及中美貿易摩擦的擔憂。在全球股市在2018年第四季經歷大幅回調後出現反彈，同時主要政府債券收益率下降，債券價格上漲。在這樣有利的環境下，2019年貨幣基金取得2622億港元的投資收入，投資回報率達6.6%。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n香港發行基金的主要目標，如《發行基金條例》所訂明，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。該基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，協助香港維持其國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局（金管局）根據財政司司長（財司）的授權，在授權範圍內，須向財司負責發行基金的運用及投資管理。\n\n# 交換基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）為證券交易所基金設定了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保持資本不變；  \n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候皆完全由高度流動的美元計價資產所支持；  \n(c) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及  \n(d) 以(a)至(c)為前提，實現有助於維護基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標已全面考慮發行基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n\n廣義而言，發行基金有兩個主要組合：後備組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。後備組合（BP）持有高度流動的美元資產，以根據貨幣聯繫匯率制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合（IP）則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持其資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並在中長期提升回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以謹慎及逐步的方式，將部分發行基金（Exchange Fund）的投資分散至更多元化的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私人股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合（IP）持有，而私人股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長組合（LTGP）下投資的市場價值上限，則設為發行基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及與LTGP相關的發行基金未來基金及子公司 placements 的部分總和。\n\n於2007年成立的戰略投資組合，持有香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由政府為代表發行機構基金的戰略目的而購入。由於該組合的獨特性，其並未納入評估基金投資表現的範疇。\n\n# 與發行基金的安排\n\n發行基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的投資。利率通常與IP表現掛鉤，唯獨未來基金的利率與IP及LTGP掛鉤，並根據投資組合的組成情況而定。截至2019年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券交易所基金的投資過程是以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：戰略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資指標中，代表根據證券交易所基金的投資目標所進行的長期資產配置。在戰略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以期取得高於指標的投資報酬。這意味著實際的資產配置往往與指標（或戰略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與指標配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然指標及追蹤誤差上限是由財政司與證券及期貨事務監察委員會協商後確定，但戰術性決策及戰術性偏離的允許範圍則由香港金融管理局根據授權作出決定。在戰術性偏離允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可根據短期市場走勢進行投資。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局於2018年8月設立發行基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以統籌其投資及相關風險管理功能。EFIO的職員直接管理發行基金約71%的投資，包括全部的_BP_及部分的_IP_。該部分的_IP_包含一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多種衍生工具對沖組合，用以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外部管理機構的使用\n\n除內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦委任外部基金管理機構管理約29%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部管理機構的目的是借助市場上最優秀的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的投資回報，吸收多樣化且互補的投資風格，並獲取其市場見解及投資技術專長。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易費用以及扣繳及其他稅費。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外部管理的投資組合，均已設有嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監督其對指引及規則的遵守情況。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估亦已加強，以支持發行基金投資組合的多元化程度提升。風險控制工具被用來評估在正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險。同時亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，使香港金融管理局能評估如何最有效地運用內部及外部管理機構的投資技能。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素納入交易所基金在公眾及私人市場投資的投資過程中，以推動負責任投資（RI）。\n\n在公眾市場投資方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）實施與程序相關及與投資相關的措施。香港金融管理局所採取的一項與程序相關的措施，是採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《負責任擁有原則》（PRo），協助投資者了解如何在投資香港上市公司的過程中，最恰當地履行其所有權責任。在管理貨幣發行保證基金的過程中，香港金融管理局已制定內部指引，涵蓋與環境、社會及企業治理（ESG）因素相關的選聘、任命及監督外部基金管理人的程序。香港金融管理局所委任的外部基金管理人，就管理其在香港股市及內地活躍股市組合的投資而言，須根據「符合原則或作出說明」的原則遵守PRo；而委任管理香港金融管理局在成熟市場股市組合的外部基金管理人，則須遵守國際認可的ESG標準。除了外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦已納入香港金融管理局內部管理的債券投資信用風險分析中。\n\n有關在香港公開市場的ESG投資，香港金融管理局自2015年起已作為此市場的早期投資者之一，投資於綠色債券，並參與由國際金融公司主辦的「管理共同貸款組合計劃」，專注於在新興市場進行可持續投資。展望未來，香港金融管理局將透過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金，持續擴大其綠色債券投資組合。此外，香港金融管理局亦計劃在股權投資方面構建ESG主題的投資策略，採用ESG股權指數作為被動投資組合的參考指標，並與應用ESG因素於投資決策中的主動股權管理人合作。\n\n針對私人市場投資，香港金融管理局（HKMA）會在盡職調查過程中審視普通合伙人（General Partners）的環境、社會及治理（ESG）政策與實踐。特別是在所有長期普通合伙人（LTGP）投資中，ESG風險評估已被納入盡職調查的必備環節。對於LTGP，HKMA投資具可持續特徵的項目；例如，自2013年起，HKMA已在能源領域進行直接及共同投資，投資可再生能源，並在其房地產組合中投資具綠色及可持續特徵的綠色建築及倉庫。展望未來，HKMA將持續尋找具可持續特徵的項目，並將綠色認證作為房地產投資的主要考量因素。\n\n香港金融管理局會密切關注環境、社會及治理（ESG）標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入其投資過程。此過程有賴於其與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。特別是，作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則（PRI）簽署機構，而PRI是全球最具代表性的責任投資倡導機構，香港金融管理局預期將參與制定ESG最佳實踐標準，並鼓勵其他投資者採用責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦為FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織為非營利機構，透過研討會及研究項目，致力於促進企業及投資決策中更長遠的觀點。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為與氣候相關財務披露任務組（TCFD）的支持機構。\n\n如需了解更多關於香港金融管理局的RI政策框架詳情，請參閱「企業社會責任」章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2019年金融市場\n\n儘管有對全球經濟成長放緩與中美貿易緊張關係的擔憂，2019年在全球主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的支持下，全球金融市場表現良好。在2018年第四季經歷顯著回調後，全球股市於2019年大幅回升。在債券市場方面，由於貨幣政策寬鬆，2019年前三個季度主要國債收益率明顯下降，債券價格上漲。儘管第四季收益率略有回升，債券價格出現回調，但整體而言，2019年債券市場的表現仍屬滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場上，主要貨幣對美元表現不一。由於中美貿易緊張局勢升級，人民幣在第三季度下跌了3.8%，但在第四季度因貿易緊張局勢有所緩和，人民幣恢復了部分此前的跌幅。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。而在第三季度，由於無協議脫離歐盟的風險升高，英鎊下跌了3.2%，但隨著第四季度對脫離歐盟的資訊更加明確，英鎊隨後大幅反彈，最終對美元升值了4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n2019年，發行機構錄得投資收入高達2622億港元。其中包括債券增值2145億港元、香港股票增值221億港元、其他股票增值1007億港元、非港元資產的負面匯率影響為130億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資產生的增值379億港元。另外，戰略投資組合錄得評價增值250億港元。\n\n證券及期貨事務監察委員會的總資產在財政年度結算時達到4,2067億港元。在長期投資計劃（LTGP）下的投資總市值為3351億港元，其中私人股權為2334億港元，不動產為1017億港元。未償還的投資承諾達2193億港元。\n\n2019年交易所基金（不計戰略投資組合）的投資回報率為6.6%。具體而言，IP的回報率為9.7%，而BP則獲利2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率已達12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n","zh":"# 交易所基金\n\n- 审計總監報告\n- 貨幣發行局財務報表\n\n# 稽核長報告\n\n# 獨立會計師報告 給財政司司長\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）於第187至293頁所載之財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及集團於2019年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收入支出表、綜合損益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公平地反映該基金及集團於2019年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該財務狀況在該會計年度內的財務表現及現金流，並符合香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）的規定，而該準則由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈。財務報表亦已按照根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條由行政長官作出的指示適當編製。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據《發鈔基金條例》第7條所頒佈的行政長官指示及審計委員會的審計準則進行審計。我根據這些準則所負有的責任已在我的報告中「財務報表審計的審計師責任」一節中進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立於集團，並已按照這些準則履行其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 重要審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指在吾專業判斷下，於審計2019年12月31日結賬年度財務報表時具有最重大意義的事項。這些事項係在審計財務報表整體過程中處理，並在形成吾意見時予以考慮，吾並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債的公允價值計量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為港幣3,874,223億元，金融負債總額為港幣1,158,686億元，並按公允價值計價。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 91% 以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值均以活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1 輸入）為基礎，或以基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術進行估算（Level 2 輸入）。\n\n對於這些金融資產中餘下的9%，其公允價值是透過使用不以可觀察市場數據為基礎的輸入資料（第三層輸入資料）的評估技術進行估算。這些金融資產總計為338,758億港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n由於涉及金額龐大且包含許多估計，以公允價值計價金融資產及金融負債為一項重要審計事項。\n\n有關以公允價值計價的金融資產及金融負債的評估程序包括：\n\n了解用以評價不同類別金融資產及金融負債之程序，包括相關控制措施；\n\n評估及測試控制措施，包括相關的電腦系統應用控制。\n\n取得有關財務資產及財務負債之評價、存在、權利與義務及完整性之外部確認；\n\n引用市價時，應核對獨立來源以確認價格；\n\n使用基於可觀察市場資料的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並驗證輸入資料是否來自獨立來源；以及\n\n於使用非基於可觀察市場資料之輸入值評估技術時，評估評估方法之適當性及假設與輸入值之合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產以公允價值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業以公允價值計入，截至2019年12月31日，總額為港幣224.81億元。集團亦持有二十二個合資企業的權益，總額為港幣445.06億元，這些合資企業的主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有或由合資企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的評估確定。有關估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所採用的估值方法及假設。\n\n針對以公允價值計量的投資性不動產的評估程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱集團直接或透過合資企業持有的投資物業的評估報告，並確認公允價值是根據評估報告中所載的評估結果確定的。\n\n評估評估師的獨立性及資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適當性以及假設與輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港貨幣管理局2019年年度報告內的所有資料，惟不包括財務報表及我的會計師就該財務報表所作出的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不包括其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時考慮該其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中所獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否明顯存在重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此情況。就本項事宜，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 財政司司長及發鈔銀行諮詢委員會審計小組委員會就財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）及根據《發行基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，編製提供真實、公允視角的財務報表，並負責貨幣管理局認為為確保財務報表無重大誤導（無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致）而必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局有責任評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並以持續經營為基礎進行會計處理。\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會負責監督集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 會計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確認整體財務報表在重大錯誤或舞弊的情況下是否不存在重大不正確，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不代表根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總能發現已存在的重大不正確。不正確可能源自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合計起來，可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計的過程中，我秉持專業判斷並貫徹專業懷疑態度。我也：\n\n辨識並評估財務報表中重大錯誤的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能發現因詐欺所致的重大錯誤的風險，高於因錯誤所致的重大錯誤，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制的情況。\n\n以了解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計適當的審計程序，但並非用以就集團內部控制的成效發表意見。\n\n評估貨幣當局所採用會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n\n評估貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎會計的適當性，並根據所獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存在重大不確定性，該不確定性與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況有關。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我有責任在審計報告中提請關注財務報表中的相關披露，若相關披露不充分，則應修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我出具審計報告日期所獲取的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營的實體。\n\n評估財務報表整體的呈現、結構及內容，包括相關揭露，並確認財務報表是否以達成公平呈現的方式，反映背後的交易及事件；並取得足夠適當的審計證據，以就集團內各個實體或業務活動的財務資訊表達意見。我負責集團審計的指導、監督及執行。我對我的審計意見負全責。\n\n我與發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會就審計的預計範圍及時間安排以及重大審計發現等事項進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中所識別出的重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與發行機構顧問委員會審計小組所溝通的事項，我已評估出對本期財務報表審計而言最具重要性的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或規則禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極少數情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果將合理地超過披露該事項對公共利益的效益，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n朱振華\n稽核部經理\n\n審計委員會  \n26樓  \n移民大樓  \n Gloucester Road 7號  \n灣仔，香港\n\n2020年4月3日\n"}
