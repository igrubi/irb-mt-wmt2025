{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n2015年香港經濟增長放緩，反映內地需求疲弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長仍將疲軟，面對嚴峻的外部環境及不穩定的金融市場情況。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 總覽\n\n香港的經濟增長在本年有所放緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長放慢至2014年的2.6%的2.4%（見表1）。這反映內在需求擴張較為溫和，不過淨出口再度成為GDP增長的正面因素，因總進口下降速度高於總出口（見圖1）。儘管經濟表現相對平穩，勞動市場則大致維持穩定，失業率維持在較低水平，約為3.3%。通脹進一步緩和，這是因國內成本及進口價格壓力有所減退所致。受全球金融市場波動加劇影響，本地股市出現大幅波動。在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始趨於軟化，並在年底顯示出進一步 consolidate 的跡象。\n\n圖表 1 實際 GDP 增長的貢獻情況  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出項目計算的實質GDP成長率（期別對期別）\n\n注意：經季節調整的季度固定資本形成總額變動率資料不可用。  \n來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年香港貨幣兌美元匯率維持穩定，維持在約7.75水平。由於與股票相關的資金流入，4月觸發了強方維護貨幣兌換保證措施；9月及10月則因離岸人民幣兌換為港元及部分商業對港元的需求而再次觸發。隨著總結餘額擴大，本地利率持續維持在低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率則在12月中美國利率調升後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩，由2014年的12.7%減至2015年的3.5%。銀行業整體貸款質素略有惡化，但貸款分類比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 國內需求\n\n2015年國內需求成長速度放緩。儘管就業與收入情況整體穩定，持續支撐經濟，但消費者信心疲軟以及資產價格修正，對下半年私人消費成長造成壓力。然而，由於上半年成長動能較強，全年私人消費成長率從2014年的3.3%提高至4.8%。政府消費則略微加快，成長率為3.4%。事實上，國內需求成長放緩，主要是因為固定資本形成總額下降了2.2%（圖2）。私人部門機械與設備採購連續第二年出現下滑，因商業情緒惡化，同時建築與建設活動也顯示出較弱的成長動能，與公共建設進度放緩同步。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港2015年的出口表現惡化（圖3）。商品出口出現廣泛下跌，跌幅達1.7%，這是自2009年以來首次出現跌幅。出口至日本和歐盟的表現下滑，而出口至美國則僅有微幅增長。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求，亦對區域內工業活動及區域內貿易造成壓力。因此，香港對內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體的中間及最終需求疲弱而下降。香港服務貿易出口持續從過去幾年的高增長路線放緩，2015年更出現0.6%的跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊活動放緩所致。商品進口亦因國內及出口引致需求疲弱而回落。相對而言，服務貿易進口的增長則因本地居民旅遊意願強勁而加快。整體而言，2015年香港的總貿易順差略有改善，對GDP增長作出輕微正面貢獻。\n\n圖2 國內需求  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n2015年，潛在通脹進一步緩和，這是因為國內成本壓力有所減輕，進口價格通脹也下降。扣除政府一次性纾困措施的影響後，潛在通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖4）。經濟活動低迷，勞動成本壓力維持穩定，而商業及工業租賃成本壓力則有所緩和，尤其在第二季後更為明顯。得益於全球商品價格回落及港元走強，進口價格壓力減輕，食品通脹亦維持低水平。由於早前季度的新租賃房屋租金傳導效應較為溫和，因此通脹中的租賃成分仍受控。\n\n圖3 商品及服務出口額\n資料來源：統計處\n\n圖4 隱含消費者物價通貨膨脹  \n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 就業市場\n\n2015年勞動市場情況保持穩定。就業需求維持不變，雖然貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業人數減少，但其他行業的招聘速度穩定，因而總體就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。同時，勞動供給也增加1.3%，季節性調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%的水平（圖表5）。考慮到勞動市場仍然緊張，今年前三個季度名義工資上漲4.7%，較2014年的4.3%有所提高。隨著通脹壓力緩和，實際工資在前三個季度增長1.3%，與2014年出現0.1%的下降形成對比。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市因外部環境的重大變化，經歷了一個波動的年份。在首季表現平穩後，受內地A股市場看漲情緒及資金流入的推動，本地股市在第二季表現強勁。4月恆生指數升至七年高位，同時自2014年11月啟動以來，首次出現港股通南向每日額度用盡的情況（圖6）。然而，自6月下旬起，本地市場轉趨下跌，受內地A股市場及全球股市拋售、全球外匯市場波動加劇以及國際商品價格走弱的影響，恆生指數在9月下跌28%，創下一年來的低點。隨著全球及內地金融市場逐步穩定，本地股市在第四季有所回復。整體而言，2015年恆生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而平均每日成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。雖然第二季資金集資活動有所減緩，但來自本地股市的整體權益資金仍由一年前的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整固跡象。在2015年初經歷了一段熱絡時期後，隨着二月第七輪審慎措施的公布，住宅物業市場隨後有所軟化。在去年第四季住房價格上漲速度放緩並出現下跌的情況下，2015年整體住房價格累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%增幅（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期減少12.3%，至55,982單位，因第二季後半段次級市場交易活動明顯減少。投機性交易，包括確認交易及短線倒賣交易，持續維持在低水平。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力依然吃緊，價格收入比率達到15.7，收入負擔比率遠高於長期平均水平。商業及工業物業市場在上半年表現強勁，但隨後交易活動放緩，至去年第四季價格及租金均出現下跌。租金回報率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低水平附近。\n\n圖表 6 資產價格  \n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易所有限公司\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2016年香港經濟增長預期將持續疲軟。私人機構分析師預測經濟將以較慢的平均增長率1.7%擴張，而政府則預期增長幅度在1至2%之間。更具體而言，疲弱的全球增長前景、持續低迷的入境旅遊以及全球金融市場波動所帶來的負面影響，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。在國內方面，私人消費預期將溫和增長，因經濟動能較弱，勞動市場情況可能面臨一定壓力，而本地資產價格調整或會影響消費信心，並引發負面財富效應。建築及建設活動或可維持穩定，但企業信心疲弱及利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n\n2016年通貨膨脹壓力預期將持續受到控制。進口價格壓力將維持緩和，而在經濟成長動能溫和的情況下，國內成本壓力預期將保持溫和。由於2015年底新租賃住宅租金壓力減緩，通貨膨脹中的租金成分也可能趨緩。市場共識預測2016年 headline 通貨膨脹率為2.5%，而政府預測基礎通貨膨脹率為2.0%。此外，由於入境旅遊減緩以及出口部門持續低迷，勞動市場也可能略微放緩。私人部門分析師目前預期2016年失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2016年的經濟前景面臨多方面的不確定性和風險。特別是美國利率進一步上升的步調、全球經濟增長前景以及商品價格走勢，仍將是主要的不確定因素。任何重大不利的發展都可能增加全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動性，從而 tighten（緊縮）國內貨幣與金融條件，並對香港的增長前景造成陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將在很大程度上取決於它們透過財富效應和資產負債表效應對房地產業的影響。雖然房地產業正面臨來自全球及本地金融市場情緒走弱、美國利率正常化以及住宅需求與供應缺口收窄等方面的下行風險，但尚需更多時間才能確定房地產業是否已進入下行週期。儘管房地產業的劇烈調整可能對整體經濟造成重大阻力，但過去幾年所推行的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已顯著增強了香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在本年度仍表現堅韌，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策出現進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體的潛在風險不斷積累。獲授權機構（AIs）的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的AIs資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略有惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n配合美元利率，整年香港美元銀行間利率均偏低。零售銀行的港元資金成本在上半年因綜合利率呈現下降趨勢而有所回落，並在下半年維持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖7 香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）固定利率、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）  \n說明：  \n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）固定利率係指由香港銀行協會發佈的港元利息結算利率，為月度平均數。\n\n2.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n2015年，香港貨幣兌換率在面對金融市場波動及12月美國利率上調的情況下，整體維持大致穩定。貨幣市場亦持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。作為香港過去數十年維持貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度持續表現出高度的抗風險能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。所謂貨幣穩定，是指香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在 HK$7.75 至 HK$7.85 與 1 美元之間的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎必須至少由匯基金所持有的美元儲備完全支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括\n\n* 債券憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全面擔保  \n* 由政府發行並流通的紙幣及硬幣  \n* 總結餘額，即銀行在香港金融管理局開設的結算帳戶結餘總和  \n* 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發鈔券及紙幣\n\n香港貨幣兌換率的穩定是由自動利率調節機制以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾所維持。當對港元的需求大於供應，市場兌換率上揚至強方兌換水平 HK$7.75 至 1 美元時，HKMA 會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此時總結餘將擴張，推動港元利率下降，創造出使港元兌換率離開強方上限、並維持在 7.75 至 7.85 的可兌換範圍內的貨幣條件。反之，若港元供應大於需求，市場兌換率下跌至弱方兌換水平 HK$7.85 至 1 美元時，HKMA 會從銀行購入港元。此時總結餘將收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元兌換率離開弱方上限，並維持在可兌換範圍內。\n\nherein 所列的債券及流通中的政府發行貨幣紙幣和硬幣，均以港元面值列示。本年度報告中交換基金資產負債表所顯示的相應項目，則以港元計值，其數額相當於在資產負債表日期所採用的匯率下，用以贖回這些證券所需的美元金額。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\nherein 所顯示的 EFBN 金額與本年度報告中發行基金的資產負債表所載的 EFBN 金額有所不同。根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表發行基金在二級市場交易 EFBN 所持有的 EFBN，會與所發行的 EFBN 相抵銷，並以淨額列示於資產負債表內。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定\n\n2015年，港元兌美元匯率大致維持穩定，交易範圍窄幅波動於7.7500至7.7657之間（圖表1）。年初時，市場對美國加息的擔憂導致港元面對輕微的貶值壓力。然而，第二季港元兌美元匯率上漲至接近7.75，4月期間因港股活動熱絡，港股相關需求增加，導致強方維護機制（CU）多次觸發。進入年下半年，儘管港股及內地股市出現顯著沽售，以及全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動增加，港元兌美元匯率仍維持在接近7.75的水平。受離岸人民幣兌換成港元的影響，9月及10月期間強方維護機制再次觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25個基點，但港元兌美元匯率仍維持在窄幅範圍內波動，未出現顯著的資金流出壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場波動劇烈，2015年港元兌美元匯市運作有序。\n\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於4月、9月及10月強方發售的貨幣結算憑證（CU）屢次發行，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據貨幣發行局制度，以總計港幣2272億元向銀行換取美國美元293億元，導致貨幣基礎總額相應擴張。部分擴張幅度因應銀行對流動性管理的強烈需求，透過發行更多發行基金紙幣而得到抵銷（圖2）。發行更多發行基金紙幣與貨幣發行局制度一致，因為這代表貨幣基礎組成的變化，而貨幣基礎完全由外匯儲備支持。至2015年底，貨幣基礎總額與發行基金紙幣及紙幣的未償還總額由年初的港幣9925億元增至港幣12210億元。\n\n圖2 2015年總結餘額及發行基金紙幣餘額\n\n# 財務市場\n\n銀行體系內流動性充足，香港銀行同業拆息在2015年整體維持在低水平。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）自0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%，根據預設公式，香港銀行同業結算利率亦於12月17日自0.5%上調至0.75%。2015年整體而言，由隔夜至三個月期的銀行同業拆息均低於結算利率（圖3），其波動主要由銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場波動情況下流動性收緊所帶動。香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）之間的利差大致趨勢，反映香港美元期貨點數於8月因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著 premiums，隨後因美國美元利率廣泛上調，於年底轉為 discounts（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常運作，貼現窗口貸款活動不顯著，2015年僅有約28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖3 2015年香港美元銀行間拆息率\n\n圖4 2015年港元期貨點數\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年中對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了重大貢獻。考慮到香港經濟規模小而開放，並作為國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定承諾維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，市民對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存工具的信心持續強勁。在2015年對香港的第四條審查（Article IV consultation）中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續支持聯繫匯率制度為香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港強健的制度、法律及政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及穩健的金融體系是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業貸款的監管工作，以提升銀行業的抗風險能力。面對美國利率上升的情況，香港金融管理局提醒公眾應做好風險管理的必要準備，並指出觸發弱方保證金及港元流出，是港元利率正常化的自然且必要的過程。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從貨幣發行基金資產中劃出特定部分，用以支持貨幣基礎。2015年，後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3至107.5%之間窄幅波動，未觸及上、下觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收市為106.3%（圖5）。根據貨幣發行局條例（LERS），雖然已指定特定貨幣發行基金資產用作後備組合，但所有貨幣發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財政資源在面對突發性衝擊時，可提供強大的後盾，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n圖5 2015年Backing Ratio每日波動情況\n\n# 其他活動\n\n證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）發行基金顧問委員會（EFAC）貨幣發行局小組委員會監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，該小組委員會考慮了包括全球銀行提供國際美元貸款的供應、國際間宏觀審慎措施的應用、美國利率上升對香港樓市的影響、基本利率的釐定公式、港元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險等議題。小組委員會的討論記錄及提交給該小組委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均會在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）持續贊助有關貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。2015年，該學院接待了16位研究 fellows，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議與研討會，主要的包括：\n\n* 一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟會議，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。會議中共有11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸泡沫與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等廣泛議題。  \n* 五月舉行的香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦的「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、制度與經濟增長會議」，探討多項經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管制度設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。  \n* 十月由香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦儲備理事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦的「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」會議，探討廣泛議題，包括貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率之間的關係、貨幣政策分歧對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對其他地區的外溢效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該研究所亦於八月舉辦了第十三屆 HKIMR 夏季研討會，並於九月舉行了第十三屆 HKIMR 大陸經濟會議，探討中國大陸財政改革及地方政府融資等相關議題。這些會議與研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的參與者。此外，該研究所本年度還舉辦了24場公開講座，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n二零一五年年底，流通中的紙幣總價值為港幣三千六百零二億元，較上年增加百分之五點三（圖表六、七及八）。流通中的政府發行紙幣及硬幣總價值為港幣一千一百二十億元，較上年上升百分之二點九（圖表九及十）。流通中的政府發行港幣十元紙幣價值為港幣四十億元，其中百分之八十五為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將監管重點放在獲授權機構的風險管理上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為。隨著系統性風險的積聚，香港金融管理局於2016年1月1日起實施香港地區0.625%的逆周期資本緩衝（並於2017年1月1日起提高至1.25%）。五間獲授權機構被指定為系統重要性銀行，將適用較高的資本吸收能力緩衝。在立法會引入《金融機構（紓困及重整）條例草案》後，有關復原及重整的改革工作取得重大進展。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融專業人員的技能與知識水平。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 總覽\n\n在全球主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的背景下，2015年新興市場面臨資本外流風險上升及經濟增長放緩的壓力。為維持銀行業在宏觀經濟環境可能急劇惡化的情況下保持韌性，香港金融管理局持續密切監察獲授權機構（AIs）風險治理機制及其信貸及流動性風險管理系統的有效性。\n\n# 操作監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採用監管方法，即定期現場檢查並配合更多主題性審查。主題性審查為非現場審查，專注於特定風險領域或特定活動，針對所選的機構發牌人進行深入審查。此方法使香港金融管理局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於機構發牌人所面臨的 emerging 及較為重要的風險。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局共進行了193次現場檢查。考慮到信貸風險管理及資產質素方面出現惡化跡象，香港金融管理局進行了更多深入主題的現場檢查。面對主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分化所引致的市場不確定性，香港金融管理局亦增加了與財務部門相關活動的檢查次數。此外，亦進行了與內地相關業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、運營及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，以及信貸風險評估模型（IRB模型）的現場檢查。本年度，專門團隊亦對信貸機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）相關業務方面的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查相同之領域。表1載明運作監督工作的詳細資料。\n\n2015年，共進行196次現場外審，以評估銀行機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管機構的關注重點包括風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸及巴塞爾三協議標準的落實監測。監管團隊與所選銀行機構的董事會及外部會計師事務所保持頻繁聯繫。與銀行機構高階管理階層及外部會計師事務所舉行了20場三方會議，並與所選銀行機構的董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了23場會議。\n\n銀行監督審查委員會審查了四個案例，所有案例均涉及人工智能的授權問題。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以應對競爭性優先事項，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續根據《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求持牌機構委任外部會計師跟進可能具有重大影響的監管問題。2015年，香港金融管理局根據該條款委託進行了六份報告。其中兩份報告涉及反洗錢\/反恐融資控制，另外兩份報告涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，無任何人工智能違反銀行條例有關資本充足率或流動性比率的規定。根據條例各項條文共有84宗違規情況，但這些違規情況並未影響存款人的利益，且人工智能已及時予以糾正。\n\n表1 操作監督\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力\n\nMellie Bank有限公司仍受《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力所規管。2008年6月25日，貨幣管理局根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條，對 Mellie Bank有限公司香港分行的業務、營業及財產所作出的指示，在本財政年度內仍然有效。貨幣管理局會繼續與相關當局保持定期溝通，以監察該分行及其英國總行的發展情況，並留意已採取的監管措施，以保護AI存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評級審查\n\nCAMEL審批委員會審查並確定各AI的綜合CAMEL評級。各AI已知悉該評級，並有機會提出複核申請。本年度內無任何複核申請。\n\n# 專門監督工作\n\n# 操作與科技風險的監督\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據不斷出現的新風險及行業發展，持續發佈有關運作及科技風險管理的新指引或更新指引。特別是，HKMA已完成對《監管政策手冊》（SPM）中與電子銀行（e-banking）相關模組的修訂，使自動櫃員機（AI）在提供新電子銀行服務方面擁有更多靈活性。此外，HKMA亦發佈了一項通函，強調自動櫃員機的董事會及高層管理人員應對有效網絡安全風險管理進行監督。HKMA亦定期發佈其《運作事件通報》，重點介紹所選取的詐騙案件或運作事件的作案手法，以及所識別出的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）推行以風險為基礎的主題性現場及非現場監管審查，評估所選取的銀行機構在企業層面或特定業務線中運營及科技風險管理的狀況。這些審查涵蓋與銀行機構運營風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防範違規交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、詐欺風險管理以及反洗錢科技控制相關的特定領域。這些監管審查亦由年度獨立合規活動補充，涵蓋運營風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務連續性計劃，所選取的銀行機構須委任獨立且具資格的評估者，審查其相關控制措施的充分性，並針對所識別的弱點進行改善。此外，香港金融管理局亦識別及分析銀行機構運營及科技風險的趨勢及主要監管關注點，特別針對在維護香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定與有效運作方面發揮重要作用的銀行機構。\n\n香港金融管理局監察銀行業在2015年底完成基於晶片的自動櫃員機技術的最後階段實施情況，透過此技術，人工智能已完成純信用卡的換卡程序。香港金融管理局亦要求發卡機構實施認證控制，以進一步提高「無卡交易」信用卡交易的安全性。另外，接獲報告指某些無接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可被隱蔽地訪問後，香港金融管理局要求有關機構迅速採取行動，通知並保護受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局亦投放資源進行宣傳及解釋事件的規模及影響，以回應公眾關注，並監察機構的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他相關持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦有關網上銀行安全預防措施的公眾意識提升計劃、建立一個分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為由香港金融服務業業務持續性管理論壇主辦、並涉及人工智能企業及其他金融機構的危機管理演練提供支援及意見。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃的發售提供指引及進行監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管委員會的主持下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議覆蓋涉及不同金融服務行業領域內具有密切業務關係的金融集團或受規管機構的各項議題，以確保監管行動更具協調性和有效性。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局進行了25次現場及非現場主題檢查及15次非現場監察，覆蓋投資產品的銷售、證券交易結算處理及客戶證券的安全保管，以及涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非連結長期人壽保險（NLTI）產品及強積金（MPF）相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月，香港金融管理局向人工智能發出 circular，為其提供有關向客戶銷售非壽險投資產品時進行適合性評估及產品資訊披露的指引。該指引旨在協助人工智能遵守監管標準，包括保險監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與財政司司長辦公室（財政司）密切合作，參與2014年《保險公司（修訂）條例》的立法程序，以建立獨立的保險業監管局及為保險中介機構設立法定牌照制度。七月，立法會通過《保險公司（修訂）條例》2015，其中規定，透過授權，金融管理局可就保險代理機構的保險中介業務進行審查及調查。\n\n香港金融管理局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗由RIs提出的從事附加受規管活動的申請。其批准了204名負責監督RIs證券業務的高級管理人員的申請，並對由RIs提交以納入香港金融管理局維護登記冊的9,697名人士進行背景審查。\n\n# 財務活動監督\n\n人工智能機構的流動性風險管理一直為香港金融管理局（HKMA）的重點監管關注事項，尤其在美國利率預期正常化以及隨後可能出現的資金流動反轉的情況下，這種反轉可能對人工智能機構的流動性狀況產生影響。2015年全年，香港金融管理局持續實施針對人工智能機構的加強版穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金來支撐其貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起實施巴塞爾III流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）後，香港金融管理局一直監測第一類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構的LCR通常維持在100%或以上，遠高於2015年在過渡期安排下法定最低60%的要求。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）就所選人工智能機構（AIs）的控制框架進行主題性現場審查，以管理與預期利率正常化相關的風險。在市場波動的背景下，HKMA亦密切關注市場的急劇變化及其對銀行業以及個別人工智能機構的影響，並採取適當的後續行動。\n\n# 管理層主導的壓力測試方案\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行自下而上的監管主導壓力測試計劃，以更好地了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟環境下的韌性，並鼓勵銀行制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的計劃。本年度為收集更細緻的資料，以更深入理解特定領域的風險動態，已推行多項改進措施。香港金融管理局分析了參與機構提交的結果，並與它們討論如何進一步改善其壓力測試程序。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 貸款成長與資產品質\n\n近年來觀察到的強勁信貸成長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已趨緩。全年來看，銀行業總貸款額增長3.5%，較2014年的12.7%明顯減緩（見表2）。由於客戶存款成長速度高於銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率從去年同期的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 資產管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是風雲變幻的一年，投資基金面臨前所未有的挑戰。在如此困難的投資環境下，發行基金在2015年的總投資回報為-0.6%，但與主要市場指數及類似投資基金相比，其虧損情況相對較輕。這歸功於香港金融管理局過去數年所採取的一系列防禦性措施，這些措施已有效提升發行基金的抗風險能力。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n香港發行基金的主要目標，如《發行基金條例》所訂明，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。該基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，協助香港維持其國際金融中心的地位。發行基金由財政司司長控制，並在諮詢發行基金顧問委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於其認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交換基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\nEFAC為交易所基金設定了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保有資本；  \n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候皆完全由高流動性、以美元計價的資產所支持；  \n(c) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣與金融穩定；以及  \n(d) 依(a)至(c)之條件，以達成有助於維護基金長期購買力之投資報酬。\n\n這些目標已全面考慮發行基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n\n廣義而言，發行基金有兩個主要組合——支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有高度流動的美元資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的規定，為基礎貨幣提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。兩個組合整體的長期目標債券與股票比例為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，81%的資產配置於美元及港元，其餘19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並在中長期提升回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已以謹慎及逐步的方式，將部分發行基金（Exchange Fund）的投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私人股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私人股權及物業投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。香港金融管理局在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持為發行基金累計結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計為1,421億港元，其中私人股權為913億港元，物業投資為508億港元，並有1,224億港元的未償投資承諾。\n\n由於此組合具有獨特性質，因此自2007年成立以來用以持有香港交易所及清算有限公司股份的戰略投資組合，並未納入基金投資表現的評估範疇。此組合的股份是由政府為交易所基金的戰略目的而購入的。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券及期貨事務監察委員會的投資過程是以兩種資產配置決策為基礎 —— 战略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資指標中，代表根據證券及期貨事務監察委員會的投資目標所制定的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以期取得高於指標的投資回報。這通常意味著實際配置與指標或戰略性配置有所不同。實際配置與指標配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然指標及戰術性偏離的上限是由財政司與證券及期貨事務監察委員會協商後確定，但戰術性決策則由香港金融管理局在授權範圍內作出。在戰術性偏離允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可根據短期市場走勢進行投資。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n儲備管理部的香港金融管理局員工直接管理約76%的發行基金投資，其中包括整個後備組合及投資組合的一部分。該投資組合的一部分包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一組組合，以及實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生產品對沖組合。\n\n# 外部管理機構的使用\n\n除內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦委任設立於多個國際金融中心的外部基金管理機構，管理約24%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產。委任外部管理機構的目的是利用市場上最優秀的投資專業知識，以捕捉多樣化的投資風格，並將市場的知識及資訊轉移至內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金經理費與保管費、交易費用以及扣繳及其他稅費。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。為內外部管理的投資組合已建立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監督對指引及規則的遵守情況。風險控制工具被用來評估在正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內外部管理者的投資能力。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動極大，尤其股市面臨異常的波動。年初時，主要股市達到歷史新高。然而，市場情緒在第三季度急劇惡化，主要是由於對中國大陸經濟增長的擔憂，導致主要股市回吐當年以來的漲幅，並出現顯著的季度跌幅。隨後，隨著市場情緒有所改善，全球股市也有所復甦，但到了年底又再度走弱。由於與中國大陸經濟密切相關，香港股市在2015年表現不如其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場上，儘管市場預期美國將進行利率正常化並啟動美國利率上行週期，但2015年較長期限的美國國債收益率仍小幅上升，因全球經濟增長的擔憂、持續存在的全球通縮壓力以及升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢抑制了正面情緒。另一方面，由於歐洲央行採取積極的貨幣寬鬆政策，短週期的歐洲政府債券收益率下降，部分甚至跌入負值領域。\n\n在貨幣市場上，2015年美元持續走強，美元指數幾乎上漲了10%，市場預期美國將開始政策利率正常化。另一方面，歐元在第一季顯著走弱，創下自1999年歐元推出以來單季最大跌幅，原因是歐洲央行於1月宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。相較之下，日圓在2015年對美元基本維持不變。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n面對極其波動的金融市場及困難的投資環境，2015年貨幣發行局投資基金錄得投資虧損達158億港元，其中包括海外股票的獲利71億港元、香港股票的虧損50億港元、債券的獲利159億港元、非港元資產因貨幣兌換造成的負面影響449億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司所持其他投資的獲利111億港元。由於去年美元大幅升值，貨幣發行局將非美元投資轉換為港元時，不可避免地出現了負面的貨幣兌換影響。另外，戰略投資組合錄得評值獲利22億港元。\n\n截至2015年底，發行機構的總資產達到3,4229億港元。2015年，發行機構（不包括戰略組合）的投資回報為-0.6%。然而，與表現不佳的主要市場指數及投資基金界相比，發行機構的虧損可視為較輕微。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局在過去幾年已採取一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化步伐，特別是透過長期資產組合計劃（LTGP）進行投資。這些措施已增強發行機構的抗風險能力，並有助緩解部分潛在虧損。\n\n1994年至2015年基金的年度回報請參見圖表1。表2顯示2015年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為1.2%，過去五年的平均回報為1.8%，過去十年的平均回報為3.3%，自1994年起的平均回報為5.0%。表3顯示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組成。\n\n圖表 1 交易所基金投資回報（1994 – 2015 年）  \n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略組合的持倉。  \n2. 組合消費者物價指數是根據以 2009\/2010 年為基期的系列計算。\n"}

The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，香港金融管理局透過支持員工專業發展、推行嚴謹的財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安及重新分配高層管理人員職責，改善公司治理，以協助應對因實施新計劃及系統及工作日益複雜而產生的挑戰。\n\n# 參與社區企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒保持緊密合作，以提高透明度並促進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。2015年，共舉辦了59項公開傳媒活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14場站立式訪問及31項其他公開活動。此外，還安排了43次傳媒訪問，發佈了325份雙語新聞發佈稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n此外，為提升公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，分別舉辦兩場媒體參觀活動，帶領媒體到香港紙幣印刷有限公司及香港銀行間清算有限公司（HKICL），展示香港世界級的紙幣印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時，亦舉辦有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及發行基金的教育講座，為媒體提供更深入的簡介，以加強對這些重要議題的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德銘（中）及貨幣管理總經理黃保華（右）於訪問香港印鈔有限公司期間，檢查紙幣上的安全特徵。\n\n媒體巡禮期間展示的自動支票分類演示。照片中間（由左至右）為香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖先生、財務基礎設施總經理李家強先生，以及香港國際商業信貸銀行總裁唐慧珠女士。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一個有效途徑，以獲取香港金融管理局的資訊，使他們更深入了解該機構的主要職能。2015年，該服務共處理了9,078宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢涉及銀行政策與規則、紙幣硬幣以及消費者銀行服務等主題。值得注意的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品與服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收藏計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年起接獲的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則說明2015年查詢類型的細項。\n\n圖表 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，香港金融管理局過去一年亦發佈兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》、四期《季刊通訊》及定期發佈《月度統計通訊》的更新版本，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新及主題性資訊及分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇《洞察》文章，涵蓋各類具時效性和當前重點的政策議題。\n\n2014年香港金融管理局年報在2015年香港管理協會「最佳年報獎」的「非營利機構及慈善組織」類別中獲得了銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局的機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過五萬頁的英文及繁體與簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條設立的「授權機構證券從業員登記冊」及「授權機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站將會載有根據該條例設立的「儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊」。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以引導公眾關注有關詐騙電話提醒、硬幣收集計劃中硬幣推車位置等重要及時資訊。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心設於兩國金融中心55樓，是向公眾介紹香港金融管理局工作及推廣有關貨幣及銀行事務知識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，並於每週開放六日。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展情況，並提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的參考資料及展品，供公眾研究之用。\n\n資訊中心為訪客提供導覽服務。本年度，該中心接待訪客逾48,300人次，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導覽活動（見圖3）。自2003年12月資訊中心開幕以來，已有超過530,400人次造訪該中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，用以深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，維護香港的自動櫃員機（ATM）電子登記冊。\n\n在香港金融管理局持續推行的社區接觸計劃下，該機構繼續舉辦公開教育講座。2015年，共有約2,300名中學生及教師參與了三場講座，主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用以及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，已有超過54,700人參與了相關活動。\n\n圖3 訪問資訊中心的團體訪問類型\n\n年輕的遊客在導覽員帶領下參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n中學學生與教師參與公開教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招募、培訓及維持一支高度專業化的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作優先事項。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的一部分，但其可採用與公務員制度不同的聘用條件，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局旨在維持一個精簡而靈活的組織結構，並重新配置員工資源，以推行新舉措及應對工作量的增加。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年12月在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立零售支付監管組，以履行HKMA在儲值支付工具及其他零售支付系統的牌照發放及日常監管方面的新法定職責。為加強部門之間的協作，並重新優化人力資源以應對新措施實施所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量和工作複雜性，有關部門於2015年計劃進行職務調整，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n財務基礎建設部門（FID）接掌了執行部門（ENFD）及貨幣管理局（MMD）的存款保障計劃的管理職能，以及結算功能。此外，FID亦接掌了銀行部門部分與銀行業相關的工作，包括消費者教育、董事培訓以及銀行從業人員的增強能力架構。\n\n外部部門接掌了MMD的市場開發功能，而後者將繼續處理與財務市場協會及金融指標相關的工作；\n\nENFD 接管了銀行監督部門的反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險處，並更名為執法及反洗錢處。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 人力配置\n\n2015年香港金融管理局（HKMA）的職位數為841個，2016年增加34個至875個（增加4%），以確保有足夠資源應對以下事項：(i) 新法例及措施的落實；(ii) 維持持續進行且已被證明必要的試點計劃；以及(iii) 現有工作的複雜性及工作量不斷增加。新增職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行及金融體系的穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場檢查、實施國際銀行標準及同儕評審活動；\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監督；\n\n實施有關透過銀行及獲批准的現金經紀進行場外交易（OTC）衍生工具的監管架構，並遵守新生效的場外衍生工具報告及記錄規則；\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法工作；\n\n正在籌備及進行實施《金融機構（處理）條例》的計劃及準備工作，以國際標準應對金融業「太大而不能倒」的問題；\n\n透過發展一個針對銀行獨立非執行董事的董事賦權計劃，以推動銀行業的能力建構，進而改善銀行治理，並與業界合作，促進銀行從事核心業務領域專業人員的增強能力框架。\n\n加強在新銀行、證券及保險產品方面的銀行行為政策與研究能力。\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；並\n\n加強對在岸人民幣市場及CNH市場發展情況的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場有序運作。\n\n加強對與設立未來基金相關的擴大投資活動，以及證券基金投資產品進一步多元化所涉及的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並在投資環境日益嚴峻的情況下，提升戰略資產配置及投資流程。\n\n實施新頒佈的法定制度，賦予香港金融管理局權力，根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》規管儲值支付工具及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業功能\n\n臨時人力資源會根據其他工作需求進行調配。香港金融管理局會將員工調任至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助與香港或香港金融管理局有利益關係的活動或政策項目。部分員工會以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障局及財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據發行基金顧問委員會（EFAC）的建議，並徵詢治理小組委員會（GSC）的意見，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，考慮當前市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及職業退休金計劃，福利以現金形式為主，實物福利極少。現金薪酬包包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及變動薪酬，變動薪酬可根據員工表現，每年以一次性發放的形式授予個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局員工薪酬每年由金融事務委員會根據香港金融管理局在上一年度的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問機構進行的金融行業薪酬調查結果以及任何其他相關因素，向金融事務委員會提出建議後進行審查。有需要時，亦可酌情為表現優異的個別員工作出特別薪酬調整，以維持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬調整或香港金融管理局（HKMA）的變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工個人表現進行發放。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員適用於一種變動薪酬制度，旨在強化其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。對於職級為總經理或以上的員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，由金融服務辦公室（FS）根據諮詢財務委員會（GSC）的意見批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬時並不在場。對於職級為部門主管或以下的員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金融管理局總行政長根據金融服務辦公室的授權，在批准的總體薪酬獎勵範圍內作出決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 交易所基金\n\n稽核長報告  \n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 稽核長報告\n\n# 审计委员会\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其子公司（「集團」）於第134至222頁所載之財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及集團於2015年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收入支出表、綜合損益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及重要會計政策摘要及其他說明資訊。\n\n# 財政局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒佈的行政長官指示，以及香港財務報告準則，編製提供真實公允視點的財務報表，並負責貨幣管理局認為為確保財務報表無重大誤導（無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致）而必要的內部控制。\n\n# 會計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計工作，就這些財務報表發表意見。我根據《發鈔兌換基金條例》第7條所訂立的總督指令及審計委員會的審計準則進行審計。這些準則要求我遵守倫理要求，並計劃及執行審計工作，以獲得合理保證，確認財務報表在重大誤導方面並無重大錯誤。\n\n會計師執行審計時，會進行某些程序以取得有關財務報表中金額及披露的審計證據。所選程序取決於會計師的判斷，包括對財務報表存在重大誤報風險的評估，這種風險可能源自詐欺或錯誤。在進行這些風險評估時，會計師會考慮與實體編製能提供真實且公允視圖的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適合當前情況的審計程序，但並非用以就實體內部控制的有效性表達意見。審計還包括評估財政當局所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及其作出的會計估計是否合理，同時評估財務報表的整體呈現是否恰當。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據已足夠且適當，足以作為我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 审計長報告（續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n依我之見，財務報表符合香港財務報告準則，並真實、公平地反映交換基金及其集團於二零一五年十二月三十一日的財務狀況，以及該財務狀況在該會計年度內的財務表現及現金流，並已按照根據《交換基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示適當編製。\n\nDavid Sun\n審計長\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會  \n26樓  \n移民大樓  \n Gloucester Road 7號  \n灣仔，香港\n\n# 目錄\n\n收入與支出帳戶\n綜合收益表\n資產負債表\n權益變動表\n現金流量表\n會計師報告\n\n1. 主要業務  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變更  \n4. 收入與支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產及金融負債類別  \n7. 現金及隨時動用的資金  \n8. 存放於銀行及其他金融機構的資金  \n9. 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產  \n10. 可出售證券  \n11. 派生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期日的證券  \n13. 貸款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 子公司的權益  \n17. 聯營公司及合營企業的權益  \n18. 投資性不動產  \n19. 應計資產、廠房及設備  \n20. 債券、政府發行的貨幣紙幣及硬幣流通量  \n21. 銀行業務體系的結餘  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構的存放款  \n23. 財政儲備的存放款  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構的存放款  \n25. 發行的發票及紙幣  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 其他發行的債務證券  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股東權益  \n30. 现金及现金等价物的流量分析  \n31. 操作業務分部資訊  \n32. 抵押資產  \n33. 承諾  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重要關聯方交易  \n36. 財務風險管理  \n37. 金融工具的公允價值計量  \n38. 資產負債表後的非調整事項  \n39. 2015年12月31日財年尚未生效的修訂、新標準及解釋可能產生的影響  \n40. 財務報表的批准\n\n# 財政儲備基金 – 收支帳戶\n\n2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 綜合收益表\n\n2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 款項結餘表\n\n2015年12月31日截止日期\n\n陳國強  \n貨幣管理局  \n2016年4月7日\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 所有者權益變動表\n\n2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 现金流量表\n\n2015年12月31日止年度\n\n# 財政儲備 – 现金流量表（續）\n\n2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註屬於這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註\n\n（金額以千萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長所授予的權限，作為發行基金的主管機構（該基金），根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。該基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的兌換價值，並確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產被管理為四個組合：後備組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。後備組合的資產完全與香港的貨幣基礎相匹配，根據香港的貨幣發行局制度。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私人股權及不動產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由香港特別行政區政府為基金的戰略目的而購入的。經營部門資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 二、重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個總稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港特許會計師學會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋及會計準則，並符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其子公司（以下統稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新訂及修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於當前會計期間首次生效或可供早期採用。附註三提供有關因首次採用這些發展而導致會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並說明這些變更對本集團在這些財務報表所載當前及前會計期間的影響。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以千萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在合營企業及聯營公司的權益。主要子公司、聯營企業及合營企業的主要業務，請參閱附註16及17。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按下列會計政策中所說明的公允價值列示：\n\n交易金融工具（見附註 2.6.2.1）；  \n以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（見附註 2.6.2.2）；  \n可供出售證券（見附註 2.6.2.5）；  \n黃金（見附註 2.11）；以及  \n投資性不動產（見附註 2.12）。\n\n依香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製財務報表，需管理層作出影響會計政策應用及資產、負債、收入及開支所報告數額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設是根據經驗及其他各項因素作出，並在當時情況下認為合理，其結果成為作出有關資產及負債攜帶價值判斷的基礎，而這些攜帶價值並非來自其他來源。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及其相關假設會持續進行審查。若修正僅影響當期，則會在該期間認列會計估計數字的修正；若修正同時影響當期及未來期間，則會在修正期間及其後的各期認列。\n\n附註18包含有關投資性不動產公允價值評估所涉及的假設資訊。附註37包含有關金融工具公允價值評估所涉及的假設資訊。除附註2.5所列舉的某些金融工具的計量外，集團會計政策的應用不涉及任何重大會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司與非控制性權益\n\n子公司為集團所控制之實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而有權獲得變動性回報，或有權取得變動性回報，且能透過其對該實體之控制權影響該回報。評估集團是否具控制權時，僅考量實質權利（由集團及其他當事人所持有）。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以千萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n對子公司的投資，自取得控制權之日起，直至失去控制權之日止，均納入集團財務報表中合併。\n\n於編製集團財務報表時，集團內各公司間的帳戶餘額、交易及現金流動，以及因集團內交易而產生之未實現損益，均應全部抵銷。\n\n非控制權益代表屬於子公司但並非直接或間接歸屬於基金之權益，且集團與這些權益持有人並未訂立任何附加條款，這些條款將使集團整體對這些權益負有符合財務負債定義的契約義務。非控制權益在集團財務報表中列示於權益項目內，並與屬於基金所有者的權益分開列示。集團的非控制權益在集團損益表及綜合損益表中，以當年度盈餘或虧損以及總綜合損益或損失在非控制權益與基金所有者之間的分配方式列示於表中。\n\n基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資以成本減去已確認的減值損失列示（參見附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 合夥人及聯營企業\n\n關聯機構係指集團透過參與其財務及營運政策決策之權力，對該機構之管理具有重大影響力，但並無控制或共同控制該機構之情況。\n"}
