{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong

行政長官聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟見到穩定增長；通貨膨脹仍然低於預期；該年美國聯邦儲備系統進行三度加息，並縮減資產負債表，卻未造成新興市場經濟的資本外流或美元走強。在牛氣沖天的市場情緒下，全球股市，包括三大美國股市指數，持續創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲34%。恒生指數在2017年錄得近8,000點（或36%）的升幅，並突破30,000點關卡，於2018年1月達到歷史高點。\n\n許多投資者在這樣一個有利的環境下充滿樂觀，甚至有些過度興奮。然而，這一切持續到今年年初的二月上旬，當最新數據顯示美國工資增幅高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市出現顯著調整。道瓊斯指數在二月第二週的兩天內下跌超過1,000點，恆生指數在同一週亦下跌超過3,000點。美國10年期國債收益率上漲至高達2.95%。資金流動的迅速逆轉顯示，創下歷史新高的市場估值並非建立在紥實的根基之上。這也提醒我們，香港需要一個穩健且強健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動及資金外流所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 防患未然措施提升銀行體系韌性\n\n有云「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局於2017年實施進一步的風險緩釋措施，以保障香港銀行及金融系統的穩定。5月，我們推出第八輪逆周期措施，針對銀行的按揭貸款，並加強銀行對向地產商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在加強銀行系統對物業市場逆轉所引致衝擊的抗風險能力。透過多輪措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比由2009年9月的64%下降至2017年底的49%，而平均償還比率亦由2010年8月的41%下降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決方案辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被認為「太大而不能倒」的不可持續金融機構。這將幫助避免重蹈2008年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時政府動用公帑拯救即將倒閉的金融機構，並減低這些機構結業對金融體系、經濟及整個社會的影響。\n\n強健的風險管理是銀行業穩定及可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率均遠高於適用的法定要求，並位居全球前列。這無疑顯示香港銀行體系具備高度的抗風險能力。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款額增加16%，而資產質素亦維持穩定。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%下跌至0.54%，遠低於自2000年起的長期平均值2.2%。根據稅前營運利潤計算，銀行業的整体股本回報率在2017年達11.74%，與其他國際金融中心相比，屬於健康水平。\n\n# 穩健銀行是長期財務穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機暴露了單憑規則和法規來制約金融業追求盈利而無視其主要責任的局限。基於此情況，香港金融管理局在近期加強推廣「穩健銀行」的實踐，鼓勵銀行發展並追求良好的企業文化與價值觀。特別是為解決銀行員工追求短期利潤而損害其顧客或銀行長期利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行設立與其企業文化及價值觀一致的適當激勵制度。作為此計劃的一部分，我們於2017年3月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事年會，以突顯建立良好銀行文化的 importance，並幫助獨立非執行董事更有效地發揮其監督與監察的責任。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，2017年為香港金融管理局在推動金融包容方面取得成功的一年。六間實體銀行分行及三間流動分行開始在偏遠地區運作。香港銀行協會與EPS及一家便利店連鎖店合作，推出試驗計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的商店提款，無需進行購物。香港郵政亦於今年在主要位於離島及新界地區的七間郵政局推出為長者提供的現金提款服務。有關開戶方面，香港金融管理局去年設立了專頁及電郵賬戶，並設有專責團隊跟進與開設銀行賬戶相關的公眾查詢或投訴。由於多方持份者的努力，開設個人及公司銀行賬戶的客戶經驗已出現顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來重大轉變\n\n在科技快速進步的時代，金融科技已逐步融入我們的日常生活。在這不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須把握新發展，並在應用金融科技方面追求創新。隨著智慧銀行的新紀元，香港金融管理局於9月推出了七項倡議（詳見106頁以獲取詳情），推動金融科技在銀行業的採用，以加強銀行產品及服務的質素，為顧客帶來更大效益。雖然這些倡議彼此獨立，但亦屬互補，將會為香港支付及銀行服務的未來生態帶來重大改變。顧客不僅能享受更方便、快捷及安全的支付及銀行服務，亦將擁有更多選擇及對其財務交易有更大控制權。金融科技將成為銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁進智慧銀行的新時代，將為銀行提供一個重大機會，以進行升級及轉型。\n\n# 龐大機遇由一帶一路及灣區 initiatives 締造\n\n國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，香港擁有多元化金融產業至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局加強推動香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。鑑於香港具備「背靠內地、維持國際視野」的獨特優勢，絲綢之路經濟帶及粵港澳大灣區的發展將為香港金融及銀行業帶來龐大機遇，並為香港經濟增長帶來新的動力。為響應絲綢之路經濟帶，香港金融管理局設立基建融資促進辦公室，自推出以來，其合作夥伴數字已增至約90家，為推動香港成為基建投資融資中心打下紥實根基。2017年，中國開發銀行在香港發行首隻絲綢之路經濟帶債券，突顯香港在促進這些基建項目融資方面可發揮的樞紐地位。\n\n除基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極參與香港作為企業財務中心、私人股權基金及亞洲衍生產品業務樞紐的發展，透過吸引國際企業及主要金融機構在香港管理其資金、資產及各種財務風險。這些措施將進一步鞏固及升級香港的金融及相關專業服務業。香港金融管理局亦與負責灣區發展的有關當局保持緊密溝通，以加強合作，並致力促進該地區作為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港金融業一直以「善用香港優勢，配合國家所需」為主軸持續發展。隨著2014年推出上海證券交易所與香港證券交易所的股票通，2016年推出深圳證券交易所與香港證券交易所的股票通，以及去年7月推出債券通北向交易，香港金融平台已將內地與全球其他地區之間的市場准入從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯香港作為金融中介的獨特地位，促進全球投資者進入內地金融市場。2017年，香港繼續維持其作為離岸人民幣業務領先全球樞紐的地位。人民幣實時 gross settlement 系統的平均每日成交額高達9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計，全年全球人民幣支付交易中，超過70%是經由香港處理。離岸人民幣市場繼續有序運作並穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才以鞏固銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融行業持續發展，培育人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局注重銀行業的軟實力，我們一直鼓勵及支持銀行從業員持續提升專業能力。繼在強化能力框架下推出反洗錢及反恐融資及網絡安全兩項專業資歷模組後，我們去年擴展了其覆蓋範圍，包括零售財富管理及財務管理，以透過持續專業發展提升銀行從業員的核心能力。香港金融管理局亦致力培育銀行業的年青人才。2017年，我們與業界合作推出了私人財富管理見習學徒計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。鑑於反應熱烈，這些計劃的覆蓋範圍將會在未來進一步擴展。\n\n# 謹慎投資策略於中長期取得合理且平穩之報酬\n\n在全球經濟強勁增長的背景下，發行基金去年錄得創紀錄的投資收入高達2,640億港元，各類資產類別均有佳績，包括股票、債券及外匯。整體投資回報達7.4%。投資組合的回報率為12.1%，而後備組合則取得1.8%的回報。自2009年啟動以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部回報率已達高達13.7%。雖然去年投資表現屬佳績，但投資環境日益複雜，香港金融管理局需繼續謹慎管理發行基金。我們將維持機動靈活，密切監察市場發展，並在適當時候部署防禦措施。LTGP下的投資亦將進一步擴展。一如往常，我們會在可控風險水平內，秉承「資本保值為先，長期增長為後」的投資原則，管理香港市民的財富。\n\n雖然全球實體經濟延續去年的升勢，但2018年仍潛藏不確定性及風險。這些包括一旦通脹回升，美國利率便會加快加息步伐、貿易摩擦升溫以及地緣政治生態惡化。倘若這些下行風險觸發，將對全球金融市場產生顯著且廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟產生連鎖影響。因此，我們應該謹慎管理風險。\n\n未來數月，香港美元利率走勢將繼續受到關注。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備系統已提升利率六次。隨著香港美元利率與美元利率之間的息差擴闊，資金由香港美元流向美元的動機變得更大。近期香港美元持續走弱，且7.85弱方保證金（CU）已觸發。正如我們一再強調，當7.85弱方保證金被觸發時，香港金融管理局將扮演「超級貨幣兌換商」的角色，透過在市場上購買香港美元及出售美元，以確保香港美元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。此類操作屬正常範疇，並按照聯匯制度的設計進行。這不會引起任何擔憂。事實上，目前貨幣發行局持有的資產價值超過4兆港元，其中香港美元貨幣基礎約為1,700億港元，可為資金外流情況提供強大的緩衝。多年來，貨幣發行局已設立多個防線以保障銀行及金融體系的穩定。從正面來看，資金外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，這有助於香港利率環境的正常化，因而促進本地經濟及資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，貨幣發行局將保持嚴陣以待，並作出一切努力以維持香港的貨幣及銀行體系穩定。\n"}

Nevertheless, the public remains highly confident in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe money markets continue to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"city":["城市"],"end":["年底"],"people":["市民"],"built":["建立"],"expanded":["擴展"],"achieving":["取得"],"continuing":["持續"],"pursue":["追求"],"us":["我們"],"saw":["見到"],"abound":["潛藏"],"record":["紀錄"],"remained":["仍然"],"since":["自"],"HK":["香港"],"49":["49%"],"launch":["推出"],"first":["首"],"adoption":["採用"],"webpage":["專頁"],"year":["年"],"increasing":["增加"],"facilitating":["促進"],"billion":["億"],"’":["的"],"lives":["生活"],"great":["重大"],"marks":["適逢"],"competence":["能力"],"developments":["發展"],"reversal":["逆轉"],"indicated":["顯示"],"Thanks":["經"],"brought":["帶來"],"secure":["安全"],"introduction":["推出"],"classified":["不良"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"developers":["地產商"],"2014":["2014年"],"transform":["轉型"],"developing":["開展"],"widening":["擴闊"],"strengthen":["鞏固"],"operate":["運作"],"campaign":["計劃"],"upgrade":["升級"],"maintained":["維持"],"technological":["科技"],"hence":["因而"],"2008":["2008年"],"highlight":["突顯"],"era":["新紀元"],"among":["位居…前列"],"role":["地位"],"41":["41%"],"weathered":["克服"],"addition":["此外"],"fell":["跌"],"pursuing":["追求"],"enhancing":["加強"],"coming":["未來"],"launched":["推出"],"times":["次"],"stepped":["加強"],"efforts":["努力"],"February":["2月"],"1.8":["1.8%"],"concerted":["多方"],"established":["設立"],"11.74":["11.74%"],"together":["一同"],"ensure":["保證"],"result":["造成"],"weaken":["走弱"],"responsibilities":["責任"],"play":["發揮"],"modules":["專業資歷"],"RMB900":["9,000億元人民幣"],"2010":["2010年"],"practitioners":["從業員"],"second":["第二"],"involved":["參與"],"closures":["結業"],"integrated":["融入"],"implement":["落實"],"moving":["邁進"],"make":["讓"],"give":["帶來"],"part":["部分"],"convenient":["方便"],"case":["一旦"],"dropped":["下跌"],"also":["亦"],"gained":["錄得"],"May":["5月"],"always":["一向"],"vigilant":["嚴陣以待"],"created":["締造"],"undoubtedly":["顯示"],"light":["情況下"],"round":["輪"],"needs":["所需"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"sustainable":["可持續"],"competition":["競爭"],"2.2":["2.2%"],"increase":["上升"],"7.85":["7.85"],"foundation":["根基"],"accounts":["賬戶"],"revealed":["暴露"],"quarter":["四分之一"],"smoothly":["有序"],"maintain":["保持"],"perform":["發揮"],"recurrence":["重蹈"],"week":["同周"],"3,000":["3,000"],"set":["設立"],"dollars":["美元"],"several":["多個"],"last":["去年"],"including":["包括"],"shocks":["衝擊"],"high":["新高"],"pace":["步伐"],"world":["全球"],"within":["內"],"response":["呼應"],"stated":["強調"],"century":["世紀"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"significant":["顯著"],"adhered":["秉承"],"25th":["25周年"],"satisfactory":["佳績"],"changing":["變"],"extending":["延續"],"Given":["鑑於"],"page":["專頁"],"close":["緊密"],"greater":["更大"],"September":["9月"],"ever":["以來"],"held":["舉辦"],"introduced":["推出"],"coverage":["覆蓋"],"need":["需求"],"Six":["6"],"develop":["發展"],"include":["包括"],"triggered":["觸發"],"manage":["管理"],"25":["25"],"restrain":["制約"],"wage":["工資"],"leveraging":["善用"],"eighth":["第八輪"],"improvement":["改善"],"all-time":["歷史"],"consolidate":["鞏固"],"Enormous":["龐大"],"highlighted":["突顯"],"stood":["高達"],"importance":["重要性"],"agile":["機動"],"responsible":["肩負"],"pivotal":["樞紐"],"reached":["達"],"allowing":["讓"],"good":["好"],"independent":["獨立"],"highs":["新高"],"0.72":["0.72%"],"put":["將"],"0.54":["0.54%"],"advantage":["優勢"],"spotlight":["焦點"],"prevent":["避免"],"around":["約"],"dialogue":["溝通"],"used":["動用"],"cure":["治療"],"safeguard":["保障"],"appropriate":["適當"],"months":["月"],"prompting":["促使"],"particular":["特別"],"advancement":["推動"],"providing":["提供"],"highest":["最高"],"saying":["有云"],"without":["未有"],"nimble":["機動"],"store":["便利店"],"achieved":["取得"],"oversight":["監督"],"corrections":["調整"],"implications":["影響"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"effort":["努力"],"meet":["應對"],"maintaining":["維持"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"continued":["繼續"],"position":["地位"],"minimise":["減低"],"35":["35%"],"expense":["損害"],"empower":["幫助"],"worked":["合作"],"years":["年"],"2018":["2018年"],"closely":["密切"],"issuance":["發行"],"establishing":["樹立"],"long":["長期"],"diversified":["多元化"],"underscores":["突顯"],"landscape":["生態"],"healthy":["健康"],"promoting":["推動"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"easily":["不易"],"solid":["紥實"],"ongoing":["持續"],"task":["任務"],"efficient":["快捷"],"recently":["近期"],"gradual":["逐步"],"back":["背靠"],"positive":["正面"],"fail":["倒"],"perspective":["來看"],"106":["106頁"],"laying":["打下"],"advisable":["應該"],"various":["多個"],"innovation":["創新"],"follow":["跟進"],"attaches":["注重"],"widespread":["廣泛"],"Many":["許多"],"downside":["下行"],"relying":["依靠"],"T.L":["T.L."],"hikes":["加息"],"status":["地位"],"264":["2,640億"],"inaugural":["首屆"],"offer":["帶來"],"bullish":["牛氣沖天"],"next":["之後"],"reappraise":["重新評估"],"society":["社會"],"continue":["繼續"],"outlying":["離島"],"taking":["採取"],"roles":["角色"],"strengthened":["加強"],"areas":["地區"],"one":["一"],"nurturing":["培育"],"Indeed":["事實上"],"levels":["水平"],"enhance":["提升"],"worst":["最壞"],"actively":["積極"],"successful":["成功"],"line":["主軸"],"convenience":["便利"],"normal":["正常"],"trillion":["兆"],"deteriorating":["惡化"],"movements":["走勢"],"currently":["現時"],"impetus":["動力"],"pressure":["壓力"],"8,000":["8,000"],"launching":["開展"],"supporting":["支持"],"arranged":["安排"],"gains":["回報"],"Supporting":["支持(組合)"],"1.7":["1,700億"],"reduction":["縮減"],"Regarding":[

摘要：2017年重點\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在 globally 經濟同步擴張的支撐下，以較快步伐增長。本地股市上升，住宅物業市場維持升勢，而住房負擔能力亦進一步收緊。\n\n香港銀行業維持安全與穩健，資本及流動性地位強勁，資產質素健康。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港貨幣對美元回軟，原因是兩種貨幣之間的負息差擴闊。然而，公眾仍高度信心維持聯匯制度。\n\n資金市場繼續有序運作，銀行間流動性充裕。香港基本利率上調總共75厘至1.75厘，因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的上升。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在銀行風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸、流動性及科技風險管理。第八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施已推出，以鞏固銀行業界對物業市場任何逆轉的抗風險能力。\n\n在政策方面，國際監管標準的本地落實已取得重大進展。解決機制已生效，為銀行體系穩定建立起新的主軸。解決辦公室作為香港金融管理局為讓解決機制在香港銀行業運作而作出的努力的一部分而設立。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n七項新舉措已推出，以把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇，並推動香港成為亞洲的金融科技中心。香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象，亦因一連串網絡及能力建設的努力而進一步提升。\n\n香港維持其在離岸人民幣業務中的領先地位。債券通的推出鞏固香港作為通往內地中國機遇的主要門戶的地位。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n受惠於有利的投資環境，證券及期貨事務監察委員會達到了創紀錄的投資收入2,640億港元，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n投資分散化努力持續進行，特別是透過長期成長組合（LTGP）。LTGP 自 2009 年成立以來，已記錄年化內部報酬率為 13.7%。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳媒、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續透過支持員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律及加強資訊科技保安，以應付因落實新舉措及工作繁重程度增加而引起的新挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally

經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟擴張更加同步的背景下，香港在2017年見到經濟增長加快、勞動市場狀況趨緊及通脹壓力較低。2018年的經濟增長預期將維持紥實。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港經濟於2017年增長加快。實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長，以及過去10年約3%的長期增長率（圖1及表1）。內在需求穩固，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出回升。較強的內在需求反映就業及收入狀況有利，資產價格上漲，以及企業信心改善。在外圍方面，香港貨品出口因全球貿易流量增加而擴張速度加快，服務業出口則因貿易及貨運流量暢旺，以及入境旅遊興旺而恢復增長。貨品進口因出口帶動的需求而錄得較強勁增長，服務業進口則因本地居民旅遊興趣強勁而穩定上升。淨額計算，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長造成負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，香港美元匯率一般較美元回軟，主要由於在港元與美元之間出現負利率差幅的情況下，利率套利活動所推動。這反映聯匯制度按照其設計正常運作。雖然香港銀行間利率仍然處於相對低水平，但由於新股發行相關的資金需求及銀行年底流動性需求，2017年底香港美元利率面對較大的上揚壓力。在信貸增長方面，經過兩年單位數增長後，總銀行貸款在2017年以明顯加快的16.1%速度增長，反映經濟狀況改善及金融市場情緒正面。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸發放標準並無鬆動跡象，整體貸款質素仍然良好。\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在2017年整個期間仍然受到良好控制（圖2）。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率下降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%為低。特別是，價格指數中的住宅組成項目以較緩的步調上升，反映2016年新簽訂私人住宅租金增幅放緩的滲透效應。更廣泛而言，在強勁產出增長的背景下，名義工資和收入較溫和的上升有助於遏抑本地成本壓力。進口價格通脹亦屬溫和，與香港主要進口來源地低通脹情況一致，即使美元貶值亦然。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n勞動市場在2017年隨著高於趨勢的經濟增長而收緊。經過季節調整的失業率從2016年的3.4%下降至2017年底的2.9%，這是近20年來首次低於3%（圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門的失業率均有回落，其中零售、金融及專業及商業服務業的降幅較為明顯。隨著總體就業增長加快，以及私人部門的空缺數字增加，整體勞動需求繼續鞏固。勞動力亦擴展，部分反映年長員工（55歲及以上）參與度提高。與較緊的勞動市場狀況及較低的通貨膨脹一致，實質工資及收入增長加快。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市在2017年幾乎沒有間斷地持續上升。恒生指數上升36%，為自2010年以來最大的年度升幅（圖4）。這波漲勢反映市場對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並部分得益於內地投資者透過港股通流入的大量資金。恒生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底仍然維持在高水平。平均每日成交額擴展至由上年的港幣669億增至港幣883億，而來自本地市場的整體融資額亦上升至港幣5814億，較上年的港幣4901億有所增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持升勢（圖4）。交易量由去年同期的54,701單位擴展至61,591單位，2017年樓價上升14.8%。樓價與收入比率進一步收緊，達16.4，較1997年的歷史高位為高，而收入 gearing 比率為74.1，遠高於長期平均水平。考慮到樓價上升及銀行間對按揭業務競爭越趨激烈，香港金融管理局於5月推出第八輪審慎措施，以鞏固銀行風險管理及保障銀行體系穩定。這些措施實施後，樓價升勢短暫放緩，但在第四季重新加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，全年交易活動顯著上升，交易價值及成交量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報較上年微升。\n\n# 前景展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2018年的經濟增長預期將維持紥實。政府預測增長幅度為3至4%，而私人部門分析師預測經濟將以平均3.2%的速率擴大。在外圍方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受惠於全球增長前景的提升及 inbound 旅遊業逐步復甦。在國內方面，私人消費增長預期將維持穩定，主要原因是就業市場狀況有利。至於固定資本形成，建築及建設活動應在住宅供應上升及持續的基建項目推動下穩步推進。雖然經濟狀況改善將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升可能帶來阻力。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在全球通脹仍然溫和，本地成本穩定上升的情況下，香港的通脹壓力預計在2018年仍會維持溫和，但通脹率相信會逐步從2017年的低水平回升。例如，通脹的租金組成項目可能在2018年下半年增強升勢，這是因為新簽訂私人住宅租金的增加所帶動。市場共識預測，2018年的 headline 通脹率將仍屬溫和的2.2%，而政府預測基礎通脹率將為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築及建造業活動的擴大，以及入境旅遊逐步復甦，預計會在未來一段時間內維持勞動市場偏緊。私人機構分析師預測，失業率在2018年將維持在約3.0%水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景在若干不明朗因素及風險下展開，包括與主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定性相關的風險，以及保護主義情緒升溫及地緣政治緊張關係惡化等情況。特別而言，若這些風險觸發香港資金流動出現逆轉，本地貨幣狀況可能比預期更快收緊，構成對實體經濟及資產價格的下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍不明朗。在短期內，現時有利的國內經濟狀況、被認為的住房短缺、低按揭利率以及其他的住房融資來源（包括物業發展商提供的按揭貸款及來自父母的財務支援），將繼續支撐物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會拖累市場情緒。長遠而言，物業市場將繼續面對多項阻力。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化持續進行，本地按揭利率最終將上升。此外，基於政府努力增加土地及住宅物業的供應，住房需求與供應的差距預期會逐步收窄，這將緩和長遠而言物業價格的升勢壓力。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在2017年繼續保持安全穩健，不論全球經濟環境存在哪些不明朗因素。獲授權機構（AIs）的資本及流動性狀況仍然強健，資產質素維持在健康水平，而且盈利明顯改善，這歸功於息差上升及信貸增長強勁。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的一個月及三個月期利率分別上升了49個基點及39個基點。然而，最明顯的升幅則出現在第四季。不過，零售銀行的港元資金成本，以綜合利率來衡量，全年大致保持平穩（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行香港分行的整體預稅營業利潤在2017年增長了15.8%。此改善表現主要由於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）及手續費及佣金收入增加（+9.4%）。然而，這些增加部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下降（-29.9%）及營運費用增加（+8.4%）所抵銷。零售銀行的整體稅後利潤因2016年錄得某些非經常性項目而下跌了18.1%。零售銀行的稅後資產回報率由2016年的1.44%降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨利息 margin 擴闊至 2017 年的 1.45%，較 2016 年的 1.32% 上升（圖

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管對港元匯率的壓力有所減弱，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍繼續以有序的方式運作，並擁有充裕的流動性。聯匯制度已成為維護香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支點，並展現出高度強大的承受衝擊能力，以應對多個衝擊。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在 HK$7.75 至 HK$7.85 內的穩定外匯價值。貨幣體系的結構特點是貨幣發行制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有 100% 由存於發行基金內的美元儲備所支持，並要求貨幣基礎的變動與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 欠款證書，為三間發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 整體結餘，即銀行在香港金融管理局的結算賬戶結餘總和\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的貨幣基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局堅決履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾來維持的。當對香港美元的需求大於供應，而市場匯率升至強方兌換保證 HK$7.75 至一美元時，香港金融管理局會準備好向銀行沽出香港美元以換取美元。整體結餘將隨之擴大，推低香港美元利率，創造出使香港美元離開強方上限、並維持在 7.75 至 7.85 的兌換區內的貨幣狀況。相反地，若香港美元的供應大於需求，而市場匯率下跌至弱方兌換保證 HK$7.85 至一美元時，香港金融管理局會從銀行購入香港美元。整體結餘將隨之收縮，推高香港美元利率，使香港美元離開弱方上限，並維持在兌換區內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定\n\n香港貨幣兌換率在2017年整體見到壓力放緩（圖1）。在港元與美元利率息差擴闊的情況下，主要因利息套戥活動而推動，港元對美元逐步回軟，從1月3日的7.7566跌至8月22日的年低7.8265。在9月下旬至11月上旬期間，港元兌換率錄得一定強勢，因新股發行相關資金需求而提升港元流動性，並在7.80至7.81的窄幅範圍內穩步交易。年底時，港元再次出現壓力放緩，部分反映港元流動性狀況微升，以及年底商業對美元需求增加。整體而言，港元兌換市場在2017年整個期間運作正常。\n\n由於CUs未被觸發，2017年（圖2）整體結餘及未償EFBNs總額約為港幣1,225.3億，維持無大變動。當年，香港金融管理局發行額外港幣800億港元的發行基金債券，以應對銀行對流動性管理需求的上升。這導致整體結餘減少至2017年底的港幣179.8億。額外發行發行基金債券的舉措符合發行貨幣制度的原則，因為這僅代表貨幣基礎組成部分的改變，即從整體結餘轉移至未償EFBNs。貨幣基礎仍全面由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 財務市場\n\n香港美元銀行同业利率在2017年的首八個月維持偏軟，其後至年底面對更多上升壓力（圖3）。儘管有對美國聯邦儲備局加息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，香港美元銀行同业利率在首八個月一般仍然偏軟。因此，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在1月至8月期間擴闊。從9月起，短週期香港美元銀行同业利率出現顯著回升，主要由新股集資活動及年底資金需求推動。相應地，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在短週期範疇收窄。總體而言，2017年短週期銀行同业利率主要交易於基本利率以下。\n\n基準利率於3月15日、6月14日及12月14日上調，總共上調75個基點，由1.00%調升至1.75%。此期間，美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調了三度，總共上調75個基點，由0.50至0.75%調升至1.25至1.50%。基準利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的修訂公式進行的，該公式規定基準利率設立為：以美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的下限為基準，上調50個基點，或以香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的隔夜及一個月利率的五日移動平均數的平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，港元期貨點數的貼現於首三個季度逐步擴闊，12個月港元期貨點數在9月中達到約-615點（圖4）。在第4季，港元期貨點數的貼現微升，與港元與美元息差的負息差收窄同步。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行間流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗口貸款額由2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯匯匯率制度\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯匯制度（LERS）一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支柱，並在一系列地區及全球金融危機中展現出高度強大的承受衝擊能力。政府已重申對聯匯制度的十足承諾，其承諾的可信度亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步加強。香港市民對港元作為支付手段及保值工具的強大信心亦持續存在。在2017年對香港的第四條項諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織重申對聯匯制度的支持，並評論指出聯匯制度仍然是香港最佳的匯率安排。配合強大的金融監管及監督、謹慎的財政管理以及靈活的市場，聯匯制度已與時俱進，有效地幫助香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯匯制度維持香港的最佳安排。」\n\n一個穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業貸款、與物業相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管努力，以增強銀行業的韌性。隨著美國聯邦儲備系統繼續回復至正常貨幣政策，香港美元利率亦會逐步回復至正常水平。香港金融管理局重申，在LERS的設計下，資本流出、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方保證金調節機制以及貨幣基礎減少，都是港元利率回復至正常水平的必要過程。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並做好應對潛在金融動蕩的準備。\n\n為加強貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的發行基金資產分配用以背靠貨幣基礎。背靠比率，定義為背靠資產除以貨幣基礎，於2017年內維持在106.7%至108.2%之間，未觸及上或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收市為108.1%（圖5）。根據LERS，雖然已指定特定發行基金資產用以支持背靠組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在面對突發衝擊時，發行基金龐大的財政資源將提供強大的後盾，以保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（CBC）為發行基金顧問委員會的子委員會，監察並審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的問題。2017年，CBC考慮多個問題，包括香港樓價短暫波動的動因、HIBOR與倫敦銀行同业拆借利率（LIBOR）息差的決定因素、內地物業估值變動對企業融資的影響，以及按揭貸款償還負擔對香港私人消費的影響。CBC就這些問題進行的討論紀錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。在過去三 年，HKIMR 更加強調其活動的政策相關性。這特別反映在其研討會活動及訪問 fellowship 計畫上。HKIMR 並與主要中央銀行及政策機構聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。同時，於 2016 年推出的主題研究 fellowship 計畫，亦持續支持更多與 HKMA 視為重要的政策問題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了18位研究學者，並公布了29篇工作論文。該中心當年亦舉辦了四項國際會議及工作坊：\n- 第八屆亞洲經濟國際會議，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：將往何處去？」，於1月在香港舉行。該會議為學者、政策制定者及業界專家提供一個討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析及政策議題的平台。會議共發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革及國際溢出效應等議題，亦包括人民幣匯率議題及內地貨幣政策架構與傳導機制等。\n- 香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）第十五屆夏季工作坊於7月舉行。該工作坊旨在為HKIMR及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的員工提供發表研究論文的機會，並加強研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）與國際貨幣基金組織聯合舉辦的題為「匯率的價格、實質與金融影響」的會議於8月舉行。該會議為深入且具洞察力的討論提供了平台，涵蓋的議題包括匯率制度、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備積累過程中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場的行為。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）、美國聯邦儲備理事會及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行共同贊助的題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗汲取」的會議於10月舉行。該會議檢討了過去十年內主要央行所採用的非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗與教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興市場的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實質經濟與金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out

銀行業穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局繼續將監管重點放在獲授權機構風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施被推出，以加強銀行業對物業市場逆轉的應對能力。面對網絡威脅不斷上升，香港金融管理局加強了對獲授權機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，香港金融管理局推出了七項舉措，以預備香港邁入智能銀行的新紀元。獲授權機構反洗錢及反恐融資控制的成效，仍然為香港金融管理局監管重點之一，作為其打擊金融犯罪的其中一部分努力。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局採取進一步舉措，推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容性，並解決小型及中型企業及新創公司在香港開立及維持銀行賬戶時所遇到的困難。同時亦作出努力，加強對獲授權機構銷售投資及保險產品的監管，以進一步提升客戶保障。\n\n在國際監管及會計準則本地落實方面取得重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比例、大型 exposures 限制、回收計劃及國際財務報告準則第 9 號。為支持在不斷變化的銀行環境及演變中的風險生態下對能力建設的需要，香港金融管理局協調行業發展董事權力計劃及銀行從業員增強能力架構。\n\n《金融機構（紓困）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數設有全面跨部門紓困機制的金融穩定委員會成員地區之一。該條例透過建立新的防線以維護金融穩定，賦予貨幣管理局在可能對系統造成不利後果的情況下，以有序方式管理金融機構失敗的必要權力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的一般目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於金融體系具高度強大的承受衝擊能力，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其營運方式影響系統的穩定性，並在極端情況下，以混亂的方式失敗，亦會對系統穩定性造成影響。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在確保銀行具備強大的承受衝擊能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位，從而保障金融穩定方面，發揮關鍵地位，這最終有助於避免失敗。貨幣管理局亦肩負銀行業務的審慎監管責任，包括在香港從事存款業務。其職責亦包括在香港授權持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及存款機構，這些機構 collectively 稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。貨幣管理局亦負責某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監督。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法保證，亦非香港審慎監管框架的設計目的，是要保證一個零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為一個解決機構，旨在確保在認可機構出現故障的情況下，解決行動可以以有序的方式進行，以維持認可機構為其顧客所提供的關鍵金融服務的持續性。為此，香港已設立針對金融機構的解決制度，其中貨幣管理局為認可機構及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了192項離場審閱，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括銀行的CAMEL評級、公司治理、業務運作及風險管理。作為HKMA繼續推動人工智能機構（AIs）強化風險治理的一部分，HKMA與人工智能機構的董事會或董事層委員會舉行了30場會議，討論重點為重要的風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監察其近期有關公司治理指引的採用情況。HKMA亦與人工智能機構及其外部會計師舉行了27場三方會議。\n\n除離場活動外，香港金融管理局繼續進行定期的現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為較高風險地區的主題審查。這種做法使香港金融管理局能夠優先配置監管資源，重點關注人工智能機構所面對的 emerging 及較為顯著的風險。香港金融管理局在該年度進行了 401 次現場檢查及主題審查。信用風險管理及控制仍然為這些檢查及審查的重點。另一個主要重點是科技風險及運作風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加針對流動性及市場風險管理以及反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制的海外檢查及現場檢查及主題審查數字。專門團隊亦進行了針對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）相關業務的人工智能機構活動的現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險管理\n\n# 信用成長與資產品質\n\n總銀行貸款增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%增長率有所提高。根據表2所示，貸款增長具有廣泛基礎。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款在2017年底增長17.5%至HK$4,188億（表3）。此數字包括香港註冊銀行的內地子公司所入帳的HK$644億貸款。\n\nAI 的資產質素在 2017 年仍然健康。零售銀行的不良貸款比率自 2016 年年底的 0.72% 下降至 2017 年年底的 0.54%，遠低於自 2000 年以來的長期歷史平均值 2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，不良貸款比率由 0.85% 下降至 0.67%。至於與內地相關的貸款，零售銀行的不良貸款比率由 2016 年的 0.82% 下降至 2017 年的 0.75%。就整個銀行業而言，比率由一年前的 0.80% 下降至 0.67%。\n\n本年，香港金融管理局加強了監管努力，以確保信貸機構繼續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，加強了對信貸機構對主要企業之 exposures 的監察。並進行了針對性的主題審查，重點關注貸款發放標準、貸款分類及撥備系統、信貸風險治理架構，以及對地產商、資產抵押融資及保險 premiums 融資之貸款風險管理。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n物業價格在2017年繼續上升。有更多由銀行機構提供的貸款涉及擁有多於一項按揭或收入來自香港以外地區的借款人。考慮到這些發展，香港金融管理局於5月19日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高銀行機構計算新住宅按揭貸款資本要求時的風險權重基準、降低針對已有按揭借款人的物業按揭貸款適用貸款價值比（LTV）上限，以及降低針對收入主要來自香港以外地區借款人的物業按揭貸款適用償還比率（DSR）上限。\n\n香港金融管理局自2009年起推行的宏觀審慎措施，已提升銀行對房地產業市場相關風險的抗風險能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）在2017年12月已由2009年9月的64%下降至49%，當時宏觀審慎措施首次推出前的水平。平均負債收入比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月的41%下降至2017年12月的35%，當時首次對DSR設有上限（圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局觀察到，一些地產商在進行物業發展項目時採用較高的槓桿比率，並為物業買家提供較高的貸款價值比率按揭。為解決這些發展所帶來的風險，香港金融管理局於5月12日推出針對物業發展貸款的新風險管理措施。這些措施包括要求發牌機構降低建築融資的融資上限；要求發牌機構為貸款予貸款比例較股本較高的物業發展項目設立更多資本；並進行一輪主題審查，以確保銀行繼續遵循謹慎的貸款標準，向物業發展項目提供貸款。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局與土地註冊處於2月開展了一項e-Alert服務。該e-Alert服務在土地註冊處為抵押物辦理進一步抵押登記時，會向有關認可機構發出通知，以便抵押銀行能選持適當的風險緩解行動。\n\n# 運營及科技風險的監督\n\n網絡安全威脅在整年持續上升。香港金融管理局加強了監管努力，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為香港金融管理局於2016年推出的網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）的一部分，30間資深機構已完成對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。另一方面，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）在與銀行及證券業進行廣泛諮詢後，聯合決定推出網上股份交易的強制雙因素認證。此外，亦進行了一輪現場審查，專注於銀行的網絡安全控制及運營韌性。香港金融管理局進一步完成了一輪與主要銀行高層管理人員的討論，評估銀行如何管理潛在新市場參與者因科技進步而帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月，香港金融管理局宣布一項措施組合，協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行的新紀元。在監管方面，香港金融管理局將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行及科技公司均可使用的聊天室設施，以及在香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會及保險業監管局之間建立聯繫，以便提供一個進入點，用以進行跨行業金融科技產品的試驗。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出「銀行業務簡化計劃」，旨在識別及減低監管摩擦，以進一步提升顧客使用金融科技及網上銀行服務的經驗。一個工作小組已設立，現時重點為遠程開戶及帳戶管理、網上金融及網上資產管理。\n\n現有虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討工作已展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n\n# 財務活動監督與流動性風險管理\n\n隨著美國繼續回復至正常貨幣政策，全球資金流動可能會變得越來越波動。考慮到這一點，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年加強了對流動性風險的監管重點。HKMA 增加了對流動性壓力測試的監管，並加入了更多情境，包括一個更具壓力但較為合理的資金流出情境，以及一個短期、信心驅動的銀行擠兌情境。HKMA 亦加強了對個別人工智能（AIs）流動性狀況的監測與分析，並規定部分 AIs 加強其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局進行了更多針對人工智能機構在其債務證券組合方面市場風險管理的現場審查。一輪主題性審查已進行，以評估人工智能機構在外幣債券上增加投資活動所引起潛在風險，並評估相應風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖做法。\n\n# 防範洗錢及恐怖主義融資（ML\/TF）\n\n《反洗錢及反恐融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於2017年6月23日刊憲，並於2018年生效。此修訂旨在根據金融行動特別工作組（FATF）所頒佈的最新國際標準，更新香港的反洗錢\/反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管制度。這些變更，加上對AML\/CFT法定指引的更新，將有助於釐清及落實在開立帳戶及維持真實顧客的客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序中的風險為本方法，並鼓勵在遙距進行這些程序時的創新。\n"}

Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力於提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新舉措旨在促進銀行及支付行業在金融科技的發展與使用，亦獲得持份者及公眾的廣泛接納。香港作為基礎設施投資融資門戶的國際形象亦進一步提升，這歸功於一連串在這方面網絡及能力建設的努力。債券通的推出進一步鞏固香港作為通往內地機遇的主要門戶地位。香港金融管理局在其他領域如企業財務中心的相關努力亦已見成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n基於快速的科技發展，香港金融管理局於9月宣布推出七項舉動，以預備香港邁入智慧銀行的新紀元。這些舉動包括：\n- 開展快速支付系統（FPS），以取得數碼零售支付的十足連繫；\n- 推出開放應用程式程式設計介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才發展；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 升級我們現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的推出；以及\n- 推動「銀行業務輕鬆辦」新舉動，以減低顧客在數碼經驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局銀行部門一同發揮樞紐作用，推動落實這些措施，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的夥伴數字由成立時約40間增至2018年1月31日的87間。當年，IFFO舉辦並參與超過10場研討會及工作坊，促進持份者之間的經驗分享及合作聯繫。特別是在其首屆債券融資及投資者圓桌會議中，IFFO主導制定基礎設施股權投資參考協議範本，以加強基礎設施項目之融資可行性及投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於7月推出，標誌香港與內地資本市場互聯互通邁向另一重要里程碑，並進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。本年，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由人民幣270億元增至人民幣5,000億元。香港維持全球最大的人民幣離岸流動性池，並展現暢旺的人民幣金融中介活動，這從我們人民幣實時總額結算系統（RTGS）的高交易量以及香港人民幣支付活動佔全球絕大部分可見一斑。\n\n繼2016年推出企業財資中心（CTCs）稅制後，香港金融管理局加強了其推廣努力，以吸引更多跨国企業在香港設立財資中心。至2017年底，超過40%的企業向香港金融管理局反映，他們正積極計劃在香港設立，或已設立財資中心業務。\n\n香港金融管理局積極貢獻於國際層面對影響全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題的討論。香港金融管理局行政總裁於4月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，以領導有關關鍵金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及快捷運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務中心的地位奠定了紥實的根基。2017年，四間銀行間實時清算系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）實現了100%系統可用性，較目標的99.95%有所提升。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已設立賬戶，與兩間內地中央證券登記結算機構（CSDs）合作，以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表有關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為推動本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，香港金融管理局於8月根據支付條例（PSSVFO）指定4宗零售支付系統（RPSs），以將其運作納入香港金融管理局的監督範疇。香港金融管理局亦積極監督16間儲值支付工具（SVF）發牌機構，這些機構推出新產品及服務，旨在為顧客提供更多選擇及理想使用經驗。另一方面，電子支票及電子發票展示及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，包括香港與廣東省全部地區之間的跨境付款。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n基於科技的快速發展，香港金融管理局於9月宣布了七項舉動，旨在幫助香港準備邁入智能銀行的新紀元。這些舉動旨在幫助銀行業提升至較高水平，並把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n「智慧銀行會為零售及企業顧客帶來十足的互相連繫，並允許以重大移動性、速度、便捷性及安全性執行金融服務與交易。」\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界及金融科技社群密切合作，並在落實七項倡議方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 加快付款系統\n\n快速支付系統是一種多貨幣平台，會讓公眾能透過使用電話號碼或電郵地址，以實時方式輕鬆進行全天候資金轉帳。該系統可支持港幣及人民幣付款。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與快速支付系統，讓所有支付參與者之間實現十足連繫。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，快速支付系統預定於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個工作小組，成員包括主要信用卡發卡機構、銀行、持牌儲值支付工具發牌機構及商家收單機構，以建立香港零售支付的共同二維碼標準。建立共同二維碼標準將促進商家使用單一二維碼接受來自多個支付服務提供者的二維碼支付解決方案，為顧客及商家提供更大便利。該工作小組已最終確定有關技術規範，並會落實相關實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式程式設計介面\n\n開放式API讓第三方得以存取銀行的資料，以促進銀行及其他行業所提供的服務更理想且更易融入。用戶因此可於一系統內方便地享用安全環境下的整合服務。為促進銀行業界對開放式API的發展與採用，香港金融管理局已擬備一份開放式API框架草案，內容包括一組開放式API職能及部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商管理、促進措施及維護模式，並進行兩月的行業諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n其中一項重大研究專案是關於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年首份DLT白皮書之後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月公布。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三個證明概念的應用，即貿易融資、數位身分管理及房貸申請。它亦提供有關在銀行及支付業界部署DLT時，治理、法律及合規，以及一般控制原則的落實建議。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳過健先生於香港金融管理局金融科技日宣布發佈有關區塊鏈的第二份白皮書。\n\n藉由香港金融管理局領導的貿易融資實證計劃的成功，香港七間銀行決定將原型系統商業化，建立名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）的生產系統，以實現貿易文件的數位化與共享，自動化流程，以提升整體貿易流程，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險與詐欺行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出金融科技職業加速計劃。學生的反應正面。共收到421名申請人提交的超過3,000份申請。最終，有74名學生獲香港金融管理局及12間銀行接受，從7月起開始進行为期六個月或一年的與金融科技相關的實習項目。\n\n# 跨國合作\n\n作為加強我們在廣東廣州-香港-澳門灣區合作的首步，我們與深圳合作，推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽訂協議，內容包括：(i) 提供雙方互惠的軟著陸支援，以協助金融科技企業落地；(ii) 聯合舉辦深圳-香港金融科技獎，於10月舉行，以表彰及獎勵兩城優秀的金融科技產品及解決方案；以及(iii) 為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德銘（中）於香港金融管理局金融科技日，與OFDS總監-general何曉軍（左）及創新科技園董事局主席李 George 藝博士簽署及交換有關軟落地安排的備忘錄。\n\n深圳香港金融科技獎電子宣傳單\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務管理局簽訂金融科技合作協議，就創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊分享及專業知識交流等方面展開合作。\n\n11月，香港金融管理局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署備忘錄，聯合建設全球貿易連繫網絡（GTCN），以便將新加坡國家貿易平台連接至香港貿易金融平台，以建立跨境區塊鏈基礎設施，用以數位化跨境貿易及貿易融資流程，使其更安全、快捷且具成本效益。該平台將是一個開放平台，未來允許其他有意參與的地區加入。GTCN預計於2019年的首季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局於2016年9月推出的FSS已升級至FSS 2.0，以促進與銀行及科技公司的溝通，推動新理念及新措施。具體而言，FSS 2.0有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管對話室，以便在金融科技專案的早期階段為銀行及科技公司提供意見。\n- 科技公司可透過向對話室尋求意見，而無需經由銀行便可使用FSS。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會及保險業監管局的沙盒已聯繫起來，使跨行業金融科技產品的試點計劃有單一進入點。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS已測試28項新科技產品。其中14宗為試點試驗，已順利完成，相關產品隨後已推出市場。\n\n# 銀行業務輕鬆辦行動方案\n\n「銀行業務簡化」計劃已推出，以減低阻礙科技創新之監管摩擦。目前重點關注以下地區：\n- 遠距開戶及帳戶管理\n- 網上金融\n- 網上財富管理\n\n# 網上銀行\n\n虛擬銀行由於未有實體分行，預期將為香港金融科技的應用帶來增發動力，並在行動及數位銀行服務中帶來一種新的基本客戶體驗。它們亦可幫助推動金融包容性，因為它們通常針對零售範疇，包括個人或中小企業（SMEs）。香港金融管理局已啟動對現有虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n\n# 智能銀行的新紀元\n\n#

Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

資產管理\n\n2017年全球經濟及金融市場表現理想，高過預期。全球股市因主要發達及新興市場經濟體同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行會逐步緩慢收緊貨幣政策而造好。雖然美國聯邦儲備局如預期般三次提升利率，並於10月開始減少資產負債表規模，但10年期美國國債收益率仍然平穩，美元對其他主要貨幣不見強勢（反而回落）。在這樣有利的環境下，2017年證券投資基金的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下紀錄，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n證券交易所基金的主要目標，如《證券交易所基金條例》所訂立，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的交換價值。該基金亦可動用以保持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以幫助香港維持國際金融中心的地位。證券交易所基金受財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）後，投資於證券或其他他認為適當的資產。\n\n# 財政儲備基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\nEFAC 已為發行基金設立以下投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 保證在任何時候，全部貨幣基礎皆全面由高度流通性美元資產支持；\n(c) 保證為維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的，有足夠流動性可用；及\n(d) 依(a)至(c)之條件，爭取投資回報，以幫助維持基金之長期購買力。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮發行機構的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n\n大致而言，發行基金有兩大資產組合：後補組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。後補組合（BP）持有高度流通性極高的美元計價資產，以提供十足後補，符合貨幣基礎在貨幣局制度下的規定。投資組合（IP）則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國家的債券及股權市場，以保障資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升長期回報，香港金融管理局已以謹慎及循序漸進的方式，將發行基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券及股票、私人股權及不動產。新興市場及內地債券及股票由投資組合持有，而私人股權及不動產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長組合（LTGP）下投資的市場價值上限設為發行基金累計盈餘的三分之一，並可透過將未來基金的部分資產分配至長期資產而進一步增加投資容量。\n\n於2007年設立的戰略投資組合，用以持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，這些股份是由政府為交易所基金的帳戶購入，用作戰略目的，由於此投資組合的獨特性，因此不包括在基金投資表現的評估範疇內。\n\n# 存款與發行基金\n\n香港發鈔銀行有時會接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP1表現掛鉤，但未來基金則視乎投資組合的組成，其利率與IP及LTGP掛鉤。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為65：35。預期未來基金與LTGP掛鉤的部分將逐步增加至2018年約50%。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券交易所基金的投資過程是因投資目標而提升的，並基於兩種資產配置類別的決定：戰略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資指標中，代表證券交易所基金投資目標下的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略性配置的指導下，資產會戰術性地進行配置，以爭取超越指標的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與指標或戰略性配置不同。實際配置與指標配置之間的差距稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然指標及追蹤誤差上限是由財政司與證券及投資產品監管局（EFAC）磋商後定出，但戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）在授權下設立。在戰術性偏離的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可選持頭寸，以爭取短期市場走勢的優勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部的員工直接管理約73%的發行基金投資，包括全部BP及IP的部分。該部分IP包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多個實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具對沖投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理人員\n\n除內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦僱用外部基金管理機構管理約27日的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他專門資產類別。僱用外部管理機構的目的是運用市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以取得可持續的回報，從多樣化及互補的投資方式中受惠，並與發行基金分享市場心得及技術知識。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易費用以及扣繳及其他稅費。此支出主要由市場因素所定出，且可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n2008年全球金融危機後，財務市場的高波動性突顯了風險管理的重要性。為內置及外圍方面管理的投資組合，已設立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規則的遵守情況。為支持發行基金投資分散化的加快步伐，風險評估已加強。風險控制工具亦已採用，以評估在正常及不利市場狀況下的市場風險。亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，讓香港金融管理局能善用內置及外圍管理者的投資技巧。\n\n# 肩負投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任的投資。例如，香港金融管理局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發行的《負責任擁有權原則》，這些原則屬自願性質，並幫助投資者評估如何最好地應對其在香港上市公司的投資所涉及的擁有權責任。在管理證券交易所基金方面，香港金融管理局已鼓勵其香港股票投資組合所委任的外部基金管理人採納《負責任擁有權原則》來管理投資。此外，交易部及風險管理及合規部已將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素融入多個內部程序，以制定及監察投資活動。香港金融管理局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入投資程序。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2017年金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟及金融市場表現理想，高於預期。在主要發達及新興市場經濟體同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將緩慢及逐步收緊貨幣政策的背景下，全球股市表現亦佳。特別是香港股市上升了36%，表現優於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場，短週期美國國債收益率因美國聯邦儲備系統如預期般連續三次提高利率，並於10月開始縮減資產負債表而飆升。然而，全年來，10年期美國國債收益率仍維持在約2.4%的水平。其他主要國家的10年期政府債券收益率亦幾乎沒有變動，唯獨德國國債因歐元區經濟持續上升以及市場預期歐洲央行將收緊貨幣政策而上升。\n\n在貨幣市場上，美元對其他主要貨幣回落，儘管美國聯邦儲備系統實施了加息，並開始縮減資產負債表。美元的下跌是因為歐洲和日本經濟成長回升，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策差異收窄。2017年，歐元和日圓分別對美元升值約14%和4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現如表1所載。\n\n表 1 2017 年市場回報\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n香港發行局於2017年錄得投資收入達2,640億港元。此包括海外股票產生的回報為804億港元、香港股票產生的回報為583億港元、債券產生的回報為344億港元、非港元資產正面的匯率估值上調為535億港元，以及發行局投資持倉子公司持有的其他投資產生的回報為374億港元。另一方面，戰略投資組合錄得估值回報為45億港元。\n\n去年香港發行機構投資收入高達2,640億港元，創下交易所基金的歷史新高，高出2007年（1,422億港元）的次高紀錄1,218億港元。\n\n證券交易所基金的總資產在年底達 HK$4,015.3 億。長期資產管理計劃下的投資總值為 HK$2,356 億，其中私人股權為 HK$1,572 億，不動產為 HK$784 億。未償還的投資承諾總值為 HK$1,624 億。\n\n2017年交易所基金（不包括策略組合）的投資回報為7.4%。具體而言，IP取得12.1%的回報率，而BP錄得1.8%的回報。自2009年成立以來，LTGP錄得年化內部報酬率為13.7%。\n\n1994年至2017年證券交易所基金的年回報率載於圖1。表2顯示2017年投資回報及基金在多個不同年期的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年的平均回報為2.5%，過去十年的平均回報為2.2%，自1994年起的平均回報為4.9%。表3顯示截至2017年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組成。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁黃偉雄（中）在2017年貨幣發行局基金結果發佈會上發言。\n\n圖1

A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the

企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳媒、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。本年，香港金融管理局繼續透過支持員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律及加強資訊科技保安，以應付因落實新措施及工作繁重程度增加而引起的新挑戰，並改善公司治理。\n\n# 僱用社區企業發展\n\n# 傳媒關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒保持密切合作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及工作之了解。2017年，共舉辦86項開放式傳媒活動，包括九場記者會、16場站立式訪問及61項其他公開職能。此外，亦安排了42次傳媒訪問，並發行總共360份雙語新聞發佈稿。該局亦每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提升大眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局為傳媒舉辦導覽活動，讓他們參觀重新裝修的香港金融管理局資訊中心。此外，亦為本地及海外傳媒舉辦深入的傳媒簡報會及教育工作坊，內容包括債券通計劃、物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、解決方案機制及貨幣發行局投資等廣泛主題。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德銘先生於香港金融管理局資訊中心向傳媒推出一幅名為「細水長流，大有回響」的馬賽克藝術作品。該藝術作品以維多利亞港及香港天際線為主題，並使用總共135,811枚不同面額的香港硬幣締造而成。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁 Chan Norman 先生就香港金融管理局基建融資推進辦公室及金融科技推進辦公室的主要措施，接受本地報章的專訪。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一個有效途徑，以更深入了解香港金融管理局的職能及運作。2017年共處理了8,752宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策及規則、貨幣及經濟問題、消費者銀行服務以及紙幣和硬幣有關。明顯的例子包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函、貨幣及經濟統計資料、物業按揭貸款的審慎措施，以及預防洗錢及恐怖主義融資。\n\n圖1顯示自2014年起收到的公眾查詢數字，圖2則以2017年收到的查詢性質為準提供詳細分析。\n\n圖 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖2 2017年收到的查詢類型\n\n# 刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，2017年香港金融管理局亦公布了兩份半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告及四份季度通訊，並定期發行最新的月度統計通訊，以提供與香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題相關的最新資料及主題分析。此外，香港金融管理局亦發行了共23篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的多個熱門話題。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局的機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過60,000頁的英文及繁體與簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條所維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs的證券從業人員登記冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》所維持的儲值支付工具（SVF）牌照持有人登記冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目短捷連結，以引起公眾對香港金融管理局新舉措的關注，例如開戶程序、儲值支付工具的監管制度、基礎建設融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室，以及重要且時效性的資訊，例如提醒公眾需維持嚴陣以待，以防假冒電話詐騙，以及「硬幣收集計劃」下硬幣推車的設置位置。\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心設於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向公眾介紹香港金融管理局工作的重要資源，並推動社會對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。資訊中心設有展覽區及圖書館，並於每週開放六日。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況，亦提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品供公眾研究。\n\n資訊中心政策部分的新面貌，介紹香港金融管理局的工作及相關金融概念，於2017年2月24日 refurbishment 工作完成後重新啟用。重新設計的政策部分設有多個互動遊戲及裝置，將遊戲融入學習中，以簡潔方式解釋複雜的金融概念。訪客的意見為正面。\n\n學生在資訊中心政策部分的教育遊戲中試玩，以了解香港金融管理局的工作。\n\n資訊中心為訪客舉辦導覽活動。本年度，資訊中心接待了超過59,000名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過650場導覽活動（圖3）。自2003年12月資訊中心啟用以來，已有超過645,000名市民造訪該中心。\n\n該圖書館位於展覽範疇附近，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，用以研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務及中央銀行相關主題。它亦維持根據《銀行條例》第20條所規定的機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及機構的證券從業人員登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的圖書館。\n\n為接觸社區並提升公眾對香港金融管理局工作的認識，香港金融管理局於2017年舉辦了四場公開教育講座，約有2,000名中學生及教師參與。講座內容包括聯匯制度、香港紙幣、銀行體系穩定性、消費者保護、存款保障計劃、金融科技、一帶一路及金融行業職業發展等主題。自1998年該公開教育計劃推出以來，已有超過58,400名市民參與。\n\n不同區的中學學生與教師參與其中一場公開教育研討會。\n\n圖 3 2017年資訊中心團體訪問類別\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招聘、培訓及維持一支高度專業的 workforce，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作優先事項。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的一部分，但其僱用員工的條件與公務員不同，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局旨在保持一個精簡而靈活的結構，並在可行的情況下，重新調配員工資源以推行新舉措，並應對日益增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n決議辦公室於2017年4月1日設立，以落實2016年6月頒布的《金融機構（決議）條例》。該辦公室旨在保證香港的決議機制能為銀行運作。這對於加強香港銀行業在任何危機情況下的韌性至關重要。\n\n# 人力配置\n\n2017年香港金融管理局的設立為927名。2018年將增加35名至962名（增加3.8%），以確保提供足夠資源應付新的措施及現有工作的日益繁重和工作量增加。新職位將採用於以下職能：\n\n- 加強銀行及金融體系穩定，包括：\n    – 加強支持推出「加快支付系統」及便捷銀行措施的能力建設；\n    – 強化監管能力，以應對銀行的區域及業務擴張，並促進（一）在銀行服務提供方面更廣泛採用金融科技，以及（二）與其他監管當局就網絡安全及金融科技事宜進行合作；以及\n    – 支持「詐騙及洗錢情報特別工作小組」的工作，以打擊詐騙、洗錢及其他類別的金融犯罪，並加強法律支援以保證根據反洗錢及受託資金條例所進行的法規執行行動。\n- 加強對交易所基金投資活動進一步擴張及多元化所需的投資、風險管理及其他相關支持。\n- 加強全球宏觀及金融部門監測，並強化人才發展計劃，以保證香港金融管理局擁有必要的人才資源，以應對機構的長期發展所需。\n\n表1說明了香港金融管理局的設立及強大程度。\n\n表1 2018年1月1日香港金融管理局的設立及強大程度\n\n臨時人手被採用以應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局亦會調派員工到其他國際或本地機構進行第二種任職，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助香港或香港金融管理局感興趣的活動或政策舉措。部分員工會以全職或兼職形式被調派，以提供運作支援予香港存款保障局及財政市場協會。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據發行基金顧問委員會（EFAC）的意見，並考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及職業退休金計劃，其中實物福利極少。現金薪酬包包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，浮動薪酬可能根據表現每年一次以現金形式發放給個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局員工薪酬每年由金融事務委員會根據香港特別行政區政府財政司通過金融事務諮詢委員會所提出的建議進行檢討，考慮香港特別行政區政府財政司對香港金融管理局過去一年工作表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問機構進行的金融行業薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他有關因素。有需要時，亦可為個別工作表現優秀的員工作出特別薪酬調整，以保持其薪酬的競爭力。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬調整及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的浮動薪酬獎項，均根據個人表現發放給各員工。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員受浮動薪酬制度所規管，旨在鞏固其投資表現與薪酬獎項之間的聯繫。高級總監及以上級別員工的薪酬調整及獎項，根據顧問委員會（GSC）的意見，由金融服務局（FS）批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬時並不在場。總監以下級別員工的薪酬調整及獎項，則由香港金融管理局總行政長在金融服務局授權下，並在批准的總體薪酬獎項範圍內定出。\n\n#

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

交易所基金\n\n# 审計長報告\n\n# 獨立會計師報告 給財政司司長\n\n# 觀點\n\n我證明我已審核交易所基金及其子公司（「集團」）的財務報表，載於第157至243頁，包括交易所基金及集團於2017年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收入支出賬戶、綜合收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括一項有關顯著會計政策的總結。\n\n依我之見，財務報表已按照香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）發行，由香港特許會計師學會（「HKICPA」）所頒佈，並按照《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條所訂的總督指令，妥為編製，並能真實、公平地反映基金及集團於2017年12月31日的財務地位，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據《發行基金條例》第7條所頒佈的總督指示及審計委員會的審計準則進行了審計。根據這些準則，我的責任已在我的報告中「審計財務報表的會計師責任」部分進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立性，並已按照這些準則履行了我的其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 重要審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為在我專業判斷下，對2017年12月31日終結年度財務報表審計而言具有最重要性的事項。這些事項是在我審計財務報表整體的過程中處理的，並用以形成我的意見，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣 authority 肩負其他資訊的責任。其他資訊包括香港貨幣管理局2017年年度報告內的所有資訊，除外財務報表及我的會計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不包括其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則顯得重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此事實。就此事而言，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 財政報告的貨幣當局及發行基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會責任\n\n貨幣管理局須按照香港會計師公會發行的香港財務報告準則及根據《發行基金條例》第7條由行政長官作出的指示，負責編製財務報表，以提供真實且公允的視圖，並為貨幣管理局認為必要以確保財務報表無重大錯報（無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致）而設立的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局應肩負評估集團是否有能力繼續作為持續經營企業的責任，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並使用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會的審計子委員會肩負監督集團財務報告程序的責任。\n\n# 會計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認整體財務報表在重大錯誤或舞弊的情況下是否沒有重大不正確，並發出包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並非保證按照會計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總是能發現已存在的重大不正確。不正確可能來自舞弊或錯誤，如果個別或整體而言，這些不正確可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決定，則會被視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計，我行使專業判斷並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：  \n- 識別並評估財務報表中重大誤報的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。因詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，因此未能察覺因詐欺導致的重大誤報的風險，較因錯誤導致的重大誤報為高；  \n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但此舉並非為對集團內部控制的成效發表意見；  \n- 評估貨幣當局所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及其會計估計及相關披露是否合理；  \n- 對貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生顯著懷疑的事件或狀況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，或若這些披露不充分，則須修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或狀況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營的實體；  \n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露情況，並評估財務報表是否以達到公平呈現的方式，反映背後的交易及事件；  \n- 取得有關集團內實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且適當的審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我對集團審計的指導、監督及執行負有責任。我單憑自身對審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我在與交易所基金顧問委員會的審計子委員會溝通時，會涉及其他事項，包括審計的預計範圍及時程，以及顯著的審計結果，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何顯著的內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會提供聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用情況下，提供相關保障。\n\n根據與交易所基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項，我釐定在審計當前期間財務報表時最具重要性的事項，因此這些是關鍵審計事項。我在審計師報告中說明這些事項，除非法律或規例禁止披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為不應在報告中說明該事項，因為披露該事項可能帶來的不利後果，合理地預期會超過披露該事項所帶來的公共利益利益。\n\n孫大卫\n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n貨幣管理局根據財政司頒授的權限，作為發行基金（該基金）的主管，按照《發行基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。該基金的主要職能是維持香港貨幣的兌換價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產被管理為四個投資組合：Backing Portfolio、Investment Portfolio、長期增長組合及戰略組合。Backing Portfolio 的資產與香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎完全匹配。Investment Portfolio 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合則持有私人股權及不動產投資。戰略組合則持有香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的戰略目的購入。運作範疇資訊載於附註 30。\n\n# 2 顯著會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係按照所有適用之香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個集體名稱，包括所有適用之個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港特許會計師學會（HKICPA）發行之解釋準則，以及香港公認之會計原則。基金及其子公司（以下合稱「集團」）採用之重大會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行若干新的及修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於現時會計期間首次生效或可提前採用。附註3提供有關這些發展首次採用所導致的會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並反映於這些財務報表中現時及前會計期間有關集團的變更情況。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司及合資公司的權益。集團主要子公司、聯營公司及合資公司的主要業務於附註16及17中所載。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除下列資產及負債按下列會計政策中所說明的公允價值列示外，其他均按歷史成本計量：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.11）；以及\n- 投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n根據 HKFRSs 編製財務報表需要管理層作出影響政策應用及資產、負債、收入及開支報告數額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設是根據經驗及多個其他因素作出，這些因素在當時情況下被認為是合理的，其結果成為作出有關資產及負債帳面價值判斷的基礎，而這些帳面價值並非來自其他資料來源。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及相關假設會持續進行檢討。若修訂僅影響特定期間，則會在該期間認可會計估計數字的修訂；若修訂同時影響現時及未來期間，則會在修訂期間及其後的未來期間內認可該修訂。\n\n附註18包含有關投資性不動產公允價值評估假設的資訊。附註36包含有關金融工具公允價值評估假設的資訊。除涉及這些公允價值評估的會計判斷外，於應用集團會計政策時，並無其他重要的會計判斷涉及。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司為集團所控制之實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而有權獲得浮動回報，或有權獲得浮動回報，且能透過其對該實體之控制權影響該回報。評估集團是否具備控制權時，僅考慮實質性權利（由集團及其他方所持有）。\n"}
