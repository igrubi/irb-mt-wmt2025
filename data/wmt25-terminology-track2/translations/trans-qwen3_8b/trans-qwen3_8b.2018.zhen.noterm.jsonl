{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","en":"# CEO Report\n\n2018 marks the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis. Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone significant transformations, with many scenes surpassing even the imagination of the best scriptwriters. In last year's annual report, I pointed out that the financial market performance in 2017 was \"unexpectedly positive,\" while also mentioning that \"underlying concerns\" remained. Looking back at 2018, it might be described as \"first joyful, then sorrowful.\" Following a record high for global stock indices in January, the euphoric investment sentiment quickly met the cold front of Sino-US trade tensions, along with ongoing Brexit negotiations, deteriorating geopolitical situations, and four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. These factors caused the optimistic market mood to rapidly reverse, leading to significant declines in asset prices throughout the year. The MSCI Global Index fell by as much as 20.3% from its peak to its trough, with an overall annual decline of about 10%, marking the worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index dropped by as much as 26.7% from its peak, with an annual decline of 13.6%, recording the largest annual drop in seven years.\n\n# Stable and Steady, the Foundation of Confidence\n\nDespite the unpredictable fluctuations in the external environment, the Hong Kong financial system has remained resilient, with the money market operating smoothly and without obstruction. The currency board system, which has been in place for 35 years, successfully withstood the test of capital outflows. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HKD 1 trillion worth of funds have flowed into the Hong Kong dollar. Last year, as the U.S. interest rates rose, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the U.S. continued to widen, leading to an increase in \"sell Hong Kong dollars, buy U.S. dollars\" arbitrage activities. As a result, the Hong Kong dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar at the beginning of the year. The \"weak side exchange guarantee\" established in 2005 was first triggered in April and was triggered a further 26 times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) carried out the \"buy Hong Kong dollars, sell U.S. dollars\" weak side exchange guarantee mechanism in an orderly and transparent manner, absorbing HKD 103.5 billion worth of Hong Kong dollar sell orders in the market. As capital flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) rose by 105 basis points during 2018. In addition, banks raised their prime lending rates after the U.S. interest rate hike in September last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and timely explained the operation mechanism of the \"weak side exchange guarantee\" through various channels to the public, helping the public understand that the outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar is an inevitable process of interest rate normalization in Hong Kong and also a normal operation of the currency board system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Hong Kong currency board system at the end of last year, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government also emphasized that the currency board is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary stability. These have all helped to stabilize the confidence of Hong Kong residents in the currency board exchange rate.\n\n# Banking System Steadies with Progress\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis exposed various underlying flaws and risks in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to implement a series of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including enhancing corporate governance and risk management in banking regulation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) focuses its bank supervision on two key areas: first, prudent supervision of banks' balance sheet risks, and second, banks' conduct and ethics, both of which are equally important. In terms of balance sheet risk supervision, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the Group of Twenty (G20), the HKMA has a responsibility to fully implement international regulatory standards, ensuring that the banking sector in Hong Kong operates in a sound and prudent manner. At the end of last year, the capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong banks reached 20.3%, which is significantly higher than the internationally required minimum of 8%, and also a marked improvement from the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. In the fourth quarter of last year, the average liquidity coverage ratio of major banks reached 167.6%, also well above the legally required minimum of 90%. At the same time, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the global financial crisis, where public funds had to be used to rescue \"too big to fail\" financial institutions, the Financial Stability Board has established international standards for financial institution resolution mechanisms. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that has fully implemented these standards. The HKMA's Resolution Mechanism Office is currently implementing the operational details of the mechanism, requiring banks to make structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when needed. Last year, the HKMA also introduced the \"Loss Absorbency Rules,\" and more related rules will be introduced in the future.\n\nGiven the continued rise in property prices, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority took preemptive measures, introducing eight rounds of countercyclical policies between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that the banking system in Hong Kong would have sufficient resilience to withstand shocks in the event of a reversal in the property market. These measures proved effective: the average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties fell from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018; the average debt-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. Bank credit growth this year was moderate at 4.4%, with overall asset quality remaining good, and the non-performing loan ratio in retail banking further declining to 0.5%, well below both international and local historical averages. Bank profitability continued to grow last year, with the overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%; several international banking groups achieved strong performance in Hong Kong, becoming significant contributors to their group profits.\n\n# Stable and Virtuous Culture: Leading by Example from Above, Following by Example from Below\n\nIn terms of regulating the conduct of banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Conduct Department in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To achieve both root and symptomatic improvements, in addition to setting various regulatory requirements targeting the fundamental conduct standards of bank operations, we have in recent years vigorously promoted reforms in bank culture. We encourage banks to foster a sound culture through governance, reward systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms, aiming to ensure that banks achieve top-down alignment internally, thereby restoring and enhancing customers' trust and respect in banks. Following the HKMA's provision of specific guidance to all banks in Hong Kong in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on bank culture at the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments on corporate culture and the implementation of related measures. These initiatives ensure the effective implementation of the three pillars of a sound bank culture.\n\nAlthough the Internet and mobile finance are global trends, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to promote financial inclusion last year, catering to communities that are unable to utilize new technologies. For example, we, together with the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, encouraged convenience stores to offer elderly customers the \"EasyPay\" cash withdrawal service without the need for shopping. The network of such convenience stores has now expanded to over 300 locations. We also contacted Hong Kong Post to introduce the \"Easy Withdrawal for the Elderly\" service at seven main post offices located in the outlying islands and New Territories. The banking sector has responded positively to the Monetary Authority's recommendations, actively increasing accessibility facilities and providing inclusive banking services for people with disabilities. One example is the number of ATMs with voice navigation, which has increased more than tenfold within a year to over 700 units. In addition, with the proactive efforts of the Monetary Authority, we expect that more physical branches and mobile banking services will be established in remote areas by banks in the near future, making banking more convenient for the public.\n\n# Smart Bank - A Revolutionary Experience\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely collaborates with banks and the technology sector. In September 2017, it launched the \"New Era of Smart Banking\" to promote the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong, offering citizens a brand-new experience in payment and banking services. The highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the official launch of \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) in September. As the world's only retail fast payment system, it broke down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, enabling citizens to enjoy 24\/7 instant transfers of Hong Kong dollars and Chinese yuan. At the same time, the HKMA also introduced the world's first \"shared QR code\" standard and application. Merchants can use a single QR code to connect to multiple electronic payment systems. Since its launch, \"FPS\" has been very popular among citizens. Within half a year, the number of registered users exceeded 2.58 million, with an average of 60,000 transactions per day, averaging HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 per transaction.\n\nIn May last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines for the licensing of virtual banks, and shortly after, 33 institutions submitted applications for virtual bank licenses. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have already been issued, and it is expected that they will officially commence operations within the year. Virtual banks will help promote the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong, provide individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises with new services and experiences, and promote financial inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released an Open Application Programming Interface (OpenAPI) framework in July. Banks will gradually open their product and service external interfaces in four stages, creating a more flexible and open financial technology environment. This will enable bank customers to more conveniently integrate account data, access information, and select services that best suit their needs. This year, a total of 42 new technology products have been tested using the HKMA's financial technology regulatory sandbox, of which 28 have completed trials. The related products and services have been successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe \"TradeLink\" trade financing platform, jointly developed by the Monetary Authority and several banks, was officially launched in October last year. This platform, which utilizes \"distributed ledger technology,\" is expected to enhance the efficiency of banks in approving trade financing. \"TradeLink\" is currently testing connections with relevant platforms in other regions to promote cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFinTech is not only widely applied in daily life but has also entered the compliance and regulatory domain in recent years. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages banks to use compliance technology (Regtech) to assist in handling routine operations, such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is studying the use of regulatory technology (Suptech) to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Strengthening and Enhancing Financial Strength\n\nThe competition among international financial centers is a contest of soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in the economic, social, and technological landscape, seize opportunities, and constantly open up new development spaces for Hong Kong's financial industry. Green finance represents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its bond and project financing markets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports and collaborates with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government in developing green finance. In addition to supporting the government's preparation for the issuance plan of HKD 100 billion in government green bonds, we held multiple green finance seminars last year, including two major international conferences, to enhance market understanding, awareness, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuing institutions to participate in the government's green bond grant scheme launched last year and the green finance certification service in Hong Kong. The amount of green bonds issued in Hong Kong last year exceeded USD 11 billion, which is more than three times that of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown increasing interest in infrastructure and related projects. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016, and its number of partners has since more than doubled to 95 institutions, making it an important platform for infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held its first high-level roundtable meeting with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council, discussing Hong Kong's unique advantages and role in supporting central state-owned enterprises' \"going global\" initiatives.

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","en":"# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the central banking institution of Hong Kong, with four main functions: maintaining monetary stability within the framework of the currency board system; promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); assisting in consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial center, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; and managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# The Legal Authority of the Monetary Authority\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly known as the Legislative Council) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly known as the Financial Secretary) to appoint the Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was then established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Commissioner of Financial Services are explicitly stipulated in the Currency and Foreign Exchanges Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Commissioner of Financial Services dated June 25, 2003, outlines the allocation of functions and responsibilities between them in monetary and financial matters, and also reveals that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Commissioner of Financial Services. This letter is a public document and can be accessed on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also utilize the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's position as an international financial center.\n\nThe Financial Secretary's appointed Financial Management Officer, under the Currency Fund Ordinance, assists the Financial Secretary in carrying out the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as other ordinances and functions assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Management Officer is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the Financial Management Officer is the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Services and Treasury Bureau exercises oversight and regulation of banking operations and deposit-taking activities in accordance with the Banking Ordinance. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau is responsible for the recognition of eligibility for licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance designates the Financial Services Secretary as the resolution authority for entities in the banking sector. The Ordinance confers a range of powers on the Financial Services Secretary to orderly resolve relevant entities, thereby reducing the risks posed to the stability and effective operation of the Hong Kong financial system by the unsustainable operations of such entities.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance confer upon the Financial Services Commissioner certain powers relating to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund activities.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance provides that the Commissioner of Financial Services may be conferred with the powers of inspection and investigation over the insurance business of banks.\n\nThe Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Financial Services Authority to supervise banks in complying with the provisions of the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers on the Financial Secretary the responsibility to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation to depositors of insolvent banks from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facility Instruments Ordinance, the Financial Secretary may designate and supervise settlement and clearing systems that are important for the stability of Hong Kong's currency or financial system, or for Hong Kong's role as an international financial center. The Ordinance also authorizes the Financial Secretary to manage the licensing regime for stored value facility instruments, and to designate retail payment systems and supervise whether such systems operate safely and efficiently.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government structure, but it may employ staff under terms of appointment different from those of civil servants to attract individuals with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its staff are all public officials. The day-to-day operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the legal authority conferred or delegated to the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives and the monetary system of Hong Kong. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Financial Secretary, it was stated that monetary stability should be maintained through the Currency Issuance Department system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Financial Secretary is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Chief Executive of the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the duties of the Financial Management Officer include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market\n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and operating such systems as appropriate\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help strengthen Hong Kong's international competitiveness in financial services.\n\nThe control of the Exchange Fund is vested in the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods used to implement government policy objectives, while also ensuring high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and supervising a sound and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial center and promoting the development of Hong Kong's economy.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority must gain public confidence to effectively carry out its duties. Therefore, it adopts a rigorous approach in fulfilling its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public, and strives to address issues of public concern that fall within its scope of responsibilities.\n\nThe Financial Secretary appoints the Financial Management Commissioner, so the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary; and since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. In addition, the HKMA is aware of its broader responsibilities, which include promoting public understanding of the HKMA's role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of public concern. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive contact with society, the HKMA adheres to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain an open approach. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA's work, taking into account market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality, and legal restrictions on disclosure;\n- To ensure that the HKMA stays attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, it publishes various bilingual (Chinese and English) journals and special publications. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features a dedicated section listing economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and presentation documents issued by the HKMA. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to enhance communication with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's offices have an information center, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, offering lectures and guided tours of the information center to explain the HKMA's functions to the public, particularly students, and to enhance citizens' financial knowledge. For detailed information on the HKMA's media engagement, publications, and public education activities, please refer to the \"Functions of the Authority\" chapter.\n\nThe number of times the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published accounts of the Exchange Fund and the Currency Issuance Department has been gradually increasing, with the content becoming more detailed. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) \"Data Reporting Special Standards\" program for central banks in 1999. It also publishes meeting minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Issuance Department. Since 1996, the HKMA website has also featured banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to providing briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council on the HKMA's various operations and policies three times a year, as well as answering relevant inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives will occasionally attend meetings of the Financial Affairs Committee and the Bills Committee of the Legislative Council to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Other Committees\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Advisory Council on Exchange Fund\n\nWhen the Financial Secretary exercises control over the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, he will seek the opinion of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority Advisory Committee was established under section 3(1) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Ordinance. This provision stipulates that the Financial Secretary must consult the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex officio Chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Advisory Committee, while other members (including the Financial Secretary's representative) are appointed by the Financial Secretary on behalf of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed based on their professional expertise and experience, which greatly benefits the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Advisory Committee. The professional expertise and experience of the members cover areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, business, and law.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized committees responsible for overseeing specific aspects of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's operations. These committees report and make recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. In 2018, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee held five meetings to discuss various matters related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, with most of these matters having been previously discussed by the relevant specialized committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and makes recommendations to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters such as the HKMA's remuneration and service conditions, human resources policies, financial budget, and administrative and governance affairs. In 2018, the committee held five meetings, covering topics including the HKMA's expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual salary review, and strategic planning. The committee also reviews the HKMA's regular work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's financial reporting process, evaluates whether its internal control systems are adequate and effective, and prepares reports. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the financial statements of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, preparing the components and accounting principles of such statements, and collaborating with both external and internal auditors to examine their audit scope and findings. None of the Audit Committee members hold any administrative positions within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. In 2018, the Committee held two meetings and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Monetary Authority monitors the operation of the Currency Issuance Department system and reports on this as a key pillar of the Hong Kong dollar's linked exchange rate system. The committee is responsible for ensuring the Currency Issuance Department system operates in accordance with established policies, making recommendations for improvements to the system, and ensuring the operation of the system maintains high transparency. The Monetary Authority regularly publishes the meeting records of the Monetary Council and the operational reports on the Currency Issuance Department system submitted to the committee. The committee held four meetings in 2018.\n"}

With the global economic growth slowing, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will also decelerate in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nThe Hong Kong economy continued to expand in 2018, but the annual growth rate gradually slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), leading to a decline in the annual growth rate from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected a slowdown in local demand growth and continued drag from net exports (Figure 1). Locally, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter but then lost momentum, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and the wealth-reducing effects of local asset price adjustments. Due to weak business confidence, overall investment spending also slowed. Externally, goods exports remained broadly stable in the first three quarters, but significantly declined in the fourth quarter as Sino-US trade tensions intensified. Goods imports also slowed due to weaker demand driven by exports. In contrast, service exports recorded faster annual growth, partly due to the strong performance of the tourism sector. Service imports were able to maintain growth momentum largely due to growth in transportation, business, and other services. On a net basis, the trade balance turned from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, which dragged down local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Category (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly change in the total amount of local fixed capital formation is not available.  \nData source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of components to the growth of real local生产总值  \nData source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Currency Situation\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar weakened throughout 2018, mainly due to carry trade activities driven by the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. In particular, the weak side intervention mechanism was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at the level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, in accordance with the Linked Exchange Rate System (LETS). According to the design of the LETS, the monetary base of the Hong Kong dollar consequently contracted, indicating a reduction in interbank liquidity. Combined with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, the overall Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) rose. As a result, following the upward adjustment of the US Federal Funds rate target range in late September, banks raised their prime lending rate by 12.5 to 25 basis points. In terms of credit growth, the overall increase in bank loans slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018, partly due to the slowdown in local economic growth and the weakening performance of external trade.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressure slightly increased in 2018. Excluding the impact of one-off government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate rose from 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, although it remained at a moderate level. The housing rental component saw a faster increase, reflecting the impact of earlier rises in private residential rents (Figure 2). A broader analysis showed that nominal labor costs and commercial property rents grew slightly faster, making local cost pressures more pronounced. As inflation rose in some major import sources for Hong Kong, import price inflation also increased accordingly.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market remained strong in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate decreased from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. The unemployment rates in most major service sectors also declined, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector, where the decline was more significant. With the continued increase in total employment numbers and private sector job vacancies, overall labor demand remained strong, and the labor force participation rate also rose slightly. Under the tightening labor market conditions, real wages and income further increased.\n\nFigure 3 Labor Market Conditions\nData Source: Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a significant reversal in 2018. Driven by strong upward momentum in 2017, the Hang Seng Index rose to a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, optimism in the market quickly reversed as concerns arose from the tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions, and the slowing local economic growth. By late October, the Hang Seng Index fell to a low of 24,586 points, and it closed at 25,846 points at the end of the year, representing a 13.6% decline compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the average daily trading volume increased from HK$88.2 billion in 2017 to HK$107.4 billion, and the total fundraising from initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong also rose significantly due to the listing of several companies involved in emerging and technology industries.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices  \nSource: Hong Kong Valuation and Rating Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nThe residential property market remained strong in the first half of 2018, but cooled down in the second half due to intensified Sino-US trade tensions, global stock market adjustments, and the rise in the most favorable interest rate in Hong Kong. Overall property prices fell by 9% from the peak between July and December, yet still recorded a 2% annual increase (Figure 4). Due to a significant decline in transaction activities in both the new and second-hand property markets during the second half of the year, the total number of property transactions in 2018 dropped by 7% to 57,247. Moreover, purchasing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and income leverage ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both well above long-term average levels. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, but slightly declined towards the end of the year. For the whole year, prices and rents continued to rise, while the rental yield remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nDue to the slowdown in global economic growth, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth will decelerate in 2019. Particularly, the external environment is fraught with challenges, and Hong Kong's export performance is likely to remain under pressure. Domestically, although the low unemployment rate and increased household income will continue to support private consumption, private consumption growth is expected to slow down partly due to weakened consumer confidence and the wealth-reducing effects from previous asset price adjustments. Regarding fixed capital formation, although housing supply increases are expected to lead to steady growth in construction and property activities, facing increased economic uncertainties, businesses may become more cautious about capital investment. The government forecasts that the real GDP growth rate of Hong Kong in 2019 will be between 2 and 3 percent, while the latest forecasts from private institutions average 2.3 percent.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nDue to the slowdown in global growth, including Hong Kong, external price pressures and local cost pressures are expected to ease, resulting in moderate inflation pressure remaining in 2019. The recent decline in newly signed residential rents will also exert a downward pressure on inflation. The market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 2.2% for 2019, while the government expects the basic inflation rate to be 2.5%. With continued economic growth and sustained popularity of the tourism industry, the labor market conditions are expected to remain tight. Private sector analysts predict that the unemployment rate will remain around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertain Factors and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2019 is influenced by uncertainties and risks such as trade tensions, the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, mainland China's economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical developments. Additionally, if these uncertainties intensify and persist for a prolonged period, financial market sentiment and business confidence may be significantly affected, leading to downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activities.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is influenced by numerous external and local factors, and its outlook remains uncertain. Externally, the uncertainty caused by trade tensions between China and the United States may affect market sentiment, economic outlook, and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over the property market in Hong Kong. Locally, although economic growth has slowed, employment conditions and income growth remain largely stable, which may support demand for residential properties. The trend of interest rates in Hong Kong to some extent depends on future changes in the U.S. policy interest rates, but the latter's direction remains unclear. In the long term, due to increased residential completions in recent years, combined with the government's efforts to increase land and housing supply, it is expected that the gap between housing supply and demand may narrow.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite increased external adverse factors such as the Sino-US trade conflict, Brexit, and interest rate normalization, which have intensified financial market volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained stable in 2018. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking system remained robust, and asset quality remained good. Rising interest rates widened interest margins, leading to a significant increase in bank profits.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nIn 2018, the banking system continued to grow steadily, with an expansion of the balance sheet by 5.9%. Facing ongoing uncertainties in the economy, such as trade conflicts between major economies and interest rate hikes, businesses became more cautious in obtaining new loans. The annual growth rate of total loans slowed to 4.4%, down from 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans used in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, trade financing declined by 7.6% due to the uncertain global trade environment. The growth in loans related to mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. Since most of these debt securities were investment-grade debt securities issued by governments and banks, the associated credit risk remained at a low level.\n\nFrom the perspective of the liability side, the total deposit amount increased by 5% in 2018, which was lower than the 8.7% increase in 2017. Due to expectations of continued interest rate hikes in the United States, some banks raised the interest rates on fixed deposits to attract depositors to shift their transaction and savings deposits into fixed deposits, thereby locking in funds. The proportion of transaction and savings deposits in the total deposit amount decreased from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% by the end of 2018, leading to an increase in funding costs. As the growth in total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% by the end of 2018 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking system has ample capital, indicating a strong buffer against potential shocks. The capital ratio has reached a historical high since the implementation of Basel III; the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6 Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered and Recognized Institutions\n\nThe leverage ratio under Basel III took effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based requirement aimed at limiting excessive leverage accumulation within the banking system. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, significantly higher than the legally mandated minimum of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Recognized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains stable, reflecting its strong capacity to effectively withstand shocks from potential financial and economic pressures. Regarding short-term liquidity (covering one-month funds), the average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 90% applicable in 2018. The average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 2 institutions remained at 54.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","en":"# Currency Stability\n\nIn 2018, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate generally rose, while the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate weakened and approached the weak side exchange rate guarantee level. Nevertheless, the foreign exchange and money markets in Hong Kong continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand strong shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the band of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts the currency issuance regime, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must provide at least 100% support to the money supply; if the money supply changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, fully matching any changes in the money supply.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of liabilities (which fully back the banknotes issued by the three issuing banks)\n- Circulating paper money and coins issued by the government\n- The total balance of settlement accounts held by banks at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balances)\n- Foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to the exchange guarantee. If the demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds its supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing the total reserves and lowering the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back down from the strong-side exchange guarantee rate to within the exchange band of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of the Hong Kong dollar, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing the total reserves and raising the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thus bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back up from the weak-side exchange guarantee rate to within the exchange band.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which has spurred carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee, which had been set at the 7.85 level since 2005, was first triggered. Throughout the year, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered a total of 27 times, with 13 triggers in April, 6 in May, and 8 in August. Despite this, the Hong Kong dollar market continued to operate smoothly. From mid-April to mid-September 2018, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated around the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.85 (Figure 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened, partly reflecting the tightening of interbank liquidity as holidays, quarter-end, and year-end approached, which led to the unwinding of some carry trade positions. At the same time, the Hong Kong dollar was also supported to some extent by the improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Market Exchange Rates in 2018\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side exchange guarantee, the total net assets and the aggregate amount of outstanding Hong Kong dollar notes and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) decreased from HKD 1,226.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the HKMA, in accordance with the design of the currency board system (the Linked Exchange Rate System), purchased a total of HKD 103.5 billion at the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 upon banks' requests. As a result, the total net assets decreased from HKD 179.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HKD 76.4 billion at the end of 2018. The aggregate amount of outstanding Hong Kong dollar notes and bonds issued by the HKMA remained largely unchanged during the year. The monetary base continues to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the total amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds was HK$113,620 billion.\n\nFigure 2: Summary of Total Reserves and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds in 2018\n\n# Money Market\n\nDue to the reduction in interbank liquidity following the triggering of the weak currency exchange guarantee and market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally rose throughout 2018. Short-term interbank offered rates experienced greater fluctuations, driven by increased funding demand related to new equity fundraising activities and seasonal liquidity needs (Figure 3). Overall, short-term interbank offered rates remained largely below the basic interest rate during 2018. In response to the rising cost of funds in the banking system, banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points after the U.S. Federal Funds target range was increased in late September.\n\nIn response to the four cumulative increases of 100 basis points in the target range of the Federal Funds rate within the year, which was raised from 1.25 to 1.50 percent to 2.25 to 2.50 percent, the basic interest rate was increased by a total of 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, raising it from 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. The adjustment of the basic interest rate was made according to the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of 50 basis points above the lower bound of the target range of the Federal Funds rate, or the average of the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate in 2018\n\nThe discount window lending increased from HKD 10.3 billion in 2017 to HKD 40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4: Forward Exchange Rate Points of the US Dollar against the Hong Kong Dollar in 2018\n\n# Exchange Rate Regime under the Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Exchange Rate Regime has been a crucial pillar in maintaining the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong since its implementation in 1983. It has demonstrated its ability to withstand strong shocks during multiple regional and global financial crises. Due to the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee, which is part of the Exchange Rate Regime design, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August. Capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable process in the normalization of Hong Kong interest rates, and also a normal operation under the Exchange Rate Regime. To enhance public understanding of the operational mechanisms and technical details of the Exchange Rate Regime, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been actively explaining the regime to the public and demonstrating the resilience of Hong Kong's financial system in responding to shocks. The government remains resolute in maintaining the Exchange Rate Regime. The stability of the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces public confidence in the government's commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of exchange and store of value. During the 2018 Fourth Review with the International Monetary Fund, the IMF reaffirmed its support for the Exchange Rate Regime and stated that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, serving as a pillar of stability that helps ensure sustained economic growth, maintain competitiveness, and facilitate the smooth operation of the large financial services sector.\n\nGiven that a sound banking system plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the currency board system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. It also maintains regulation over banks' corporate, property-related, and mainland-related loans to ensure the banking system has the capacity to withstand shocks. Banks hold a large amount of bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which can be used through the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate fluctuations. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also prepared to provide additional liquidity by adjusting the issuance of bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in the event of a sudden and severe outflow of Hong Kong dollars. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also reminds the public to manage market and interest rate risks prudently and to be prepared for potential market volatility.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's foreign exchange reserves has been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio was 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 5). Under the currency board system, although certain assets of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all assets of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The substantial financial resources of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority provide a strong backing to safeguard the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5 Daily Variation of Support Ratio in 2018\n\n# Monetary Policy Committee\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Financial System Oversight Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2018, the MPC examined topics including the potential impact of coordinated exits from unconventional monetary policies by multiple central banks on the supply of dollar loans to offshore banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of Hong Kong dollar money demand, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical framework of the currency board system since the implementation of three optimization measures. The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings and the HKMA's submitted reports on the operation of the Monetary Authority system are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Financial Research (the Institute) continues to support research work in monetary policy, banking, and the financial sector. Over the past four years, the Institute has placed greater emphasis on policy-related research, as evidenced by the seminars and visiting scholar programs it has organized. On one hand, the Institute has collaborated with major central banks and policy research institutions to hold more seminars on policy-related topics. On the other hand, in 2016, it launched the Special Research Scholar Program to support more research projects related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's policy-making.\n\nIn 2018, the Research Center invited a total of 16 researchers and published 25 research papers. Throughout the year, the Research Center also hosted four international seminars:\n- The \"9th Annual International Seminar on China's Economy,\" held in January, with the theme \"China's Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.\" The seminar was jointly organized by the Research Center, the Market Economy Research Institute of the State Council Development Research Center, and the Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China. It focused on topics and risks related to the mainland's real estate market.\n- The \"Seminar on Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Framework,\" held in October, jointly organized by the Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements. The seminar was one of the celebratory events marking the 20th anniversary of the Bank for International Settlements' Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong, aiming to explore the role of exchange rates within the monetary policy framework.\n- The \"Annual Seminar on the Microstructure of Financial Markets in Central Banks,\" held in November. The seminar discussed theoretical research on financial market microstructure, empirical research findings, and policy implications related to recent developments.\n- The \"China Experts' Seminar on the New Era of China's Economy,\" held in November, jointly organized by the Monetary Authority, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve System.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\n\nDespite increased uncertainties in the global economy and financial markets, the Hong Kong banking system remained stable in 2018. The effectiveness of liquidity and credit risk management systems of authorized institutions continued to be a key focus of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) during the year. In view of the ongoing rise in cyber threats and the broader adoption of financial technology by the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of technology risk management and business continuity capabilities of authorized institutions. In May, the HKMA issued a revised version of the \"Guidelines on the Authorization of Virtual Banks\" and began processing applications for virtual bank authorization. In terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA took further measures to strengthen oversight of authorized institutions' practices in selling investment and insurance products, promote accessible banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become more complex and globalized, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to enhance Hong Kong's capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through the adoption of new technologies and risk-based approaches. The Authority has made satisfactory progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large risk exposure limits. In addition, the Authority has strengthened communication and engagement with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strive to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism for authorized institutions, including introducing rules on minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to address a major obstacle facing the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this objective, it is essential to establish and maintain a financial system with high resilience that can provide the necessary critical financial services for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system due to their operational practices, or even in extreme cases, due to disorderly collapses. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau plays an important role in ensuring financial stability by ensuring that banks are capable of withstanding shocks, responding to crises, and recovering to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent collapses. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as licensing and regulating authorized institutions in Hong Kong, including licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau also oversees the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Financial Secretary cannot guarantee that the financial system is entirely free of risks, and Hong Kong's prudent regulatory regime is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution mechanisms, the Financial Secretary aims to ensure that, once an authorized institution is no longer viable, its collapse can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Financial Secretary serves as the resolution authority for a number of financial institutions, including authorized institutions. To establish an efficient Hong Kong resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the operational capacity of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to resolve non-viable authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the aforementioned tasks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority needs to adopt methods that are consistent with and coordinated with international practices.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2018, the HKMA conducted a total of 187 on-site inspections, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL rating of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, risk management, and the business strategies of authorized institutions in response to the development of financial technology. To further enhance the risk management standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards of directors or board committees of authorized institutions, and followed up on the progress of authorized institutions in implementing corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continues to conduct regular on-site inspections and complements them with thematic assessments to examine areas deemed to be of higher risk. During the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 392 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, with credit risk management remaining the main focus of the reviews and assessments. Other key areas included technology risk and operational risk management, as well as measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments on liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Special review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' businesses related to securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) matters.\n\nTable 1 presents a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's supervisory work in 2018.\n\n# Supervision of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with total loan amount increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slower growth in loans was mainly due to the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment, leading to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2 Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of related loans in the mainland increased by 1.4% to HKD 424.9 billion at the end of 2018, which was lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Growth in Domestic-related Loans\n\nThe asset quality of the authorized institutions remained stable in 2018. The specific classified loan ratio for retail banking decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, significantly below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the specific classified loan ratio for the entire banking sector declined from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding loans related to the mainland, the specific classified loan ratio for retail banking decreased from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the relevant ratio for the entire banking sector also fell from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nWithin the year, the Monetary Authority strengthened its supervision to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the Monetary Authority actively investigated the backgrounds and structures of large enterprises, thereby enhancing the monitoring system for corporate credit risks. Additionally, the Monetary Authority conducted special assessments focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management for large enterprise loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management for property developers' loans, secured loans, and loan collateralized by policies.\n\n# Mortgage Loan for Property\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018, but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced since October 2009 have enhanced the Hong Kong banking system's ability to withstand potential reversals in the local property market. The average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages dropped from 64% in September 2009, before the first round of countercyclical measures, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt service-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the relevant ceiling was first introduced, to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Mortgage Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio for Newly Constructed Residential Mortgages\n\n# Supervision of Operational and Technology Risks\n\nThe technology-related risks faced by the banking sector remain relatively high. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced the \"Cybersecurity Assessment Framework\" in 2016. The first phase implementation plan covered 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks, which have completed three stages of assessment: self-assessment of risk levels, maturity assessment, and (if applicable) risk-led cyber attack and defense simulation tests. These assessments have helped authorized institutions identify areas requiring improvement and take remedial actions to enhance their cybersecurity defenses. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also established a timetable for the second and third phases of implementation, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. This year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted on-site reviews, focusing on the cybersecurity controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance of authorized institutions.\n\n# Smart Bank\n\nThe HKMA continues to work with the banking sector to implement the seven measures promoting smart banking, which were announced in September 2017, in order to promote the development of financial technology in Hong Kong. On the regulatory front, the HKMA issued a revised version of the \"Guidelines on the Recognition of Virtual Banks\" in May. In addition, under the \"Banking Easy\" initiative, the HKMA has simplified the regulatory requirements related to remote account opening, online loans, and online wealth management. These optimized regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking user experience. In September, the scope of the \"Banking Easy\" initiative was expanded to promote the adoption of financial compliance technology (Regtech) by banks. Among the three new focus areas are: (1) compliance technology for monitoring money laundering and terrorist financing, (2) compliance technology for prudential risk management and compliance, and (3) \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements.\n\nMr. Man Kuet Hung, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech titled \"Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018\" hosted by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\n\n# Regulation of Liquidity and Market Risks\n\nAs the U.S. monetary policy continues to normalize, the Authority has strengthened its supervision of liquidity risk to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. This year, the Authority conducted a round of thematic assessments to evaluate the preparedness of authorized institutions for potential tightening of dollar liquidity and their capacity to conduct internal liquidity stress tests. In addition, the Authority has monitored compliance by authorized institutions with the \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" requirement, which came into effect in January.\n\nThe HKMA not only reviews the market risk management of authorized institutions' bond portfolios but also conducted a special on-site inspection on the margin and risk mitigation standards under the Global Foreign Exchange Code and non-central clearing over-the-counter derivatives, to examine the extent to which authorized institutions comply with the new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nThe Government's \"Risk Assessment Report on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in Hong Kong,\" published in April, pointed out that the Hong Kong banking system faces high money laundering threats, similar to other international financial centers, reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threats facing Hong Kong come not only from local criminal activities but, to a greater extent, from overseas activities. These overseas activities include illicit proceeds from corruption abroad, fraudulent activities by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions, stemming from Hong Kong's status as a payment and trade hub. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Government has formulated a policy statement on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, outlining responses to these threats. The objective is to enhance the system's capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing while also attracting and facilitating legitimate business activities.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 came into effect on March 1, introducing amendments that provide flexibility in verifying customer identities to accommodate the development of technology-enabled customer onboarding by authorized institutions. The new legislation also broadens the scope of application, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to take responsibility for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby comprehensively strengthening the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. These amendments, together with the amendments to the Companies Ordinance aimed at enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership of companies, will assist authorized institutions in carrying out their work against money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTo strengthen and further enhance communication with authorized institutions on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies and supervisory approaches, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued in October a new section titled \"Supervisory Approach to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing\" under the \"Regulatory Policy Manual,\" as well as the updated \"Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (for Authorized Institutions)\" in line with relevant legislative amendments. This aims to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce obstacles for authorized institutions in adopting new technologies to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes.\n\nThe role of information exchange in combating money laundering and terrorist financing has become increasingly important. With the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Bankers' Association), the banking sector has actively participated in the Financial Intelligence Unit Task Force (Task Force) on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, achieving substantial results. A review of the Task Force's pilot program was initiated at the end of 2018 and is expected to be completed in early 2019.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nStrengthening Hong Kong's position as an international financial center is one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's main responsibilities. Seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors have made good progress this year, with a notable example being the successful launch of the fast payment system \"FPS (hongbao).\"\n\nThe initiative for enhanced connectivity between China's mainland and Hong Kong capital markets, along with the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, has further strengthened Hong Kong's unique position as a gateway to China's mainland. Hong Kong's status as an offshore RMB business hub has also become more solidified, with vibrant RMB financial activities in the city.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centers, and the green bond market. The Authority has also intensified its market promotion initiatives to publicize Hong Kong's advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders. On the international level, the Authority plays a leading role in various regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong's professional expertise and commitment in relevant international matters.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong's position as a financial technology hub in Asia, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been actively implementing the seven measures announced in September 2017, aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors. The main progress achieved during the year in the seven initiatives to advance smart banking includes:\n\n- Successfully launched the fast payment system \"Zhangshu Kuai\", fully connecting with different banks and value-added payment tools (collectively referred to as \"e-wallets\")  \n- Released the framework for open application programming interfaces (open API) in the banking industry and promoted the implementation of open API across the sector;  \n- Enhanced research on financial technology and talent training;  \n- Strengthened cross-border cooperation in financial technology;  \n- Revised the \"Guidelines on the Recognition of Virtual Banks\" and processed virtual bank license applications;  \n- The upgraded version of the \"Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox\" (FSS 2.0) is operating smoothly; and  \n- Expanded \"Banking Easy\" to promote the adoption of financial compliance technology by banks.\n\nThe Financial Services and Treasury Bureau's Financial Technology Promotion Office (FFO), together with the bureau's various banking departments, plays an important role in promoting and implementing the aforementioned measures.\n\nWith the implementation of optimized measures under the cross-border capital market connectivity initiatives between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's unique position as a key gateway to mainland China has been further strengthened. The \"Bond Connect\" program has fully adopted the real-time gross settlement (DvP) settlement mechanism, and the State Council has announced tax exemption arrangements for overseas investors investing in China's domestic bond market, further enhancing the program's efficiency and appeal. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also closely collaborated with mainland authorities to explore and implement various financial supporting measures, facilitating individuals and businesses living, working, and operating in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA). Offshore RMB business in Hong Kong continues to thrive, with the total RMB deposit funds pool increasing by 6% year-on-year to 657.7 billion RMB; the average daily transaction volume of the RMB real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system reached a high level of 10,101 billion RMB.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively explores new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong's bond market, the Authority has implemented the \"Bond Grant Pilot Scheme\" proposed in the Budget, providing grants to institutions issuing bonds for the first time in Hong Kong. It has also closely collaborated with the government to revise relevant legislation, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the \"Qualifying Debt Instruments Scheme.\" In addition, the Authority has intensified market promotion activities, promoting Hong Kong's advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organizing various large-scale and specialized outreach events to position Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centers.\n\nAt the international level, the Monetary Authority leads multiple regional and international committees. The Monetary Authority is currently serving as the chair of the Committee on Banking Supervision under the Financial Stability Board, the Regulatory and Implementation Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe secure and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure forms a solid foundation for Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. In 2018, four RTGS systems handling bank interbank transactions, the Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU System), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Repository) achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. The CMU System continued to assist in settling \"Bond Connect\" Northbound transactions through accounts with two central securities depositories in mainland China, and also held mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU System members.\n\nTo promote the overall security and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designated two more retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"), subjecting them to HKMA supervision. As a result, the number of designated retail payment systems under HKMA supervision has increased to six. The HKMA also exercises regulatory oversight over 16 licensed stored value facility operators. These licensed operators actively launch new products and services, striving to offer customers more choices and a better user experience. Meanwhile, the scope of electronic cheques and electronic bill and payment services has further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Hong Kong as the Financial Technology Hub of Asia\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nThe HKMA announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017, aiming to help the banking sector reach a higher level and seize the significant opportunities brought by the integration of banking and technology. Throughout the year, the HKMA has made good progress in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong's financial ecosystem.\n\n# \"Fast turnover\"\n\n\"Fast Transfer\" was successfully launched in September, enabling banks and value-added payment tool users to make real-time interbank transfers of Hong Kong dollars and RMB anytime and anywhere. Users only need to enter the recipient's mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 value-added payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with real-time payment services and\/or account binding services.\n\n\"Fast processing\" has received over 20 million registrations within 3.5 months, equivalent to 27% of Hong Kong's population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 48 million transactions, involving a total amount of more than 104.9 billion Hong Kong dollars and 2.75 billion yuan.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Common QR Code Standard and the related mobile application \"Hong Kong Common QR Code\" (HKQR) in the same month. It is the world's first mobile application that integrates multiple QR codes into a single comprehensive QR code, making it convenient for businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to accept payment solutions from different payment service providers using the same QR code, without having to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API refers to the practice of opening up a bank's relevant data to third-party service providers, enabling better and more convenient integration of banking services with those of other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services in a secure environment through a single system. To promote the development and provision of open APIs in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority released an Open API framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based approach and implements various Open API functions in four stages. As of the end of January 2019, approximately 500 Open API interfaces in the first stage had been opened by 20 banks, covering data on more than 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Research and Talent Training\n\nA trade financing platform named \"TradeLink\" was launched in October by an alliance of several Hong Kong banks, based on the results of a trade financing concept validation led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks through digital trade documents and automated trade financing processes. By the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined the alliance. In October, \"TradeLink\" signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade financing platform \"we.trade\" to conduct a concept validation integration between the two platforms. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also simultaneously explored opportunities for \"TradeLink\" to connect with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the \"Global Trade Connect Network.\"\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), at the launch ceremony of \"Trade Linkage\".\n\nTo cultivate more fintech professionals, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the upgraded \"Fintech Talent Development Program\" (FCAS 2.0) in January in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). FCAS 2.0 consists of four programs suitable for young talents at different career development stages. Over 200 students have benefited from the program.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the left), Mr. Lam Ka-lik, Chairman of Digital Harbour (first from the left), Mr. Wang Ming-sin, Chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Applied Sciences (second from the right), and Mr. Huang Ke-qiang, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (first from the right) attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony.\n\n# Cross-border Collaboration\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government Financial Development Service Office (Shenzhen Financial Office) in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continued to strengthen its collaboration with Shenzhen in financial technology. This includes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's sponsorship of the \"Shenzhen Financial Technology Summer Internship Program,\" which allows 50 students to undertake a six-week internship at several well-known companies in Shenzhen, experiencing the local financial technology ecosystem. Additionally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority co-organized the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Financial Technology Innovation Awards\" for the second time with the Shenzhen Financial Office.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Governor of the Monetary Authority (second from the right), is talking with the first batch of Shenzhen Financial Technology Summer Interns.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech cooperation agreements with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Central Bank of Brazil in 2018 to promote fintech collaboration.\n\nIn August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related organizations, launched the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" initiative. This network aims to provide innovative companies with more effective ways to interact with regulatory authorities and to promote cooperation among regulatory bodies on issues related to innovation.\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nIntroducing virtual banks will bring new momentum to Hong Kong's fintech applications and offer digital bank customers a fresh experience. As virtual banks target retail customers such as individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, they will also help promote financial inclusion. Following public consultations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued the revised \"Guidelines on the Recognition of Virtual Banks\" in May and received about 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox\n\nThe usage of the sandbox has steadily increased throughout the year. To help establish an ecosystem for financial compliance technology, the sandbox was opened to financial compliance technology projects starting in September.\n\nBy the end of 2018, a total of 42 financial technology or technological products had been approved to undergo testing through the sandbox, of which 28 had completed their trials and the related products had subsequently been launched to the market. The Authority also received 220 cases seeking to use the \"Financial Technology Regulatory Chatroom\" to obtain regulatory feedback at the early stage of fintech project development. Approximately 70% of these cases came from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2018 was a challenging year for investors, as the investment environment was troubled by various risk factors, including the tightening of financial conditions caused by the continued normalization of U.S. interest rates, the escalation of trade frictions among major economies, and the rise of populism and increased geopolitical risks in various parts of the world. Global stock markets generally declined, and U.S. Treasury yields rose along with the four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. With U.S. interest rates rising, the dollar strengthened. Some emerging markets faced severe political and economic pressures domestically, leading to significant depreciation of their currencies. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund still recorded HK$10.9 billion in investment income in 2018.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's position as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary and the delegated authority.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) Ensuring capital preservation;  \n(b) Ensuring that the entire monetary base is always fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;  \n(c) Ensuring sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) Striving to maximize investment returns, in accordance with the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the composition structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the support portfolio and the investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid dollar assets that provide full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency issuance regime. The investment portfolio mainly invests in the bond and stock markets of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, to ensure the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo more effectively manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is prudently and gradually diversifying a portion of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Foreign Exchange Fund, plus the total amount of deposits in the Future Fund and the affiliated companies of the Foreign Exchange Fund that are linked to the long-term growth portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance is not included in the Exchange Fund's performance evaluation.\n\n# Deposits with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for the Future Fund. The interest rate for deposits in the Future Fund is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the allocation between the two portfolios. At the end of 2018, the allocation of the Future Fund between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation refers to the asset allocation reflected in the investment benchmark, which indicates the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline to carry out tactical asset allocation in order to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual allocation and the benchmark allocation is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limit after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the allowable range of tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can hold positions within the allowable range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office in August, tasked with the specialized functions of investment and related risk management. The office's staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Foreign Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. These investment portfolios are invested in global fixed-income markets, and the macro risk management strategies of the Foreign Exchange Fund are implemented through derivative instruments.\n\n# Outsourced Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 28% of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets, including all equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market to invest in the Foreign Exchange Fund, thereby achieving sustainable returns and benefiting from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as gaining access to market expertise and professional investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year and are mainly influenced by market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management is highlighted. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for both internal and externally hired investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The Authority has also strengthened risk assessment to align with the growing diversification of the Foreign Exchange Fund's investments; it also employs risk control tools to evaluate market risks under normal and extremely adverse market conditions. Additionally, the Authority conducts detailed analysis of investment performance factors to identify the causes behind different performance outcomes, thereby assessing how to fully leverage the investment management expertise of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" published by the Securities and Futures Ordinance Committee. These principles aim to assist investors in determining the best ways to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in investing in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance factors, applicable to the selection, appointment, and supervision of external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios are required to adhere to the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" when managing such investments. Overall, the HKMA has incorporated environmental, social, and governance factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA closely monitors the development of relevant standards on environmental, social, and governance factors and evaluates how these standards can be further integrated into investment processes. In addition, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to promote business and investment decisions based on long-term goals.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, various risk factors that had previously been underestimated by the market began to emerge, including the pace of U.S. interest rate normalization, the impact of U.S. government trade policies and protectionism on global trade, and geopolitical risks. As a result, global financial markets experienced significant volatility and adjustments.\n\nThe escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China has caused significant concern among investors. Emerging markets and Hong Kong's stock markets have been repeatedly declining since early February, with the Hang Seng Index falling as much as 27% from its peak in that month. Starting from the fourth quarter, major European and American stock markets also experienced substantial declines, recording double-digit percentage drops. For the entire year of 2018, global stock markets generally declined, with the MSCI Global Index, which covers developed market stocks, dropping by 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index also falling by 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose broadly in 2018 due to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy. However, the bond market still experienced fluctuations during the year. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose from around 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November, but softened to 2.7% by year-end, influenced by investors' concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute and a shift toward more conservative investments.\n\nIn the money market, the dollar strengthened throughout the year as it followed the U.S. interest rate hikes. The U.S. dollar index rose by 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and the Chinese yuan declined against the dollar by about 5%. Additionally, some emerging markets experienced further currency depreciation due to domestic political and economic instability. For example, the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira fell by about 50% and 30% respectively against the dollar. In contrast, the yen appreciated by 2.7% against the dollar, driven by demand for safe-haven investments.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1 Market Returns in 2018\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded HKD 10.9 billion in investment income in 2018, which included HKD 57.4 billion in bond investment returns, HKD 2.07 billion loss from Hong Kong stock investments, HKD 3.87 billion loss from other stock investments, HKD 9 billion loss from foreign currency valuation adjustments on non-HKD assets, and HKD 2.19 billion in other investment returns from the Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a HKD 500 million valuation loss.\n\nBy the end of 2018, the total value of the Fund's assets reached HKD 405.49 billion. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was HKD 28.36 billion, comprising HKD 19.11 billion in private equity and HKD 9.25 billion in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment was HKD 20.24 billion.\n\nThe investment return rate of the Exchange Fund (excluding strategic asset portfolio) in 2018 was 0.3%, with the portfolio's return rate at -2.4% and the support portfolio at 2.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.9% since it started investing in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 displays the investment return rates of the Exchange Fund in 2018 and the average investment return rates for different periods.

In 2018, the Authority organized 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 64 other public activities. In addition, 39 media interviews were arranged, and 462 bilingual press releases were issued.

The topics covered include a variety of themes such as the currency board system (HKD-USD linkage mechanism), financial technology development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the Authority launched an official Facebook page in July to further leverage social media for enhanced communication with the public.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), and the Environmental Bureau's mascot \"Da Laogui\" jointly promoted the use of \"Welcome Banknotes\" for giving red envelopes through social media.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe Public Inquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's main functions and operations. In 2018, a total of 9,950 inquiries were handled, with approximately half relating to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, and notes and coins, particularly the Coin Collection Scheme, banking products and services, guidelines and announcements related to the banking sector, the fast payment system \"FPS\", virtual banking, and the 2018 Hong Kong New Banknotes Series.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2015, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Queries\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2018 Categorized by Nature\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report, the Authority published two semi-annual reports on the monetary and financial stability situation and four quarterly reports in 2018.

The first batch of 50 open API data sets was successfully launched in July, covering areas most frequently accessed by the public, such as statistical data on the banking system and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and cash-in-transit vehicle schedules. The remaining 80 data sets will be rolled out in phases before the middle of 2019. To further facilitate public access to the latest news and information about the HKMA on the website, the HKMA is currently comprehensively revising the website's design and content to make it more user-friendly. The newly redesigned website is expected to be launched within 2019.\n\nThe HKMA actively promotes the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of Two IFC, introducing the public to the functions of the Monetary Authority and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre consists of two parts: an exhibition hall and a library. It is open to the public for six days a week.

It also provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe Currency Exhibition Hall at the Information Center introduces the design, anti-counterfeiting features, production process, and other interesting facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. The exhibition hall underwent a renovation in the first quarter of 2018, incorporating various interactive elements, such as educational games that make learning fun. Visitors can not only gain knowledge about Hong Kong currency but also enjoy the experience. In addition, a new artistic Bauhinia tree was added to the exhibition hall. It is made up of 2,018 transparent cubic blocks crafted from shredded banknotes that are no longer suitable for circulation. It complements another mosaic artwork in the exhibition hall, which is made from Hong Kong coins. The newly renovated Currency Exhibition Hall reopened on August 16.\n\nThe Information Center provides guided tours for visitors.

As a public institution, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continuously streamlines its work processes to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It is committed to maintaining a lean and flexible organizational structure and strives to implement new measures and cope with increasing workloads by optimally utilizing its existing workforce.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is an employer that provides equal employment opportunities and ensures that employees can work in an environment free from discrimination. The Authority's equal opportunity policy applies to recruitment, compensation and benefits, performance evaluation, promotion, transfer\/training opportunities, and general conduct.\n\nThe HKMA employs, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work requirements. The HKMA requires its staff to maintain a high level of integrity and ethical standards, always adhering to strict personal conduct and integrity norms, and always acting in the best interests of the HKMA.\n\n# Key Human Resources Data as of January 1, 2019\n\n# Organizational Structure Changes in 2018\n\nThe Office of the Fund Management was established on August 1st, taking over the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserve Management Department and the Risk Management and Supervision Department. The establishment of the Office of the Fund Management highlights the authority's investment functions, enhances its institutional image, and enables more flexible responses to market changes, thereby supporting the ongoing expansion and diversification of the Fund's investment activities.\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing establishment and actual number of staff of the Monetary Authority by department.\n\nTable 1: Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staffing Structure and Actual Number of Employees as of January 1, 2019\n\nThe employee responsible for monitoring investment risks is part of the organization structure of the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office, and is consolidated under the Risk Management and Oversight Department here to facilitate the presentation of their job functions.\n\n# Salary and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary seeks the views of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Board of Directors through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and considers market salary levels and practices to determine the salaries and service conditions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's staff. The salary package includes cash compensation and a provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash compensation consists of a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a performance-based lump-sum payment issued annually according to the staff member's work performance.\n\nWhen the Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees annually, they seek advice from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Board of Directors through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. This advice takes into account the Board's evaluation of the HKMA's performance over the past year, the results of a salary survey in the financial sector conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. Individual employees with outstanding work performance may also receive special adjustments to their salaries to maintain their competitiveness in the market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority allocates the approved amounts used to adjust annual fixed and variable salaries based on individual employees' performance. The variable salary system for employees responsible for investments is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. For fixed salary adjustments and variable salary disbursements of senior management and above, the Financial Secretary approves them after consulting the Governance Committee, and such employees will not attend meetings discussing their salary proposals. For fixed salary adjustments and variable salary disbursements of staff at the managerial level and below, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority decides based on the Financial Secretary's authorization and in accordance with the approved lump sum for salary payments.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 lists the compensation data of senior management in 2018.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual compensation received by employees with less than one year of service is calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual compensation for the respective position.  \n2. The number of staff listed in this table includes employees with less than one year of service. The number of senior officials of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority includes the Chairman of the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, the Commissioner of the Resolution Mechanism Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Fund Investment Office.  \n3.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019 年 4 月 4 日\n","en":"# Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n- Report by the Audit Commission Chairman\n- Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Audit Office Director's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nThis certificate confirms that I have audited the financial statements of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), as listed from pages 167 to 273. These financial statements include the balance sheets of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Group as at December 31, 2018, the income statements, comprehensive income statements, equity change statements, and cash flow statements for the period ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements have truly and fairly presented, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, the financial position of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Group as at 31 December 2018, and their results and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Office. The responsibilities I have undertaken in relation to the audit of the financial statements are set out in the section \"Responsibilities of the Auditor in Auditing Financial Statements\" of this report. In accordance with these standards, I have maintained independence from the group and fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, are most significant for the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I considered these matters in the audit and formation of my opinion on the entire financial statements, and I will not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Fair Value Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 36,935.89 billion, while financial liabilities amounted to HKD 11,338.29 billion.\n\nThe fair value of 93% of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities is either based on quoted prices for the same assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or is estimated using valuation techniques, with the inputs used being based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of such financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The total amount of these financial assets is HKD 275.631 billion, mainly comprising non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amount involved and the estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\n- Understand the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluate and test monitoring measures, including application-level monitoring measures for computer systems;\n- Obtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- If market quotations are used, verify the prices based on independent sources;\n- If the parameters used in the valuation methods are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters based on independent sources; and\n- If the parameters used in the valuation methods are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate, and assess whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 20, and 21 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HK$25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also holds interests in 3 joint ventures and 20 associate companies, which mainly engage in holding overseas investment properties. The aggregate value of these interests amounts to HK$44.336 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether directly held by the Group or by joint ventures or associate companies, are primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports of investment properties held directly by the Group or by joint ventures or co-operative enterprises, and verify that fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for all other information. Other information includes all the information in the Financial Management Authority's 2018 annual report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not issue any form of attestation conclusion on other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read the other information, in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances known to me during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I conclude that the other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Secretary and the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the financial statements\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing financial statements that are true and fair in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The Financial Management Officer must also implement the internal controls that they consider necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Management Officer must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and disclosing matters related to the going concern in applicable cases, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# Responsibilities of Auditors in Auditing Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material misstatements if, individually or in aggregate, they are likely to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk that financial statements may contain material misstatements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, falsification, intentional omission, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;\nUnderstand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls;\nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the financial management officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;\nDetermine whether the financial management officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are significant uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that significant uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I would issue an auditor's report with a non-unqualified opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may lead to the group's inability to continue as a going concern;\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events;\nObtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any major deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Review Committee under the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, stating that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating with them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures, where applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated to me by the Review Committee under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most significant for the audit of the current financial statements, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless disclosure of a particular matter is prohibited by law or regulation, or in extremely rare circumstances, where I determine that the adverse consequences of communicating the matter in my report would outweigh the public interest, and therefore decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nAuditor General\nChu Nai Zhang\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
