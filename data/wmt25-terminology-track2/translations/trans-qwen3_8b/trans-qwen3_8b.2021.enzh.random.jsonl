{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over

行政長官聲明\n\n2021年是同時進行整固與發展的一年。\n\n2021年，疫情在未見緩和的情況下進入第二年：全球供應鏈受到干擾，通貨膨脹壓力持續上升，全球金融條件過早收緊的風險增加。 加上新型冠狀病毒變異株的出現以及地緣政治緊張關係的升溫，不確定性進一步增加。 儘管如此，我們仍繼續保障貨幣與金融穩定，並維持運營韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來對復甦的希望，隨著多個經濟體推出寬鬆的貨幣及財政政策，成功推出新型冠狀病毒疫苗。全球經濟開始從2020年的嚴重收縮中復甦。本地方面，香港經濟在經歷2019年及2020年的經濟收縮後，於2021年增長6.3%，受惠於疫苗接種計劃的推行及政府的疫情纾困措施，這些措施為我們的經濟復甦提供了至關重要的支持。\n\n在財政及貨幣穩定，以及宏觀環境趨於穩定的情況下，2021年為我們提供了更多空間，以推動更多發展工作。我們把握機會，推動了有助於我們金融業保持高度競爭力的發展計劃。在我們三大戰略重點，即金融科技、綠色金融及香港作為門戶角色所產生的內地市場機會方面，已取得顯著進展。\n\n我們踏入2022年時，全球環境變得更加艱難。但有云：「當事情變得艱難時，真正強韌的人才能迎難而上。」我們將繼續主動積極，追求我們的發展目標與重點，以更好地應對下一步的挑戰，並鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦會堅定不移地履行承諾，確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩健，正如我們在過去多次應對各種挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基礎\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港金融體系的強大支柱，並有助香港抵禦無數衝擊和挑戰。儘管持續存在有關新型冠狀病毒疫情的不確定性及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮，香港貨幣市場及外匯市場全年的運作仍保持有序，反映聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n對我們體系的信心並非一朝一夕便可建立，而是以多年來穩健建立的基礎為基礎。在2021年《外資部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，LERS的可信度已得到保障，這是因為有一套透明的規則、充裕的財政與外匯儲備、強健的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系，以及謹慎的財政框架。\n\n信心亦來自我們在公眾及市場溝通方面的努力，以及有效的監測。在後者方面，我們借助科技與數據分析，加強了我們對金融穩定及宏觀審慎監測進行更及時且全面分析的能力。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。疫情爆發兩年後，我們的銀行仍然表現良好，流動性及資本充足率按國際標準而言均屬優異。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足率高達20.2%，遠高於最低要求的8%；而在2021年第四季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋率平均為151.9%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。儘管疫情下信貸環境充滿挑戰，但銀行業的資產質素在該年度大致保持穩定。行業的貸款分類比率在2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自2000年起的長期歷史平均值1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的重要支撐支柱\n\n一如往常，銀行業一直是經濟活動的重要支撐。面對新型冠狀病毒疫情所造成的經濟後果，這一點尤為至關重要。過去一年，主要的挑戰在於在銀行業內管理信貸風險與維持銀行業對實體經濟支持之間取得平衡。憑藉多年來的監管工作，銀行持續有效地管理信貸風險。同時，我們與銀行緊密合作，透過預批核本金寬限期計劃（PPPHS）及其他緩解措施，為企業及個人客戶提供迫切所需的緩解措施。PPPHS於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制一同推出，讓符合資格的企業客戶可在預批核的基礎上將貸款本金償還期限延長六個月。2021年，該計劃再次延長兩次，直至2022年4月，鑑於某些經濟部門仍因持續的疫情而經營環境艱難，並需要進一步的信貸緩解。其後，鑑於本地新型冠狀病毒感染出現反彈，2022年2月，PPPHS進一步延長至2022年底。看到銀行業與香港金融管理局攜手協助企業及個人借款人緩解資金週轉壓力，即使銀行業本身因疫情爆發而面臨困難的營運環境，這仍是令人鼓舞的。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境外，疫情也帶來了更困難的營運環境以及持續增加的網絡威脅所形成的數位環境。我們加強了努力，以提升銀行業的營運及網絡韌性，以及消費者與投資者保護，這是在數位化不斷增加及網路釣魚詐欺案件急升的情況下進行的。特別是，銀行業做法守則已修訂，以提升數位金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n此外，我們致力於推動銀行業的金融包容性及以客戶為中心的文化。增強有需要客戶對銀行服務的方便使用，一直是我們的工作重點，我們一直與業界緊密合作，制訂行業指引。繼就無障礙銀行服務及為智障人士提供銀行服務的指引後，業界在2021年12月，獲香港金融管理局支持，發出一份指引，說明銀行業為失智症患者及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則及良好實踐。\n\n為支持銀行業在未來持續發展，面對新興的增長機會與挑戰，需要從工作人員身上獲得一套新的技能，香港金融管理局已制定了一項全面的人才發展策略 —— 「聯繫人才，迎接未來」，以培育未來人才，並以更系統及專項的方式提升現有從業人員的技能。我們的新策略以三個「聯繫」方向為基礎：聯繫學生與銀行業、聯繫從業人員與銀行業的未來，以及聯繫關鍵持份者，以加強合作，推動策略的實施。我們已推出一系列的推廣及宣傳活動，以吸引更多學生進入銀行業。為更好地準備大學學生成為「未來準備就緒」的人才，我們與香港銀行學會聯同推出了「未來銀行橋接計劃」，該計劃包括一系列課程，涵蓋實用的銀行知識及高度需求的軟技能。對於現有銀行從業人員，我們一直緊密與業界合作，透過提供更多受歡迎的培訓課程，創造提升技能的機會。2021年12月，銀行從業人員的加強能力框架下的新金融科技模組已正式推出。\n\n財務人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與所有持份者攜手合作，鑑於加強人才儲備，以促進行業的進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強大的地位，支撐於無可比擬的機會接觸能力\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，是由其提供無可比擬的機會所支撐。各界普遍達成共識，認為全球金融科技的應用、內地金融市場的開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的主流化，為香港金融業的未來發展帶來巨大機遇。在香港金融管理局，我們致力於利用香港獨特的優勢，把握這些機會。讓我先介紹金融科技及內地的機遇。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情清楚地顯示了金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的態度。為確保我們持續保持全球金融科技領域的領先地位，並準備好挖掘金融科技的所有潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，使所有層面及所有群體的人都能體驗到金融科技的價值。\n\n此願景促使我們制定了一項新戰略「金融科技2025」，於2021年6月揭曉。正如其名稱所顯示，該戰略旨在協助金融業在2025年前全面應用科技。此戰略包括五個重點範疇，涵蓋實現成功生態系統所需的要素，亦包括生態系統進一步增長所需的正確因素，形成生生不息的循環。該戰略的首兩個部分，即「所有銀行進行金融科技」及「為央行數字貨幣（CBDCs）加深研究香港」，主要目的是創造更多金融科技應用的需求。戰略的其他部分則與數據、基礎建設、人才及資金有關，這些是生態系統增長的關鍵要素。\n\n根據此策略，已推出多項新舉措，例如廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA）金融科技試點設施，讓金融機構和科技公司能夠進行試點測試，並盡早從監管機構和用戶獲得有關跨境金融科技舉措的回饋；以及商業數據交換的試點推出，該舉措利用替代數據以促進中小企業融資。我們亦加強了對 Wholesale CBDC 在跨境支付中應用的研究，並探討電子港元（e-HKD）的前景，這將有助香港在採納 CBDC 方面提升準備程度，從而未來-proof 我們城市的金融基礎設施，以應對未來數十年的挑戰。\n\n雖然我們把握科技進步帶來的新機會，我們亦繼續鞏固現有的成果，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，於2018年推出的即時支付系統（FPS），在過去幾年內迅速發展，截至2021年底，登記數目已達960萬，較上年度上升40%。2021年的平均每日交易量亦較2020年上升90%，達到約673,000筆即時交易。另一方面，鑑於加密資產，特別是用作支付用途的穩定幣迅速發展，我們今年初已發佈討論文件，邀請市場就建立合適的監管框架提供回饋意見。\n\n我們的新、具前瞻性的策略將為金融科技生態系統的健康發展奠定基礎。隨著銀行業日益採納金融科技以把握其提供的機會，這最終將同時惠及金融機構及香港市民，並加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港為主導內地的門戶\n\n香港一如既往在聯繫內地市場與國際金融市場方面發揮戰略作用，為國際投資者提供一個熟悉的制度及平台，以進行各種類型的金融、投資及資產管理活動。國家「十四五」規劃強化了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務中心，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。此與全球經濟趨勢一同加強了我們對香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場橋樑之獨特價值的信心。\n\n2021年，我們在提升聯繫方面達成一個里程碑，推出了兩項新方案，即廣東粵港澳大灣區內的跨境財富管理通證（跨境WMC）計劃，以及債券通下的南向交易，本質上完善了在包括股票、債券及財富管理等廣泛金融市場範疇內雙向互通的循環。這兩項方案的推出將為香港帶來各方面的新機會。透過滿足內地投資者日益增加的多元化需求，這兩項方案將擴大我們債券市場及財富管理行業的客戶基礎。我很高興看到這兩項方案運作順利。香港金融管理局將繼續與內地當局保持聯繫，以期隨時間推移進一步增強這些方案。\n"}

摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n2021年，香港經濟在強勁商品出口的支持下恢復正增長，帶動內地需求並受政府支持性政策措施推動，經濟出現回升。勞動市場亦改善，雖然通脹微升，但仍然保持溫和。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩定，資本及流動性狀況良好。資產質素按歷史及國際標準而言皆維持健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港美元市場繼續以暢順有序的方式運作，儘管持續存在有關新型冠狀病毒疫情的不確定性及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮。聯繫匯率制度亦繼續良好運作。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑，發行基金錄得投資收入港元1,919億，相當於投資報酬率4.1%。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推動負責任投資及資產多元化的工作。長遠增長組合自2009年啟動以來，錄得年化內部報酬率為15.4%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續重點放在銀行風險管理的監管上。鑑於持續增加的網絡威脅及加快的數位化發展，香港金融管理局已加強對銀行運營及網絡韌性的監管。銀行做法亦已修訂，以提升數位金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n經廣泛諮詢後，廣東–香港–澳門大灣區跨境財富管理通關（跨境WMC）試點計劃已順利推出。香港金融管理局提供指引，協助銀行以提供良好客戶體驗的方式，透過非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，同時確保保障。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，香港金融管理局的首要工作重點是進一步加強銀行預防及偵測與疫情期間網絡金融犯罪上升相關的非法資金流動之能力。香港金融管理局亦透過公私合作夥伴關係深化資訊共享，同時支持遠端客戶開戶流程，並透過推出首個AML科技實驗室，鼓勵採用其他科技，包括網絡分析技術。\n\n在軟性基礎建設方面也作出進一步努力，包括銀行文化與人才發展範疇。\n\n本地在實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率及披露方面的要求。香港金融管理局亦持續推進建立解決方案標準的工作，進行解決方案規劃及發展解決方案執行能力，以確保銀行具公信力的解決方案機制。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局公布其「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融業廣泛應用金融科技，並加強香港在亞洲金融科技中心的地位。在更快支付系統方面，其登記數目及交易額已顯著增長，應用層面亦持續擴大。\n\n在增強聯繫方面，跨境債券通及債券通南向交易已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的角色。\n\n亦致力於締造新商務機會，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心，以及綠色及可持續金融等範疇。\n\n為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強與各種持份者的市場接觸，讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所提供的機遇。香港財務學院亦推出一個新財務領袖計劃，旨在培育香港未來的財務領袖。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated

2022年及前瞻重點\n\n全球及本地情況在進入2022年時明顯惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級及美國聯邦儲備局加息預期觸發市場波動；另一方面，本地經濟受到新型冠狀病毒疫情新一波爆發的衝擊。不過，鑑於香港金融體系具備多年建立的韌性及緩衝能力，其財務體系仍能良好抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，香港金融管理局會繼續高度重視維持貨幣及金融穩定。為此，我們會努力預先識別新興風險，並以靈活應變的方式作出回應，以保持領先優勢。同時，香港金融管理局亦會尋求有助鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心地位的機會。在這複雜的投資環境下管理貨幣發行基金，香港金融管理局會繼續審慎投資，同時保持靈活，適時實施防禦措施，並維持高度流動性。\n\n# 財務體系的穩定與健全\n\n全球經濟展望仍受制於重大不確定性。香港金融管理局將持續關注最新發展，並警惕潛在風險，以維持金融系統的韌性和穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警覺以應對潛力風險\n\n展望未來，市場可能受制於更高的波動性，隨着各種領域的不確定性上升。一方面，美國聯邦儲備系統的貨幣政策正常化，若以較快步伐持續進行，可能提前顯著 tighten 全球金融條件，並增加全球債務償還負擔。另一方面，繼2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級後，包括中美關係緊張在內的地緣政治不確定性可能持續保持高水準，並再次引發金融市場波動。最後但同樣重要的是，隨著疫情發展不斷變化，有可能出現下行風險情境，即在大規模範圍內重新實施封鎖措施，導致全球供應瓶頸持續存在，並對全球經濟增長和通脹產生負面影響。然而，鑑於香港金融體系多年來建立的韌性和緩衝能力，香港的金融體系應能良好抵禦不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦有能力建立資源和承擔責任，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局會繼續緊密監察本地及國際環境中的風險及弱點，並在必要時準備就緒，採取合適措施以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。2022年的研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的問題，並評估其潛在風險。另一方面，香港金融管理局持續進行的數字化計劃將協助提升其監察能力，以支持更全面的監察及對金融體系的綜合分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n隨著發達市場收緊貨幣政策，且疫情的影響持續存在，銀行業所面對的信貸環境預期將持續充滿挑戰。同時，迅速的科技進步與數位化亦為銀行業帶來機會與挑戰。面對不斷變化的金融環境，香港金融管理局致力於透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力。同時，香港金融管理局亦會繼續提升及完善其銀行監管及政策框架，並考慮國際標準及最佳實踐做法。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將加強監察銀行的信貸風險敞口，並推行主動措施以確保整體風險層面保持良好可控。\n\n金管局亦會繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業營運情況的影響，同時在保持各種紓困措施的檢討下，與銀行及商業界保持緊密對話。\n\n# 運營及科技風險\n\n2022年5月，香港金融管理局（金管局）發佈了新的監管政策手冊（SPM）模塊「業務韌性」，金管局將繼續與業界保持聯繫，了解獲授權機構（AIs）在發展其業務韌性框架方面的進展。同時，金管局將尋求提升銀行業的網絡韌性，透過跟進AIs在 Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 評估中所揭示的問題，並監察AIs實施安全三重資料備份的情況。另一個重要的監管重點將是評估及處理AIs對科技服務供應商越來越大的依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉加強的數位能力及在疫情期間累積的廣泛遠距工作經驗，一些人工智能正計劃在業務照常進行的基礎上，轉向混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將會讓軌道此發展，並評估是否相關風險已獲得行業充分處理。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n香港金融管理局將於2022年重點監察人工智能的流動性及市場風險管理。特別地，香港金融管理局將繼續監察人工智能在過渡期內，於2023年6月30日前餘下倫敦銀行同业拆借利率（LIBOR）設置停止發出前的進展。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐融資\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的工作將繼續聚焦於透過合作及資訊分享，加強對詐騙及金融犯罪的應對，並投身與AML\/CFT生態系統內各種持份者更緊密的合作。其他重點包括實施更廣大的風險敏感監管技術，透過利用加強的數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，並推動銀行使用監管科技（Regtech），包括交易監測系統。\n\n香港金融管理局亦會繼續與政府、銀行業及儲值支付工具發牌機構緊密合作，新增一份更新的香港洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估報告，並協助業界應對新興風險。有關工作亦會繼續進行，以了解反覆出現的洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險，實施反洗錢法律及相關指引的變更，以配合國際標準，並維持與其他監管機構及國際標準制定機構的主動交流。\n\n# 資產管理及相關強制性公積金業務\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將對與財富管理及證券發售、強制性公積金（MPF）及其他投資及保險產品有關的AI行為進行現場審查及非現場監察，重點關注廣東–香港–澳門大灣區的跨境財富管理通關（跨境WMC）計劃、數字建議平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資連結長期人壽保險產品。\n\n在與其他監管機構及銀行業界保持緊密聯繫的同時，香港金融管理局將就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售所涉及的監管標準提供進一步指引。此指引將涵蓋多方面內容，包括與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及出售保障聯繫計劃，這是一種新興的投資聯繫保障計劃產品，具有高水平的保險保障。香港金融管理局、保險業監管局及強積金計劃管理局將聯同推出一個神秘顧客計劃，用以評估中介機構在有關符合資格延期年金保單及稅務扣減自願供款方面的銷售實踐。\n\n以下推出跨境WMC後，香港金融管理局將繼續參與行業及相關監管當局，以提升該計劃。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局將展開準備工作，以監管人工智能的信託業務，並採用新的SPM模組及新的做法準則。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n香港金融管理局會繼續根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）1 及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的各種指引，推動其監管範疇內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全與效率。同時，會根據最新的科技及市場發展情況，調整金融市場基礎設施監管框架。\n\n香港金融管理局將與財務市場機構合作，確保遵守《金融機構監管標準》(PFMI)，並適時進行及更新評估。此外，香港金融管理局將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO PFMI實施監測與評估工作。香港金融管理局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並因應市場及科技發展情況，加強其監管要求，並與國際慣例保持一致。香港金融管理局將與相關當局合作，在適當情況下進一步加強協調監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局會繼續提升及完善其銀行監管及政策框架，並考慮國際標準及最佳實踐。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續提升資本框架，以落實巴塞爾銀行監督委員會近年發出的標準，包括以下內容：\n\n2013年12月銀行對基金的股本投資資本要求（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日起生效，並配合2022年銀行（資本）（修訂）規則在立法會負面審查後開始運作。\n\n2017年12月 Basel III 最終化後危機改革所制定的修訂資本標準、2019年1月最低市場風險資本要求（於2019年2月修訂）、以及2020年7月針對信用價值調整風險架構的專項修訂， collectively referred to as 「Basel III 最終改革套件」。這些修訂資本標準說明了對信用風險、市場風險、信用價值調整（CVA）風險及操作風險的修訂資本處理方式，引入了輸出地板要求，並提升槓桿比率架構。銀行（資本）規則（BCR）的修訂條文正與業界進行諮詢，以期於2023年7月1日起生效，作為最低要求（除市場風險及CVA風險外）。\n\n鑑於BCR下對主權集中風險的處理係旨在補充巴塞爾委員會的大型 exposures 框架，並已由銀行（ exposures 限額）規則所實施，香港金融管理局將同時提出對資本規則的修訂，並配合銀行（ exposures 限額）規則的相關變更。\n\n# 暴露限值\n\n香港金融管理局會繼續就建議修訂《銀行 (風險敞口上限) 规則》與業界及司法部門進行諮詢，目標實施日期與巴塞爾 III 最終改革套件的日期相符，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露準則\n\n新或修訂的披露要求，與巴塞爾 III 最終改革方案中修訂的資本標準相關，主要載於《第三支柱三十三披露要求 – 更新框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》，分別由巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月發出。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《槓桿比率披露要求修訂》，修訂披露要求以應對有關潛力「粉飾」（即銀行在報告日期附近減少某些交易的規模，以人工提高其槓桿比率，用作報告及公眾披露）的憂慮。為實施這些新或修訂的披露要求，亦正準備相應的《銀行（披露）規則》修訂，並預期這些修訂能在香港沿著與其相關修訂資本標準相同的時序生效。\n\n# 其他監督政策與風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求及國際標準的發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）計劃更新某些壓力測試模型（SPM）模組，包括與實施巴塞爾 III 最終修訂方案中有關資本及披露標準相關的模組，例如「逆周期資本緩衝 – 實施方法」、「銀行賬簿中的利率風險」、「新股份認購及股份孖展融資」及「壓力測試」。 HKMA 亦會繼續處理有關「行為準則」及「根據銀行條例有關獲授權機構外部審計師的報告要求」的修訂 SPM 模組，目標是在 2022 年內完成修訂。由於擬議對《銀行（風險敞口上限）規則》的修訂，相關的行為準則及 SPM 模組，例如 CR-G-8「重大風險敞口及風險集中」及 CR-G-9「對關聯方的風險敞口」，將會 accordingly 進行更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart

經濟與金融環境\n\n在強勁的貨品出口、內需回升以及政府支持性政策措施的推動下，香港經濟於2021年恢復正增長，逆轉了2019年和2020年所經歷的收縮。勞動市場亦有所改善，通脹仍然溫和，雖然略有上升。雖然預期經濟復甦在新型冠狀病毒第五波減退後會繼續，但其強度和速度受制於不確定性和風險，尤其與疫情以及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑有關。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 實際活動\n\n由於強勁的貨品出口及內需改善，香港經濟在2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年及2020年的經濟收縮（表1及圖1）。私人消費復甦，受惠於勞動市場情況改善及政府消費補貼計劃的推動。整體投資開支亦出現反彈，反映營商環境及展望改善。在外圍方面，香港整年貨品出口錄得強勁增長，主要受惠於全球經濟復甦持續。服務業出口錄得溫和增長，反映活躍的區域貿易及貨運流量，以及更強的跨境商業及金融活動。總進口上升顯著，主要由於更大內需及轉口帶動的需求。以淨額計算，2021年外部貿易對實質本地生產總值（GDP）增長帶來支持（圖1），因總出口增長較進口更快。\n\n表

物價膨脹\n\n通脹壓力微升但仍然溫和。剔除政府一次性纾困措施的影響後，整體年同比基礎通脹率在12月逐步上升至輕微的1.4%（圖2）。外出用餐、交通、服裝及衣履等消費項目價格重拾上升動力，因本地消費需求改善。同時，國際能源及商品價格急升，加上全球供應鏈瓶頸，亦導致進口價格顯著上升。相對而言，住宅價格成分則拖累整體通脹，反映應屆私人住宅租金較早前下跌的影響（圖2）。更廣泛而言，名義工資及商業租金的緩慢增長有助維持國內企業成本壓力。整體而言，2021年的基礎及 headline 通脹率分別維持在0.6%及1.6%。\n\n圖2 隱含消費者物價通脹  \n來源：統計處\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，勞動市場在2021年有所改善。在2月達到17年來最高點7.2%之後，失業率明顯下跌至12月的4.0%（圖3），且下跌情況橫跨大多數經濟部門。整體勞動需求逐步轉強，反映在總就業人數（圖3）及私人部門空缺數的增加上，儘管它們仍低於疫情爆發前的高峰。另一方面，勞動人口較去年同期略微減少1.3%，部分由於勞動參與率溫和下降。名義工資與勞動所得的年增率雖然溫和，但在2021年的前三個季度出現加速跡象，反轉了2019及2020年期間放緩的趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況\n來源：統計處\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在全年大致表現呆滯，儘管一些主要海外股市持續上漲（圖4）。在2020年底持續反彈的基礎上，恆生指數於2021年2月17日升至31,085點的高點，但自那之後，市場情緒由於眾多因素而急轉負面，包括對新出現的新型冠狀病毒變種的憂慮、主要央行潛在的貨幣政策收緊，以及透過港股通南向交易的資金流入減少。恆生指數全年收報23,398點，較去年同期顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n圖 4 資產價格  \n資料來源：評級及估值部門及香港交易所有限公司。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2021年上半年隨着更好的經濟前景重拾上升動力，但下半年則因資產市場氣氛轉弱而出現整固（圖4）。整體而言，2021年住宅物業價格及交易量仍分別上升3.7%及24.1%。家庭負擔能力亦變得更偏緊，部分反映家庭收入減少。另一方面，經歷了2019年及2020年的顯著調整後，非住宅物業市場一般出現改善，工業物業價格及租金普遍上升至疫情爆發前的高峰，而零售及辦公室物業價格則仍低於其 respective 峰值。\n\n見表B：主要經濟指標，頁326至327，以取得更多細節，包括其在2017至2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，本地新型冠狀病毒感染第五波疫情對本港經濟活動造成壓力。為因應此情況，政府推出2022–23預算內的第五及第六輪抗疫基金，以及增加的逆周期措施，以協助支持經濟。香港金融管理局亦與銀行界一同將預批准本金償還假期計劃延長至2022年10月底。\n\n2022年整體經濟復甦預期將繼續，雖然與2021年相比步伐較為溫和，部分反映第五波新冠肺炎疫情的影響、全球經濟成長放緩、較弱的基礎效應以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年實質本地生產總值增長幅度將在1至2%之間，而國際機構與私人部門分析員最新預測的增長率平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的強度與步伐受制於眾多不確定性與風險，尤其與疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑有關。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n\n隨著進口價格上升及疫情引發的物流中斷，通貨膨脹壓力預期在近期内將略微上升，但由於租金疲軟及輕微的本地勞動成本壓力，應能大致維持在可控範圍內。市場共識預測2022年的 headline 通貨膨脹率為2.4%，而政府預測 headline 及核心通貨膨脹率分別為2.1%及2.0%。本地新型冠狀病毒第五波感染於2022年初對勞動市場造成壓力，尤其對勞動密集型行業影響尤甚。進一步而言，勞動市場情況將取決於疫情發展及國內經濟復甦的步伐。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年繼續保持穩定。總銀行資產以貸款及存款上升為基礎，實現了適度擴大。銀行業的資本及流動性地位仍然良好。資產質素維持在歷史及國際標準所認可的健康水平。\n\n# 權責發生基礎的財務報表趨勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2021年增長了1.9%。由於經濟復甦，全年貸款增長了3.8%，相比2020年的1.2%。其中，用於香港的貸款增長了4.4%，用於境外的貸款增長了1.1%，貿易融資則上升了14.2%。與內地相關的貸款在2021年擴大了3.6%，在2020年則大致穩定。\n\n在負債方，2021年總存款上升4.6%，較2020年的5.4%為快。由於總存款增幅較總貸款增幅為快，整體貸款對存款比率微升至2021年底的71.8%，較一年前的72.3%下降（圖5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行業的貸款及存款  \n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業仍保持良好資本充足。本地註冊的授權機構（AIs）合併總資本比率於2021年底高達20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖6）。兩項比率均遠高於其 respective 國際最低要求的8%和6%。\n\n2021年底巴塞爾三號資本充足率為7.9%，遠高於法定最低要求的3%（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性地位良好。2021年第四季度，第1類機構8的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為151.9%。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的25%（圖8）。\n\n圖 8 指定發牌機構的流動性比率\n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n銀行業的資金來源仍然穩定。2021年底，第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低要求的100%。核心資金\n\n類別2A機構的風險權數比率（CFR）於2021年底為150.3%，亦良好高於法定最低要求的75%（圖9）。\n\n圖9 指定發牌機構的資金比率\n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n#

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管持續存在的新型冠狀病毒肺炎疫情不確定性及對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮上升，香港貨幣市場及資金市場仍繼續以暢順有序的方式進行交易。自1983年實施以來，作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度展現出其應對外部衝擊的強大韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。所謂貨幣穩定，是指香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在港元7.75至7.85兌1美元的區間內。貨幣制度的結構主要採用貨幣發行局制度，需要貨幣基礎至少有100%由存放在發行基金內的美元儲備支持，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全配合。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表 1）包括：\n\n債務證書，其提供全面支持予三家發行銀行所發行的紙幣；政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；總結餘額，即存於香港金融管理局的結算帳戶的餘額總和；以及香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發行基金票據及紙幣（EFBNs）。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅決履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾來維持的。當HKMA準備就緒，在銀行要求下，以每美元7.75或7.85的兌換率，買入或賣出香港美元以換取美元時，若強方或弱方CUs被觸發，總結餘額將擴大或收縮，以促使香港美元利率下降或上升，協助香港美元恢復在7.75至7.85的兌換區內。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 經濟穩定\n\n由於股本相關需求因融資活動及港股通而產生，香港貨幣年初時維持在強方兌換保證區附近。其後，香港貨幣因股市回調及部分新上市公司回購首次公開發行（IPO）資金而轉弱，但在第二季因企業派息需求及港股通淨流入而略為回升。踏入年下半年，雖然香港貨幣因股市情緒回軟而微跌，但主要維持在強方兌換保證區，並繼續以暢順有序的方式進行交易（圖1）。整體而言，香港貨幣兌換市場在2021年運作正常。\n\n圖1 2021年市場匯率\n\n隨著CUs未被觸發，2021年（圖2）總結算餘額及未償還EFBNs總額仍維持在約港幣15,263十億水平，幾乎沒有大變動。當年，香港金融管理局為應對銀行系統流動性充裕情況下銀行對發行交換基金紙幣的持續需求，發行總額為港幣80十億的額外交換基金債券，導致總結算餘額從2020年底的港幣457.5十億收縮至2021年底的港幣377.5十億。\n\n反映按既定做法增發發行基金債券及發行外匯發行債券以吸納外匯發行債券的利息支付，本財政年度外匯發行債券的發行額由港幣一千零六十九點二億元上升至港幣一千一百四十八點八億元。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 港元15,263十億\n\n總總餘額及未結清的EFBNs\n\n圖2 總結餘額（折扣窗口前）及2021年發行的發行基金紙幣餘額\n\n# 財務市場\n\n在龐大的總結餘額支持下，香港美元銀行同业拆息整體在低水平保持大致穩定（圖3）。雖然首個季度因首次公開發行活動增加，對港元的需求上升，但各種期限的香港銀行同业拆息（HIBORs）波動不大。其後，HIBORs 仍然大致穩定，儘管有對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮。至2021年底，HIBORs 有輕微上升，部分反映預期年底的資金需求。在零售方面，銀行維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的資金市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗口貸款額由2020年的港元91十億下降至2021年的港元68十億。\n\n圖3 2021年香港美元銀行間利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）已成為香港金融體系的強大支柱逾三十年，並展現出其強大及應對挑戰的能力。儘管全球經濟復甦仍存在持續的不確定性，香港貨幣市場及外匯市場繼續以有序的方式運作，反映LERS的穩健性。政府堅決致力於LERS。在2021年《外資部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，LERS的可信度已透過一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系及謹慎的財政框架而得到保障。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續順利營運，流動性狀況及資本充足率在國際標準下表現良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管工作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的發行基金資產配置用以支持貨幣基礎。在2021年，後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.8%至110.5%範圍內波動，未觸及上或下觸發水平。該比率在12月31日收報110.2%（圖4）。根據LERS，雖然已指定特定發行基金資產用以支持後備組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。發行基金充裕的財政資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2021年每日支持比率變動\n\n# 貨幣委員會子委員會\n\n香港金融管理局發行基金顧問委員會的貨幣發行委員會（CBC）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2021年，CBC探討了若干問題，包括對美國通脹情況的評估、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估緊縮政策風暴的風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解與內地相關的資金流動對香港貨幣狀況的影響。CBC就這些問題進行討論的記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，已發出至香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n2021年底，發行紙幣的發行銀行所發行紙幣的總值為港元5,926十億，較上年上升5.9%（圖5、圖6及圖7）。2021年底，政府發行紙幣及硬幣的總值為港元129十億，較上年上升1.7%（圖8及圖9）。\n\n# 港元5,926十億，+5.9%\n\n發行附註銀行紙幣總價值\n\n# 港元129十億，+1.7%\n\n政府發行紙幣及硬幣的總價值\n\n# 圖

硬幣收數計劃\n\n硬幣收數計劃繼續受到公眾的良好歡迎。有關該計劃的更多資料載於第198頁的可持續性章節。\n\n# 交易所基金票據及紙幣\n\nEFBN計劃繼續順利營運。為滿足銀行在銀行體系流動性充裕情況下對發票的持續需求，香港金融管理局於2021年下半年發行了總額為港幣800億港元的額外發票。額外發行導致總結餘出現相應減少。2021年底，未償發票的名義金額高達港幣1,1486十億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 交換基金票據及証件的突出問題\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究所以（HKIMR）在持續的疫情下，於2021年維持穩定的研究產出。當年，HKIMR發布了30篇工作論文，並舉辦了九場網上研討會，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行穩定性、市場微結構及金融科技（金融科技）發展等廣泛主題。HKIMR亦舉辦了一場國際會議及一場混合模式的網上研討會。\n\n題為「人民幣匯率形成機制及匯率展望」的網上研討會於8月17日由香港財經學院合辦，並在多個網上平台進行直播，吸引總觀看量逾1.16百萬人次。\n\n第11屆年度國際中國經濟會議，題為「邁向共同富裕：雙循環下的中國經濟發展」，於11月11日舉行。會議討論了與共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷規範、房地產市場、跨境財富管理聯繫及大灣區金融發展相關的最新政策動向。專家演講者亦深入分析了人口老化的影響及社會保障基金的可持續性，以及中國對全球金融穩定與世界經濟的貢獻。會議共設六個不同主題的會場，吸引超過3,200名線上及現場觀眾，總觀看量達5,900次。\n\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2021年仍然保持穩健及穩定，儘管出現了更具傳播力的新型冠狀病毒變種，造成全球經濟復甦的不確定性。當年，香港金融管理局繼續重點放在 authorised 機構的風險管理監管上。鑑於銀行業持續增加的網絡威脅及加快的數位化，亦加強了對 authorised 機構運營及網絡韌性的監管。\n\n關於行為監管，香港金融管理局提供指引，促進銀行使用非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，制定市場上新產品的監管要求，例如與保險相關的證券及虛擬資產。銀行業行為準則亦已修訂，以提升數碼金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）領域，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的工作重點一直是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中的龍門角色及其預防和偵測與疫情期間網絡詐騙、中轉帳戶網絡及其他金融罪案相關非法資金流動的能力。為提升客戶帳戶對詐騙及金融罪案的防護，香港金融管理局透過公私合作模式，加強與其他持份者之間的協作及資訊分享。在支持遠距客戶開戶的同時，香港金融管理局亦鼓勵採用其他科技，包括網絡分析技術，並於11月推出首個AML科技實驗室。國際上，香港金融管理局透過主動參與，持續保持在全球金融行動特別任務組（FATF）AML\/CFT工作中的領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，廣東－香港－澳門大灣區跨境財富管理通脹試點計劃於9月順利推出。 本年內，香港金融管理局繼續執行其推動香港 adopting Regtech 的兩年路線圖。 若干措施已推出，以奠定銀行機構氣候風險管理的基礎，並推動綠色及可持續銀行發展，如在可持續發展章節中所討論。 同時亦在軟性基礎設施方面作出更多努力，包括推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業界合作推出能力建設措施，以促進人才發展。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策及程序。在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率及披露方面的標準。香港金融管理局繼續推進其工作，以確保獲授權機構具公信力的解決機制，包括發展新的解決標準及實施有關吸收損失能力要求的規則，以提升獲授權機構的可解決性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於一個高度具備韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式影響系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，甚至可能以失序的方式倒閉。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在確保銀行能抵禦衝擊、並能在危機中恢復其地位，從而防止銀行倒閉方面發揮關鍵作用。貨幣管理局負責銀行的審慎監管，並被賦予在香港授權銀行、受限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司（這些機構合稱為授權機構，簡稱AIs）的授權責任。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保，亦即香港的審慎監管框架亦非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣管理局作為一個解決機構，旨在確保在認可機構變得不可持續時，其倒閉可以有序的方式處理。為此，香港已設立一個金融機構解決機制，其中貨幣管理局為認可機構及其他類型機構的解決機構。為落實香港的解決機制，制定解決規則及政策標準、進行解決計劃以消除對認可機構可解決性的障礙，以及提升貨幣管理局處理失敗認可機構的運作能力，至關重要。為有效執行這些工作，貨幣管理局採納國際上協調一致的處理方式。\n\n金管局亦負責某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監督。在監督FMIs時，金管局的目標是推動其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。使FMIs更能應對金融危機，可保護香港的貨幣及金融系統免受因FMIs中斷而產生的可能破壞性效應。有關金管局監督方法的資訊，可於金管局網站上獲得。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 授權\n\n2021年底，香港有：\n\n本年，香港金融管理局向三家非本地銀行授予兩項銀行牌照及一項有限制銀行牌照。香港金融管理局亦向一間外資交易平臺營運商批核了貨幣經紀牌照。本年，三間持牌銀行及兩間有限制牌照銀行的授權被撤銷。\n\n有關人工智能及在香港的本地代表辦事處的更多資料，請參見附錄及頁碼 321 至 324，以及 330 至 333 的表 D 至 F，分別載於此。\n\n# 監督活動簡介\n\n香港金融管理局進行了189項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括資本充足率評級評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技（金融科技）策略。為持續推動更強的風險治理，香港金融管理局與各發起機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層委員會舉行了40場會議。此外，香港金融管理局、發起機構及其外部核數師之間亦舉行了38場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動，香港金融管理局進行定期現場檢查，並配合針對高風險範疇的主題審查。在該年度內，共進行了679次現場檢查及主題審查，重點為信貸風險管理。隨著銀行對科技的採用日益增加，操作風險及科技風險的管理亦成為另一主要關注範疇。香港金融管理局亦增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場檢查及主題審查次數。此外，專門團隊亦進行了針對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性退休金計劃（MPF）相關業務，以及反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施的現場檢查及主題審查。表1載有香港金融管理局2021年監管活動的概要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信用成長與資產品質\n\n總貸款在2021年上升了3.8%，相比2020年的增長1.2%。表2顯示貸款及推進的增長分類。\n\n大陸相關貸款在2021年上升3.6%至47,250億港元（表3）。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在本年大致維持穩定，並根據歷史及國際標準維持在健康水平。截至2021年底，行業的貸款分類比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年起的長期歷史平均值1.8%。與內地相關的貸款比率亦較去年同期下降至0.86%，從前年的0.96%。\n\n全年來，新型冠狀病毒疫情持續對經濟的一些領域造成壓力，同時內地房地產業的信貸事件引起市場關注。香港金融管理局加強了監測範圍及深度，並繼續重點放在銀行對高度槓桿借款人之 exposures 的深入審查。與銀行保持密切聯繫，以促進對經濟及市場發展影響的最新評估，以及銀行風險管理措施是否足夠。整體而言，銀行業面臨的信貸風險被評估為可控。香港金融管理局最新進行的資本壓力測試結果確認，銀行業繼續維持足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端壓力。\n\n專項且主題性的審查於本年進行，以評估人工智能系統對貸款分類及貸款減損提列、海外貸款業務及對私人銀行及資產管理客戶的擔保貸款之控制措施。\n\n# 紓緩客戶所面臨的資金周轉壓力\n\n9月，香港金融管理局及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制公布將預批准本金寬限期計劃延長六個月，至2022年4月底為止。此計劃於2020年5月首度推出，用以延後符合資格的企業客戶的貸款本金償還期限六個月。鑑於本地新型冠狀病毒感染情況出現反彈，該計劃於2022年2月進一步延長至2022年10月底。此外，該計劃亦加強，為那些財務能力足夠且願意逐步恢復本金償還的客戶提供一年期的部分本金償還選項。\n\n截至2021年底，銀行已批准超過83,000個案的貸款期限延長及其他形式的緩解措施，總金額逾港元920十億。針對個人客戶，銀行已批准逾52,000個案的住宅按揭及其他個人纾困貸款的本金寬限期，總金額逾港元53十億。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局推行的一系列逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已加強銀行的風險管理能力及本地樓市突然下跌時銀行業的抗風險能力。2021年12月批准的新住宅按揭貸款（RMLs）的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）為53%，較2009年9月首次推出逆周期措施前的64%為低。2021年12月新按揭貸款的平均還款比率（DSR）仍維持在低水平的36%，較2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%為低（圖1）。\n\n# 運營及科技風險\n\n鑑於銀行日益增加對科技的依賴以支持其運作，香港金融管理局加強了對運作及科技風險的監管。本年度監管重點包括對雲端外包及遠距工作安排的控制。香港金融管理局於12月推出有關「運作韌性」的草案新監管政策手冊（SPM）模組的行業諮詢。新SPM模組旨在為銀行提供指引，協助其建立全面且綜合的運作韌性架構。\n\n香港金融管理局於1月推出「網絡韌性評估框架2.0」，以反映最新有關網絡安全風險管理的良好實踐。

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms)

國際金融中心\n\n2021年，香港金融管理局透過多管齊下方式，達致加強香港作為具競爭力國際金融中心地位的良好進展。\n\n香港金融管理局推出「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融業廣泛採用金融科技，並鞏固香港作為金融科技中心的地位。在更快支付系統方面，其交易額在疫情期間急升。\n\n在增強聯繫方面，本年在連接計劃組合中加入了跨境財富管理通達及債券通南向交易，取得顯著進展。受惠於其世界級的市場基礎設施及連接計劃，香港成為內地資金挖掘全球市場及國際投資者接觸快速發展的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n亦於2021年，香港金融管理局致力於締造新業務機遇，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，範疇包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心以及綠色及可持續金融。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強與海外及內地持份者接觸，讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所帶來的機遇。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局積極參與國際及地區性中央銀行與監管論壇，並為維持全球金融穩定及推動金融市場發展作出貢獻。\n\n# 簡介\n\n香港金融管理局公布其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列推動廣泛採用金融科技（金融科技）的措施，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門一同在本年推動各種重點措施，包括以下內容：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）的採用  \n推行科技基準評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的地位仍然堅決，全年離岸人民幣業務錄得良好增長。隨著主要金融市場指數納入內地證券，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港在協助國際投資者增加對人民幣資產的配置方面發揮不可或缺的作用，內地與香港通（北向通）計劃被廣泛接受為國際投資者進軍內地資本市場的首選渠道。2021年，北向債券通每日成交額上升34%，達約人民幣258十億。\n\n繼北向債券通成功之後，南向債券通於9月推出，完善了內地與國際債券市場的兩向連接。同年同月，中国人民銀行（PBoC）、香港金融管理局（HKMA）及澳門金融管理局公布在廣東–香港–澳門大灣區（GBA）實施「跨境財富管理通」（Cross-boundary WMC）計劃的細則。10月，香港符合資格的銀行開始與其內地合作銀行一同提供跨境財富管理通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為離岸人民幣中心的角色，由香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易所及清算所有限公司（香港交易所）組成的工作小組已成立，以進行可行性研究，推動在香港交易以人民幣計價的股本證券。此外，人民銀行與香港金融管理局於12月合辦了一場聯合研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領導人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推動香港金融平台競爭力的提升。特別是為增加香港作為優選基金 domicile 的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業緊密合作，提供更有助於基金設立的稅務及監管環境。同時，香港金融管理局亦在提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心以及債券發行中心的地位方面取得顯著進展。此外，香港金融管理局亦加強市場推廣，推動香港金融服務向海外及內地持份者推廣。\n\n金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作，是強化香港作為領導國際金融中心地位的基礎。2021年，四間銀行間實時 gross 設計 (RTGS) 系統、中央貨幣市場單位 (CMU) 及香港交易場地達致 100% 系統可用性，超越了 99.95% 的目標。在9月推出南向債券通後，CMU 成為在北向通及南向債券通下進行交易的結算及保管服務提供者。\n\nFPS 的使用持續擴大。2021 年底登記數目增至 960 萬，全年平均每日交易額較 2020 年上升 9 成。增加使用 FPS 來處理政府帳單、進行商戶付款及增值儲值卡 (SVF) 電子錢包或銀行帳戶，是推動交易量持續上升的主因，加上個人對個人及商業付款的穩定增長。\n\n為推動本地零售支付行業的安全及效率，香港金融管理局負責監察六個指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監督十五間獲牌的儲值支付工具（SVFs）。 本年內，香港金融管理局透過協調及推動相關政府部門與為該計劃所委任的儲值支付工具發牌機構之間的對話與合作，促進政府消費券計劃的暢順落實。\n\n2022年1月，香港金融管理局發佈了一篇有關加密資產及穩定幣的討論文件，說明香港金融管理局對相關監管方法的思考，並邀請持份者提供觀看量。在制定合適的監管制度時，會考慮相關因素，包括對本討論文件的回饋及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中擔任領導角色。例如，香港金融管理局擔任東亞太平洋中央銀行高級管理層會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）的主席。香港金融管理局亦與他人共同擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）政策與標準小組、非銀行監測專家小組及金融穩定理事會（FSB）金融創新網絡的主席，並領導一個專門研究與金融基准轉換相關監管問題的團隊。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 金融科技 2025\n\n六月，香港金融管理局公布其「金融科技2025」策略，以帶動香港金融科技的發展。該策略目標是鼓勵金融業於2025年前全面應用科技，同時推動提供公平且高效能的金融服務，以造福香港市民及經濟。該策略的五大範疇為：\n\n- 所有銀行進行金融科技\n- 深化研究香港以因應央行數位貨幣\n- 締造下一代數據基礎建設\n- 擴展具金融科技素養的 workforce\n- 以資金與政策培育生態系統\n\n香港金融管理局的「金融科技2025」策略推動香港的金融科技發展\n\n# 銀行業的金融科技採用\n\n為支持「金融科技2025」策略中的「所有銀行進行金融科技」倡議，香港金融管理局於2021年6月推出了科技基準評估。該評估的目標是協助香港金融管理局更好地了解銀行業當前的金融科技發展情況，並識別哪些金融科技範疇可能需要香港金融管理局的支援。所有在香港有重大業務運作的持牌銀行，被要求於2021年底前制定一個三年期的金融科技採用計劃。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局亦繼續實施其兩年期路線圖，以推動香港銀行採用合規科技，並在其自身的監管過程中融入科技，以優化效率及成效。詳情請見「銀行穩定」章節第98頁。\n\n# 批發中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局與泰國銀行於2021年2月加入阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所後，擴大了他們的聯合研究項目範疇。此項目重命名為「多國央行數字貨幣橋樑（mBridge）」，並受到香港國際貨幣基金組織創新中心的大力支援。項目進一步探討分散式分類帳技術的能力，以促進在多管轄環境下，以即時方式進行24小時全天候的跨境外匯付款對付款（PvP）交易。一份聯合報告於9月發出，以呈現中期結果，隨後於11月發出潛力應用個案及未來發展路線圖。\n\n# 零售央行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在零售CBDC發行方面的準備工作具備未來適應性，香港金融管理局（HKMA）開始研究在香港發行零售CBDC的前景，即電子港元（e-HKD），涵蓋技術及政策方面的考慮。 HKMA與香港銀行協調創新中心合作，啟動了一項名為「Project Aurum」的研究，以探討發行零售CBDC的技術方面。 此外，HKMA設立了一個跨部門的工作小組，專門研究相關的技術、政策及法律問題。 10月，HKMA發布了一篇技術白皮書，題為《e-HKD：技術觀點》，以探討並邀請意見，就發行及分銷零售CBDC的潛在技術設計選項。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局支持人民銀行數字貨幣研究所進行以數字人民幣進行跨境支付的技術試點。這將協助推動廣東灣區的互聯互通，並透過增強跨境支付的效率及用戶經驗，為香港與內地旅客帶來更大便利。\n\n# 商業資料交換\n\n7月，香港金融管理局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行及穩定幣發行機構參與央行數字貨幣（CDI），這是一項下一代金融數據基礎設施，其目標是促進銀行系統內更高效的金融中介。為進一步促進發展與採用，香港金融管理局於研討會期間公布將推出CDI創新中心。為促進中小企業（SME）融資，香港金融管理局已完成兩階段的概念驗證研究，以檢視CDI的技術可行性。透過應用替代數據以促進信貸評估及貸款發放，參與銀行在研究期間已批准總額超過9億港元、逾550筆的中小企業貸款。基於鼓舞人心的結果，香港金融管理局於11月宣布啟動CDI的試點。\n\n中小企業主讚揚CDI簡化其貸款申請\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange

資產管理\n\n全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑。儘管全球經濟繼續受影響於不斷演變的新型冠狀病毒疫情情況，但一些因素，包括疫苗接種率增加以及世界各地寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施，已為全球經濟及金融市場帶來不俗的復甦。在這個背景下，多個海外股市在該年度錄得歷史新高，而交易所基金的整體股票投資亦能在香港股市表現呆滯的情況下，取得不俗的回報。2021年，交易所基金錄得投資收入達港元1,919十億，投資回報率為4.1%。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n香港發鈔銀行的首要目標，如《發鈔銀行條例》所訂，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。發鈔銀行亦可能用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局根據財政司司長轉授的權限，並在轉授權限的範圍內，就發鈔銀行的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 財政儲備基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）已為證券交易所基金建立以下投資目標：\n\n（i）保障資本；  \n（ii）確保在任何時候，整體貨幣基礎均十足受支持於高度流通性的美元資產；  \n（iii）確保為維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的，有足夠流動性可獲得；及  \n（iv）受制於（i）至（iii），爭取投資回報，以協助維持發行基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標已全面考慮發行基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合（圖示1）。\n\n圖示 1 交易所基金資產分離\n\n大致來說，發行基金有兩大資產組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流通性的美元資產，以提供全面支持予貨幣基礎，並符合貨幣委員會安排所要求的所需支持。IP則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券及股權市場，以保障資產價值及長遠購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以謹慎及逐步的方式，將貨幣發行局（Exchange Fund）投資組合中的一部分，分散投資至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券及股票、私人股權（包括基礎設施）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券及股票由貨幣發行保證基金（IP）持有，而私人股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。香港金融管理局自LTGP設立以來，已訂下一個上限（cap1）以指引分散投資至LTGP的進程。隨著LTGP在投資規模及資產多樣性方面日益成熟，貨幣發行局財務委員會（EFAC）於2022年1月決定以一個與其他資產類別同時確定的目標資產配置，取代該上限，並受制於謹慎風險管理的原則。\n\n於2007年設立的戰略投資組合，持有香港交易所及清算有限公司的股份，這些股份是由政府為交易所基金帳戶的戰略目的而購入。由於其獨特的性質，戰略投資組合不包括在基金投資表現的評估範疇內。\n\n# 存款與發行基金\n\n發行局有時會接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP2的表現掛鉤，但未來基金3是個別例子，其利率根據投資組合比例與IP及LTGP的回報掛鉤。2021年，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40：60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券交易所基金的投資過程是以兩種資產配置類型的決定為基礎：戰略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資指標中，代表證券交易所基金投資目標下的長期資產配置。在戰略性配置的指引下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以爭取超越指標的報酬。這意味著實際配置往往與指標（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與指標配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然指標及追蹤誤差4上限是由財政司在與證券交易所基金委員會諮詢後制定，但戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局在授權下作出。在戰術性偏離容許範圍內，投資組合經理可能根據短期市場變動而採取投資立場（圖示2）。\n\n圖示 2 交易所基金資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的發行基金投資辦事處設有其投資及相關風險管理功能。發行基金投資辦事處的職員直接管理約71%的發行基金投資，包括全部的BP及其中一章的IP。這部分的IP包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及各種衍生產品對沖組合，用以實施為基金進行宏觀風險管理的策略。\n\n# 使用外部管理人員\n\n除內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦僱用外部基金管理機構管理約29%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他特別資產類別。聘請外部管理機構的目的是挖掘市場上可獲得的最佳投資專業知識，以獲取可持續回報，汲取多樣化且互補的投資方式，並取得投資方面的市場見解及技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部經理有關的支出包括基金經理費及保管費、交易費用，以及扣繳及其他稅費。此支出主要由市場因素所決定，且可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的複雜性日益增加，突顯了風險管理的重要性。香港金融管理局為內部及外部管理的投資組合設立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並確保有嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。為有效實施風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已設立三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸風險、市場風險、流動性風險及操作風險）會定期監察，而風險管理程序則提供良好框架，以支持戰略規劃及投資多元化。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局相信，透過適當地重視負責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，可更有效地爭取交易所基金的投資目標，並減低其基礎投資在環境、社會及治理（ESG）相關事宜所涉及的風險。香港金融管理局支持負責任投資，透過將ESG因素併入交易所基金在公眾及私人市場投資的投資過程，其指導原則為：若長期風險調整後回報與其他投資相若，則一般會優先考慮ESG投資。如欲了解更多有關香港金融管理局負責任投資架構及實施情況的資料，請見第184至191頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2021年金融市場\n\n全球股市在超寬鬆貨幣政策及財政措施的推動下急升並創下新高，推動全球經濟與金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港及內地股市在市場改革的背景下表現遜色。美國標準普爾500指數上漲27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌14%。\n\n對債券市場而言，2021年上升的通貨膨脹預期以及美國聯邦儲備系統（Fed）縮減資產購入，導致美國國債收益率上升、債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率從年初的0.9%上升至年底的1.5%，上漲約60個基點。\n\n在貨幣市場上，美元對其他主要貨幣轉強，尤其在2021年底，因市場預期聯邦儲備委員會縮減步伐。特別是，歐元和日圓對美元貶值分別為7.1%和10.3%。\n\n2021年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n香港發行機構在2021年錄得投資收入達港元1,919十億。此收入包括債券收益港元126十億，股票淨收益港元478十億（其中來自外資股票的收益為港元688十億，來自香港股票的虧損為港元210十億），非港元資產的正貨幣兌換效應港元168十億，以及基金投資持倉子公司所持其他投資的收益港元1,147十億。此外，戰略投資組合錄得評值收益港元31十億。\n\n交易所基金的總資產於年底達到4,570.2十億港元。在長期資產管理計劃下的投資總值為515.3十億港元，其中私人股權為392.5十億港元，不動產為122.8十億港元。長期資產管理計劃的未償投資承諾總值為225.7十億港元。\n\n2021年交易所基金的投資回報（不包括戰略投資組合）為4.1%。具體而言，IP的回報率為3.7%，而BP則錄得0.4%。LTGP自2009年成立以來，已錄得年化內部報酬率15.4%。\n\n自1994年至2021年，交易所基金的年度回報詳見圖1。表2顯示2021年的投資回報及基金在若干不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。2019至2021年的平均回報為5.3%，2017至2021年為4.7%，2012至2021年為3.3%，自1994年以來則為4.8%。表3顯示2021年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組成。\n\n見到第211至319頁以取得交易所基金經審計的2021年財務報表。\n"}

A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"developing":["發展"],"function":["職能"],"particular":["特別"],"9.6":["960"],"strong":["強"],"27":["27"],"highly":["高度"],"students":["學生"],"seize":["把握"],"use":["使用"],"co-ordinates":["統籌"],"safeguard":["保障"],"second":["第二"],"launch":["推出"],"’":[""],"maintain":["維持"],"relate":["有關"],"dedicated":["致力於"],"face":["面對"],"talk":["介紹"],"enhance":["提升"],"lingering":["持續的"],"recommendations":["建議"],"built":["建立"],"42":["42"],"maintaining":["維持"],"areas":["範疇"],"flexible":["靈活"],"serving":["服務"],"comprises":["包括"],"grow":["增長"],"began":["開始"],"sharp":["顯著"],"turn":["轉變"],"allowing":["讓"],"2017":["2017"],"participating":["參與"],"well":["良好"],"strengthening":["加強"],"aspects":["方面"],"outbreak":["爆發"],"adhere":["恪守"],"knowledge":["知識"],"based":["以⋯⋯為基礎"],"billion":["十億"],"track":["軌道"],"end":["年底"],"rougher":["崎嶇"],"get":["變得"],"lent":["提供"],"substantial":["大量"],"payment-related":["用作支付用途的"],"Looking":["展望"],"191.9":["1,919"],"December":["12月"],"mean":["意思是"],"mobilising":["引導"],"base":["基礎"],"brought":["帶來"],"need":["需要"],"Subsequently":["其後"],"Finally":["最後"],"seeking":["尋求"],"rollout":["推出"],"governments":["政府"],"mainly":["主要"],"double-digit":["雙位數"],"reduction":["減少"],"continue":["繼續"],"cement":["鞏固"],"entered":["踏入"],"demonstrated":["顯示"],"volatile":["波動"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"providing":["提供"],"benefitting":["受惠"],"also":["亦"],"capture":["把握"],"premature":["過早"],"adding":["加上"],"tough":["艱難"],"committed":["致力"],"faring":["表現"],"aspires":["旨在"],"status":["地位"],"managing":["管理"],"parts":["部分"],"better":["更好"],"first":["首個"],"recovery":["復甦"],"equivalent":["等值"],"namely":["即"],"deteriorated":["惡化"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"4.1":["4.1"],"invite":["邀請"],"Despite":["儘管"],"severe":["嚴重"],"discussion":["討論"],"must":["必須"],"relevant":["相關"],"Meanwhile":["另一方面"],"successful":["成功"],"goes":["有云"],"marks":["標誌"],"increased":["上升"],"see":["見到"],"2050":["2050"],"solid":["穩健"],"past":["過去"],"together":["一同"],"real-time":["即時"],"formulated":["制定"],"pleased":["高興"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"Although":["儘管"],"90":["九成"],"effectively":["有效"],"maintained":["維持"],"ready":["準備就緒"],"vibrancy":["活力"],"years":["年"],"contraction":["收縮"],"point":["指出"],"may":["可能"],"changed":["改變"],"intensification":["升溫"],"prudently":["審慎"],"RMB26":["260億元人民幣"],"traded":["成交"],"increase":["上升"],"tap":["挖掘"],"two":["兩"],"year":["年"],"introduced":["推出"],"recover":["恢復"],"aligning":["呼應"],"groom":["培育"],"151.9":["151.9"],"journey":["旅程"],"future":["未來"],"adopting":["採納"],"set":["建立"],"continued":["繼續"],"increasingly":["日益"],"practical":["實用"],"go":["進行"],"pace":["步伐"],"launched":["推出"],"activity":["活動"],"emergence":["出現"],"extended":["延長"],"published":["發出"],"months":["個月"],"dominant":["主導"],"meeting":["滿足"],"established":["設立"],"throughout":["全"],"enhancing":["增強"],"Tackling":["處理"],"tCO2e\/US":["tCO2e"],"formulate":["制定"],"watch":["留意"],"series":["連串"],"strengthen":["加強"],"achieved":["達致"],"grew":["增長"],"promote":["推動"],"always":["一如既往"],"establishment":["設立"],"hard-pressed":["經營環境艱難"],"pressure":["壓力"],"five":["五"],"require":["需要"],"manage":["管理"],"87":["87%"],"enter":["進入"],"recorded":["錄得"],"revised":["修訂"],"power":["力量"],"cover":["涵蓋"],"trials":["測試"],"facilitate":["促進"],"closely":["緊密"],"concurrent":["同時"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"share":["分享"],"time":["時"],"tackle":["應對"],"guidance":["指引"],"degree":["程度"],"colleagues":["同事"],"reaching":["達到"],"quote":["舉例"],"diversifying":["多元化"],"50":["50"],"across":["橫跨"],"number":["數目"],"15.4":["15.4"],"covering":["涵蓋"],"cash-flow":["資金周轉"],"path":["路徑"],"resources":["資源"],"invest":["投資"],"organisation":["機構"],"outside":["境外"],"leveraging":["利用"],"twice":["兩度"],"six":["6"],"Besides":["此外"],"million":["百萬"],"numerous":["無數"],"completing":["完善"],"timely":["及時"],"capitalise":["把握"],"reaffirming":["重申"],"supporting":["支持"],"taking":["採取"],"feedback":["回饋"],"latter":["後者"],"ever":["曾"],"appropriate":["合適"],"fourfold":["四倍"],"facing":["面對"],"ultimately":["最終"],"comprehensively":["全面"],"kinds":["類"],"us":["我們"],"overnight":["一朝一夕"],"reflecting":["反映"],"reached":["達到"],"principle":["原則"],"testament":["見證"],"essentially":["本質上"],"including":["包括"],"developmental":["發展的"],"develop":["制訂"],"joined":["攜手"],"achievements":["成果"],"room":["空間"],"levels":["層面"],"help":["協助"],"vision":["願景"],"robustness":["穩健"],"recognising":["鑑於"],"quarter":["季度"],"proactive":["主動"],"city":["城市"],"helping":["幫助"],"assured":["保障"],"cycle":["循環"],"1983":["1983"],"128":["128"],"arising":["產生"],"adopt":["應用"],"huge":["巨大"],"milestone":["里程碑"],"worse":["惡化"],"prospect":["前景"],"spectrum":["範疇"],"disclose":["披露"],"grown":["發展"],"resurgence":["反彈"],"purchasing":["購買力"],"virtuous":["生生不息"],"footing":["基礎"],"start":["開始"],"still":["仍"],"connect":["聯繫"],"offers":["提供"],"ensure":["確保"],"fact":["事實"],"conviction":["信心"],"forefront":["領先"],"leveraged":["借助"],"attract":["吸引"],"jurisdiction":["地區"],"Enhancing":["提升"],"position":["地位"],"rise":["上升"],"totalling":["總額達"],"underpinned":["支撐"],"crucial":["至關重要"],"jointly":["聯同"],"generated

企業網站\n\n公司網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）以英文及傳統及簡體中文載有超過44,000頁內容，並為公眾提供有關香港金融管理局（HKMA）最新資訊的入口。網站載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs證券從業員登記冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》維持的儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局自2018年起透過開放應用程式介面（API）分階段於其網站上發布財務數據及重要資訊。至2021年底，香港金融管理局已於其網站上開放148組開放API，符合專項計劃的安排。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心設於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向公眾介紹香港金融管理局工作的重要設施，並推動社會對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。該中心分為展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式簡介香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況。該區亦載有有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資料及展品，供公眾研究之用。圖書館設於展覽區旁，收藏超過26,000冊有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行主題的書籍、期刊及其他刊物。圖書館亦保持根據《銀行條例》第20條所規定的機構代表辦事處登記冊及機構證券人員登記冊，以供公眾查閱。\n\n為保障公眾健康及安全，於新型冠狀病毒肺炎疫情期間，資訊中心訂下了特殊運作安排。清潔及消毒工作加強，並定期以抗菌塗層對設施及展品進行清潔消毒。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的展覽區包括政策部分、貨幣部分及歷史時間軸\n\n# 社區參與與公眾教育\n\n為接觸社區並提升公眾對香港金融管理局工作的認識，該局自1998年起一直舉辦公共教育計劃。2021年，為來自84間中學的逾2,300名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。該研討會涵蓋香港金融管理局的工作簡介、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數碼鑰匙的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的就業機會。截至現時，已有超過63,000人參與該公共教育計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局透過教育及聯繫公眾，讓他們了解如何成為精明及負責任的金融消費者。鑑於詐騙手法增加，香港金融管理局進行了一項主題為「保障個人數位鑰匙；謹慎防範詐騙連結！」的公眾意識提升活動，並透過多媒體推廣，呼籲公眾行使暫停終止權，提高警覺，以防範偽裝成銀行發出的短訊及電郵中所附的詐欺超連結。\n\n跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾謹慎防範詐欺超連結\n\n金管局亦旨在提升公眾對金融業的認識，並提升年輕一代投身業內事業的興趣。繼2020年網上劇集《STEPS》獲得正面回饋後，金管局推出一連串新系列《中央地區人才四面體》，內容橫跨金融業四個日益發展的範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及資產管理。在該系列短片中，市場從業人員的人物形象以幽默方式描繪，經驗豐富的業內人士與年輕人才亦分享有關上述四個範疇內工作性質及要求、事業機遇與前景的親身資訊。\n\n「中央四類人才」系列保持年輕一代對金融市場就業機會的掌握\n\n2020年推出的「線上親子教育活動」在2021年MarketingInteractive的「最佳活動——企業社會責任」類別中獲得了銀獎。基於該活動的成功並為持續動力，香港金融管理局推出了增加的措施，包括親子財務教育工作坊，其中兒童教育專家分享了如何教孩子良好財務意義的技巧，並展示了DIY（自製）財務教育玩具，以及一個動畫虛擬導覽香港金融管理局資訊中心的活動。\n\n「線上親子教育活動」在2021年行銷活動大獎中獲得了獎項。該活動推動金錢管理的理念與技巧，讓父母與孩子以輕鬆有趣的方式學習。\n\n為提升中學學生的金融理財知識，香港金融管理局與各種持份者合辦「香港金融理財知識錦標賽」，主題為金融科技。除了網上問答環節外，更加入一個新的個人財務管理金融設計思維工作坊，以培訓參與學生製訂創新理財工具的方案。此項計劃獲教育局「商校合作計劃」頒發「最高學生參與獎」，並獲投資者及財務教育委員會（IFEC）頒發「投資者及財務教育獎（機構組）— 銀獎」。\n\n「香港金融理財知識錦標賽」透過教授學生金融科技及設計思維概念，實現參與人數創新高\n\n其他社區參與活動包括為學生及退休人士舉辦的講座或網上研討會。香港金融管理局亦參與了教育局舉辦的有關經濟安全的教師培訓網上研討會。提供有關自動櫃員機（ATM）使用技巧的智能提示的網上教育資料，以八種語言提供，以照顧在香港居留的不同背景人士的需要。\n\n香港金融管理局支持IFEC推動香港的金融理財知識及能力，並會探討與持份者進一步合作，以最大化社區參與的影響。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高水平的透明度，香港金融管理局根據適用於中央銀行運作的國際標準，採納財務披露的國際標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特殊數據發布標準。財政部門與外部會計師及其他專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告準則編製及呈報發行基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦在其年度報告中提供詳細的披露及對廣泛費用項目及預算資料的深入分析。\n\n# 問責性與控制措施\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）最重要的工作之一是管理貨幣及銀行體系的風險。風險管理既在日常運作的執行層面進行，亦在較高層次透過戰略規劃進行。根據香港金融管理局的風險管理架構，設有兩個高層次委員會——宏觀監測委員會及風險委員會，兩者皆由香港金融管理局總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監測委員會的職責範圍為：\n\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融體系所面臨的潛在風險及威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可行措施；\n- 檢討現有管理貨幣及金融體系風險的措施，以識別可能的缺口，並確保這些措施的充足性；及\n- 鼓勵跨部門分享有關宏觀監測的相關資訊，鑑於增強香港金融管理局的宏觀監測能力。\n\n風險委員會的職責範圍為：\n\n- 識別機構可能面臨的風險與威脅，並制定策略以減低相關活動的影響；\n- 檢討現有風險管理系統，橫跨不同部門識別可能的缺口與重大風險，並確保應對措施充足；\n- 協調風險衡量的標準與方法，並優先管理已識別的風險資源；\n- 培養機構內更強的風險管理文化，推動嚴謹的授權與控制層面。\n\n已建立良好之運營風險管理架構，涵蓋機構在兩層面之風險：機構層面及部門層面。機構層面風險主要指中長期影響整個機構，或可能需要跨部門因應之風險。各業務單位識別出之潛在及新興風險，以及其制定之控制措施與緩解策略是否充足，每季度會進行審查並報告。此架構並配合由上而下之方式管理機構層面風險，由不同業務單位之高層同事積極識別影響較廣之風險，並提出緩解措施。風險委員會討論這些評估，並決定適當之跟進行動。\n"}
{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot

可持續性\n\n香港金融管理局正發佈其首個可持續發展報告，作為其2021年年度報告其中一章，以說明其可持續發展策略，並記錄其自身努力及其與金融業合作支持政府氣候策略的行動，並貢獻於建立一個更具氣候韌性及可持續的未來。\n\n香港金融管理局將可持續性考慮融入其主要角色和功能之中，無論其作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，或在維持金融及貨幣穩定方面。此外，香港金融管理局亦與本地及海外機構合作，加強氣候風險的管理及披露，以及推動綠色及可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，目標是成為一個負責任且可持續發展的機構。此承諾體現在各種範疇，包括推動一個可持續、金融普及且環境友好的市場，支持廣大社區，保護環境，並營造一個關愛的工作空間。\n\n# 簡介\n\n氣候變遷是當前世界面臨的最大挑戰之一。為應對氣候變遷，各國在《巴黎協議》下同意推行行動以減少溫室氣體（GHG）排放，並最終爭取在本世紀內實現碳中和。達成《巴黎協議》的氣候變遷目標，將需要全球每年估計投資1至2萬億美元，這使得可持續性成為未來數十年資本流動的最大推動力。\n\n香港已制定成為此轉變領先者的方針。政府公布將爭取於2050年前實現碳中和，與全球其他發達經濟體保持一致。香港亦為首個承諾於2025年前橫跨相關行業，具體呼應氣候相關財務披露任務組（TCFD）建議的亞洲地區。\n\n對金融業而言，氣候變遷既是風險來源，也是機會。雖然金融業無法避免氣候變遷所帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演關鍵角色，透過將更多資金導向與降低溫室氣體排放路徑相符，且具氣候韌性的活動。\n\n香港金融管理局致力於加強香港的金融體系，以支持更綠色及可持續的未來，推動行動支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議題作出貢獻。為達成此目標，香港金融管理局在履行其主要職能及日常運作中 incorporates 可持續性考慮。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局的目標是加強銀行系統對氣候風險的抗風險能力，並加快銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的力度。為達成此目標，香港金融管理局已制定一套監管框架，說明銀行在管理及披露氣候風險方面的監管要求。此外，於2021年亦順利完成有關氣候風險壓力測試的試驗，以評估銀行業的抗風險能力。另一方面，香港金融管理局亦持續將氣候變遷納入監測金融穩定風險的考慮範疇內。\n\n第二，就其市場發展角色而言，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正聚焦於增強香港作為區域內綠色及可持續金融中心的角色，包括廣東粵港澳大灣區（GBA）。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，具備良好條件，可將全球投資引導至內地實現2030年達峰及2060年碳中和的目標。香港金融管理局亦透過其綠色及可持續金融跨部門督导小組（CASG）3，該小組由香港金融管理局聯席主辦，以加強行業能力建設、應對數據缺口，並探討本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融解決方案方面處於領先地位，已於政府綠色債券計劃下設立全球首個政府發行的中長期票據計劃，專門用於綠色債券發行，並自2019年起逐步擴大發行種類，包括貨幣種類及期限。為支持私人部門發行綠色及可持續債券及貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色及可持續金融補貼計劃。此計劃由香港金融管理局管理，已鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，並促使更多綠色顧問及外部評審機構建立或擴大其在香港的業務。\n\n第三，作為發鈔銀行，香港金融管理局確保環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素已成為其投資過程及資產配置決策的其中一章。在本報告的後者部分，香港金融管理局作出其首份有關發鈔基金組合的氣候情景分析及碳足跡指標的披露。\n\n第四，香港金融管理局正積極推動自身的綠色辦公室計劃，以確保其運作符合管理及緩解氣候風險的最佳實踐。作為開始，香港金融管理局已橫跨範疇1及範疇2排放建立了自身的碳足跡，並作出相關披露。同時，香港金融管理局已實施措施以提升行業整體運作效率及減少資源消耗。此外，香港金融管理局亦以高標準履行企業社會責任（CSR），並與持份者合作，推動金融包容性及金融理財知識。\n\n綠化金融系統需要中央銀行與監管機構之間的緊密合作。香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦是國際社會在全球政策制定及可持續性標準協調方面積極的成員。HKMA 亦發出聲明支持「綠化金融系統中央銀行與監管機構網絡」（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言5，重申其落實NGFS建議的承諾，並採取必要措施促進更綠色的金融系統。\n\n推動這些可持續發展倡議，並評估氣候相關的機會與風險時，可持續發展及環保考慮已融入香港金融管理局（HKMA）的治理及風險管理架構中，領導層積極參與設定整體目標及指導原則，並與發行基金顧問委員會（EFAC）及其下屬委員會進行諮詢。香港金融管理局的機構社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦評估可持續發展及氣候相關問題對機構的潛在影響，並制定策略以減低這些影響。相關策略及倡議的執行情況會緊密監察，並定期向高層管理層報告。此外，亦已聘請外部顧問在特定範疇為HKMA提供意見。\n\n本章後續各節將探討香港金融管理局在各角色中進行綠色金融及可持續發展工作的治理架構、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參考了NGFS於2021年12月發出的《中央銀行氣候相關披露指引》所建議的披露要素。此外，與香港金融管理局辦事處運作相關的資訊，廣泛參考了全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準下的報告原則，以及香港交易所發出的環境、社會及治理（ESG）報告指引。\n\n# 中央銀行與監管機構網絡：綠色金融體系建設\n\nNGFS 提供一個平台，讓中央銀行及審慎監管當局交換經驗、分享最佳實踐，貢獻於金融部門環境與氣候風險管理的發展，並動員主流金融資源支持轉型至可持續經濟。其目的是界定並推動最佳實踐，於 NGFS 成員內外實施，並進行或委託有關綠色金融的分析工作。\n\n# 氣候相關財務披露任務小組\n\n2015年12月，金融穩定委員會成立氣候變遷財務風險委員會（TCFD），以制訂建議，協助企業就氣候相關資訊作出更有效的披露，以協助投資者、貸款人及保險承保人作出更明智的決策。TCFD的建議以四個主題範疇為基礎，這些範疇代表了組織營運的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理以及指標與目標。\n\n# 銀行業監督官\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應主動管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資金導向綠色及可持續活動。作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局專注於提升銀行對氣候風險的抗風險能力，並加快銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的行動。\n\n# 簡介香港金融管理局三階段的策略\n\n自2019年5月以來，香港金融管理局已分三個階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業：\n\n# 階段一\n\n建立一個共同框架以評估各銀行的「綠色基準」，並與國際機構合作，為香港銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 階段 ii\n\n諮詢業界及其他持份者有關綠色及可持續銀行的監管預期及要求。\n\n# 階段 III\n\n聚焦於落實監管要求，監測與評估銀行在綠色及可持續銀行業務方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n2020年，香港金融管理局與業界合作，制定了一套共同框架，用以評估各銀行的「綠色基準」。香港金融管理局亦進行了首個銀行綠色度評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行準備新監管要求，香港金融管理局於2020年6月發出一份白皮書，闡釋其對氣候風險管理監管期望的初步想法。\n\n2021年12月，香港金融管理局根據行業諮詢結果，發佈了銀行將氣候因素納入治理、戰略、風險管理及披露的監管要求。特別地，根據TCFD的建議，在2025年前，強制要求銀行進行與氣候相關的披露，並設定了具體的時間表。這些要求將為銀行提升風險管理能力設立一個標準。\n\n下一步是香港金融管理局監察銀行落實相關要求。在此方面，香港金融管理局已透過在其銀行監管部內設立一個新成立的專責團隊，加強其監管能力，以進行氣候風險監察。\n\n此三階段方法為一反覆且持續演進的過程。繼2020年進行的首輪綠色評估後，香港金融管理局正檢視框架，以涵蓋有關氣候風險管理的新監管要求，並有可能擴展至更廣大的範疇，例如其他環境風險及支持淨零轉型的措施。香港金融管理局預計於2022年下半年推出更新後的框架。\n\n# 支持轉型至碳中和的聲譽實踐\n\n除了將氣候風險考量融入風險管理架構外，一些銀行已致力於投入資源並採取措施，以支持巴黎協議的目標，並貢獻於實現全球淨零排放。香港金融管理局於2021年12月發佈通告，與業界分享這些銀行的良好實踐，這些實踐對其他銀行在制定其氣候策略時具有參考價值。這些良好實踐被歸納為四個範疇：減少銀行自身運作的温室氣體排放、透過投資組合對齊減少所資助的排放、協助客戶轉型，以及推動集體努力協助經濟實現淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融流動\n\n為增加金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的一致制定，香港金融管理局一直與其他金融監管機構合作，探討一套本地的綠色分類框架，以促進在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）8 所制定的共同基礎稅收分類（CGT）與中國及歐盟所採用的綠色定義之間的導航，並在不同金融領域內推行。此項工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性為原則，並考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地因素。此項倡議將減低「綠色洗白」的風險，優化產品可比性，並最終提升投資者保障。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變遷所帶來潛在衝擊的能力，香港金融管理局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試點試驗，包括20間主要零售銀行及國際銀行集團的七間分行參與。一份總結試點CRST試驗結果的報告於2021年12月發出。結果顯示，即使面對極端的氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍然具備強韌性，儘管這些衝擊有可能對銀行的財務狀況造成重大負面影響。CRST試驗有助提升銀行測量及評估氣候風險的能力。鑑於CRST的結果，參與銀行已制定計劃，以加強其氣候策略及風險治理架構。香港金融管理局將繼續與業界保持聯繫，以加強銀行的能力並提升CRST框架，並考慮試點試驗所獲得的經驗教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

交易所基金\n\n審計總監報告交換基金財務報表\n\n# 审计委员会 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 送交財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，載於第217至319頁，包括交易所基金及集團於2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該會計年度的收入支出賬戶、綜合收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要的會計政策概要。\n\n依我意見，財務報表已根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」），真實、公平地反映基金及集團於2021年12月31日的財務地位，以及該等實體於該年度的財務表現及現金流，並已根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒佈的總督指令妥為編製。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我根據財政司司長根據《發行基金條例》第7部分作出的指示及審計委員會的審計準則進行了審計。根據這些準則，我的責任已在我的報告中「財務報表審計的審計師責任部分」進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立於集團，並已根據這些準則履行了我的其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且合適，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 重要審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為那些在我專業判斷中，對我審計2021年12月31日結賬年度財務報表最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在我審計財務報表整體的過程中處理的，並在形成我的意見時考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債的公允價值計量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額達港元4,502,475百萬，金融負債總額達港元1,150,861百萬，按公允價值計價。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 89% 以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值是以活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1 輸入）為基礎，或以基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術來估計（Level 2 輸入）。\n\n對於餘下11%的這些金融資產，其公允價值是以非基於可觀察市場數據（第三層輸入）的計價技術來估計。這些金融資產總值為港元517,316百萬，包括主要為未上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於大量且涉及估計的性質，金融資產及金融負債以公允價值計價為一重大審計事項。\n\n有關金融資產及以公允價值計量的金融負債的評估程序包括：\n\n- 了解用以評估不同類別金融資產及金融負債之價值的程序，包括相關控制措施；\n- 評估及測試電腦系統之相關應用控制措施；\n- 從外部取得有關金融資產及金融負債之價值、存在性、權利與義務及完整性之確認；\n- 若使用 quoted market prices，則驗證價格是否來自獨立資料來源；\n- 若使用以可觀察市場資料為基礎之估值技術，則評估估值方法之適當性及假設之合理性，並驗證輸入資料是否來自獨立資料來源；以及\n- 若使用非以可觀察市場資料為基礎之估值技術，則評估估值方法之適當性及假設與輸入資料之合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產按公允價值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n集團之投資物業按其公允價值列帳，截至2021年12月31日總額達港幣27,089百萬。集團亦持有權益於一間聯營公司及二十一間合營公司，總額達港幣45,172百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業之公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有，或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，均主要以獨立專業估值師之估值為基礎確定。有關估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所採用之估值方法及假設。\n\n針對以公允價值計量的投資性不動產的會計程序包括：\n\n取得及檢視集團直接或透過聯營公司或合營公司所持投資物業的估值報告，並確認公允價值是以估值報告中列帳的估值為基礎；  \n評估估值師的獨立性及資格；以及  \n評估估值方法的適當性及假設與輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金管局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港金融管理局2021年年度報告內的所有資料，除外財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中所獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則看起來存在重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此事實。就此事而言，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 財政部與發行基金顧問委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《發行基金條例》第7條作出的總督指令，編製提供真實公允視點的財務報表，並負責貨幣管理局認為為使財務報表免受重大誤導（無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致）而必要的內部控制。\n\n在準備財務報表時，貨幣當局有責任評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並以持續經營的會計基礎為準。\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會的審計子委員會負責監督集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否在重大錯誤或舞弊的情況下保持免費，取得合理保證，並發出包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總能偵測出存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能來自舞弊或錯誤，如果單獨或總體而言，這些錯誤可能合理地被預期會影響用戶根據這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則這些錯誤就被視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計的過程中，我依循專業判斷並維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別並評估財務報表中重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能發現因詐欺所致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤所致的風險，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但此目的並非就集團內部控制的成效發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣當局所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及其會計估計的合理性及相關披露是否恰當；\n- 對貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能導致集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我必須在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，若這些披露不充分，則必須修改我的意見。我的結論是以取得的審計證據為基礎，截至我審計師報告的日期。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營的實體；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露部分，以及財務報表是否以適當的方式反映基礎交易和活動，以達到公允呈現；\n- 取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊足夠且適當的審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指導、監督及執行。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與發行基金顧問委員會的審計子委員會就審計的預計範圍及時間安排以及重大審計結果進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺失。\n\n我亦向發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會提供聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用情況下，提供相關保障措施。\n\n根據與交易所基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會所進行的聯繫，我釐定在當前期間財務報表審計中最具重大性的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。我在審計師報告中說明這些事項，除非法律或規例禁止披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果會合理地超過披露該事項所帶來的公共利益福利，因此決定不於報告中披露該事項。\n\n朱俊
