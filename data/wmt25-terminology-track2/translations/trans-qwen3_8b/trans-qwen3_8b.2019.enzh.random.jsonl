{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

財政與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年起實施的聯繫匯率制度（LERS），幫助香港抵禦了多次挑戰和衝擊，展現其作為香港經濟繁榮基石及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管本年面對困難的內外環境，聯繫匯率制度仍繼續以暢順有序的方式運作，再一次證明其在不確定性時期的韌性。香港銀行體系亦仍然穩健強大。事實勝於雄辯：香港貨幣匯率仍然穩定，並在近月內加強至兌換範圍的強方，而銀行存款亦在本年持續增長。簡單而言，未觀察到香港貨幣或銀行體系出現明顯資金外流。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行體系的穩定，不僅反映我們體系的穩健，亦反映我們對體系的強大信心。這並非一夜之間發生，而是經過多年的努力，建立緩衝機制及加強監察，並輔以我們對社交媒體平台上謠言的迅速回應。\n\n我們多年來為雨天所做的準備，已為香港的貨幣及銀行體系建立穩固的根基及強大的緩衝。除了我們公眾資金內龐大的外匯儲備外，香港銀行體系亦擁有強大的資本緩衝、強健的流動性及極佳的資產質素，無論以國際或歷史標準來衡量。自2009年起實施的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，亦大大加強了銀行體系對房地產市場逆轉的抗風險能力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監督構成我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們亦不時加強監察及監督架構。除了緊密監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險外，我們今年的新舉措之一，是運用從銀行收集的科技及細緻資料，以更深入及適時的方式提升監察港元融資及金融市場活動的能力。同時，亦因應經濟及營運環境快速變化，加強壓力測試及應變計劃。\n\n事實上，我們強大而完善的監管制度已獲得國際社會的廣泛認可。今年，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定香港具有良好條件應對周期性及結構性變動，鑒於其具備重大緩衝能力。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資方面的有效法律及制度架構亦獲得金融行動特別任務組（FATF）正面評估，使香港成為亞太區內首個在FATF互認評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的根基，也是保障貨幣與金融穩定的關鍵。為維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能造成對香港貨幣或銀行體系懷疑的惡意謠言保持高度警覺，並迅速作出回應。這一點尤其重要，鑒於現今社會媒體和即時通訊的廣泛使用。在社會事件爆發期間，恐慌製造者在社交媒體平台上散播了各種謠言，我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速而明確地澄清這些謠言，證明這是一種有用且有效的做法，有助於釋除疑慮、制止不實謠言進一步傳播，並維持國際及公眾對我們體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，發揮著確保社會與經濟暢順運作的基本作用。儘管自下半年起營運環境困難，銀行仍與其他機構一同努力，竭盡全力維持核心功能的正常運作，並持續服務企業與公眾。\n\n除基本的銀行服務如存款及轉帳外，銀行的重要功能之一是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們清楚明白，並關切在困難經濟環境下，企業，特別是中小企所面對的資金週轉問題。在保障銀行穩定的同時，我們已推出一系列措施，以確保持續為中小企提供資金支持。特別是，銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率已在2019年10月及2020年3月兩次調降，總共下調150個基點至1.0%；銀行的監管存款準備金比率亦在2020年4月調降一半。這些措施釋放了約1萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多的空間，以向企業，包括中小企提供貸款。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，匯聚香港的主要銀行，共同探討及討論具體措施，以加強對中小企的資金支持。我很樂見不少銀行已積極響應我們的呼籲，為有需要的客戶推出如還息不還本等緩衝措施，以幫助他們克服難關。\n\n基於部分中小企反映開立銀行帳戶的困難，而這正是使用各項銀行服務的首個步驟，我們過去幾年一直致力應對此問題。我們的工作已見成效，企業開戶的改善情況可見。為進一步推動金融包容性，香港金融管理局推動推出分層帳戶服務——簡易帳戶（SBAs），並採用簡化的客戶盡職調查程序，為初創企業和中小企提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。截至目前為止，已開立超過2,800個簡易帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：實力不斷提升\n\n我們一直留意到需要在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡。鑒於金融中心之間激烈的競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其更長期的穩定。工作重點有四個範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫以及人才發展。\n\n# 迎向數位時代的科技\n\n香港自2016年設立香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室及2017年引入智能銀行計劃以來，一直在快速推動金融科技（金融科技）的發展。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活力可見於轉數快（FpS）系統的強大勢頭，轉數快是全球首個支持多幣種、跨行及電子錢包的實時零售支付平台。轉數快的登記數目在短短15個月內已達到四百萬，相當於750萬人口中高達百萬的滲透率。政府亦採用轉數快，為市民提供更方便的繳交稅款、差餉及水費方式。越來越多企業預期會使用這種快速、安全及方便的支付方式，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業界，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務營運方面已見重大進展。根據香港金融管理局進行的研究顯示，接近九成受訪的零售銀行已採用或正計劃採用人工智能於其業務應用。在香港金融管理局的協助下，銀行已開始應用大數據及消費者行為分析於個人信貸產品上。他們亦在首兩個階段推出了超過800個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋範疇廣泛的銀行產品及服務。雖然鼓勵銀行使用金融科技，我們亦沒有忽略在數字銀行服務中加強科技風險管理及消費者保護的需要。在這些範疇，已為銀行提供適時的監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行另一個極具興趣的領域，因其潛在能力可支持銀行更有效且有效益地進行合規及風險管理，特別是在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進行業更廣泛採用Regtech，並建立更廣的Regtech生態系統，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於11月舉辦了首屆AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發佈了首份Regtech通訊，討論Regtech的潛在應用情況。同時，作為銀行監管機構，HKMA亦正在探討運用監管科技（Suptech），包括新興數據科學及分析技術，以提升工作成效與效率。我們已開展一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年的Suptech落實藍圖。\n\n從更廣的角度來看，這只是金融科技在銀行業的旅程的開始。香港金融管理局於本年批出八份虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行已於2020年3月正式推出服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行則透過香港金融管理局的金融科技監管沙盒展開試點試行。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及為香港市民引入更多創新及多元的銀行服務，以提高我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n預期在國際層面亦有更多精彩的發展。在成功完成將我們的區塊鏈貿易融資平台 eTradeConnect 與其歐洲對接夥伴連接的試驗後，我們正進行另一個試驗，與中國人民銀行的平台合作，為跨境貿易的數碼化鋪路。我們已開始與泰國銀行合作進行聯合研究項目，研究央行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行亦於 11 月在香港啟用其首個創新中心，以促進中央銀行界內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展清楚顯示香港在全球金融科技發展中的領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色與可持續金融，邁向更好未來\n\n氣候相關風險近月備受全球關注。為貢獻全球應對此挑戰的努力，香港金融管理局於5月公布三項關鍵措施，以推動香港在不同領域發展綠色金融。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局正推動一個三個階段的途徑，以推動綠色及可持續銀行業。在第一階段，已制定一套用以評估銀行「綠色基準」的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定監管預期及要求，以及第三階段的落實鋪路。\n\n作為發行機構，香港金融管理局積極推動將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入其投資活動。具體而言，我們採用優先考慮綠色及ESG投資的原則，若其長線回報在風險調整後與其他投資相若。在2015年作為早期投資者之一進入綠色債券市場後，我們將繼續擴大綠色債券組合，並投資其他ESG資產。我們亦會與理念相近的投資者及監管機構攜手，透過參與ESG社群的國際組織，推動ESG的最佳實踐。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of

經濟與金融環境\n\n2019年，香港經濟在國際經濟減速、持續的中美貿易摩擦及本地社會事件的背景下回軟，同時勞動市場面臨增加的壓力。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健且有韌性，擁有強大資本基礎、充足的流動性及健康的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管面對困難的內外環境，香港的貨幣制度仍穩固維持，這反映於港元匯率的穩定及外匯及貨幣市場的暢順運作。這不僅反映香港貨幣制度的穩健，亦反映對香港貨幣制度的信心。\n\n引入了一項新決議機制，並在金管局修訂的流動性設施框架內作出若干優化措施。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局投放巨大努力以監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行體系穩定。在推動智能銀行方面亦有良好進展，包括授予八家虛擬銀行牌照及鼓勵採用監管科技。這些努力亦輔以加強對銀行科技風險管理的監督及加強數字金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n香港金融管理局理順投資者保障措施，以提升客戶經驗，同時採取進一步舉措推動以客戶為中心的銀行文化。\n\n香港的反洗錢及反恐融資制度獲得金融行動特別小組（FATF）給予正面評估，使其成為亞太區首個在FATF第四輪互認評估中取得整體合規結果的FATF成員司法管轄區。\n\n新規則及條例已推出，以符合最新國際標準，提升銀行監管制度。香港公布三階段方法，推動綠色及可持續銀行業，成為全球應對氣候變化的努力之一。\n\n同時，香港金融管理局在推動銀行的解決機制實務運作方面取得重大進展，特別是推動在國內系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收損失能力，以促進金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港的金融科技生態系統正持續增強，銀行業在開放應用程式介面框架的落實方面取得良好進展，並設立了全球首個國際貨幣基金組織創新中心，同時電子支付中使用更快支付系統的數量持續增加。\n\n香港保持堅定的立足點，作為離岸人民幣業務的全球中心。在廣東廣州-香港-澳門大灣區發展的背景下，香港與內地的金融聯繫不斷加強，香港居民獲取金融服務的便利性亦有所提升。\n\n大量努力作出以開放新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，特別是在基礎設施投資及融資、綠色金融及私人股權基金方面。\n\n香港財務學院設立旨在服務於培育財務領導才能及成為貨幣及財務研究，包括應用研究的知識庫之卓越中心。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n受惠於有利的投資環境，發行基金錄得第二高的投資收入，達2,622億港元，相當於投資回報率6.6%。\n\n香港金融管理局深化其在投資多元化方面的努力，尤其著重於長期增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP 自 2009 年成立以來，錄得年化內部報酬率達 12.6%。在推動責任投資方面亦有鼓舞人心的進展。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及營運的了解。\n\n在機構內，香港金融管理局重視透過支持員工專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律及提升資訊科技保安，以應對因落實新舉措及工作複雜度增加而帶來的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents.

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年出現收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、美國與中國貿易爭端持續以及本地社會事件。隨著年下半年經濟情況迅速惡化，勞動市場面對日益增加的壓力。由於豬肉價格急升，通脹亦有所增加。鑒於新型冠狀病毒爆發已對本已轉弱的經濟造成雪上加霜的影響，2020年經濟表現預期將持續困難。面對困難的經濟環境，政府與香港金融管理局已推出措施支持經濟，尤其支持家庭及中小企業。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 實際活動\n\n隨着2018年經濟增長2.9%，香港經濟在2019年出現1.2%的跌幅，這是自2009年以來首個年度收縮。特別是在下半年，經濟進入衰退，季節性調整後的實質國內生產總值（GDP）連續第二、第三及第四季下跌（見表1）。經濟活動的下跌反映本地需求出現顯著減少（見圖1）。由於本地社會事件在下半年對消費活動及情緒造成重大影響，私人消費開支出現自2003年以來的首個年度下跌。整體投資開支亦因商界情緒受抑而下跌。在外圍方面，全球經濟增長放緩及在美國與中國貿易摩擦之下徵收的額外關稅，導致香港貨物出口下跌。服務業出口亦出現有紀錄以來最大的年度跌幅，因社會事件導致入境旅遊情況嚴重轉差。由於國內及轉口引致的需求較小，貨物及服務進口亦出現下跌。淨額計算下，淨貿易在2019年對GDP帶來支持（見圖1），因總進口下跌速度甚至快過總出口。\n\n基於強大的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間引入多輪措施，以減輕居民的財務負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企以及受重創的行業，例如零售、食品服務、運輸及旅遊業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，並幫助緩和經濟週期，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.5%減至2.0%，從而讓銀行有更多靈活性，釋放HK$200至300億港元的銀行信貸予企業，包括中小企，並設立銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。此外，於9月引入了中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）的80%擔保產品的新纾困措施，讓面對資金流轉轉弱的中小企借款人可申請還息不還本安排，以獲得即時支援。進一步地，於12月引入了SFGS下的新90%貸款擔保產品，以提供額外支援予中小企、經營經驗相對較少的企業，以及尋求設立個人業務的專業人士，讓他們取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n2019年香港貨幣市場及港元匯率運作暢順有序。全年港元匯率大致穩定。隨著3月弱方保證措施被觸發，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，以每1美元7.85港元的匯率，向銀行購入港元及售出美元，導致總結餘額按設計方式下跌。港元銀行間利率在較長期部分大致維持穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，多間零售銀行於接近年底時，根據美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的下調，將最佳貸款利率調低12.5個基點。至於貨幣總量，2019年總銀行貸款增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所上升，而總存款則在該年增加2.9%。\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n扣除政府一次性纾缓措施影響後的基礎通脹率，於2019年微升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%略高。通脹的輕微上升，主要由於自5月起新鮮豬肉供應受阻，帶動豬肉價格上揚（圖2）。排除基本食品項目後，全年價格壓力大致維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費者物價通脹中的住宅部分，與新租私人住宅租金較早前的整理同步放緩。更廣泛而言，名義工資的輕微增長及商業租金較慢的上升，有助於控制本地企業成本。在外圍方面，進口物價通脹放緩，與香港一些主要進口來源的通脹下跌相符合，同時全球經濟增長放緩。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場整體表現仍具韌性，但下半年則面臨日益增加的壓力（圖3）。在首兩個季度維持在多年低點2.8%後，經季節調整的失業率在第三季上升至2.9%，第四季則攀升至3.3%。在社會事件的影響下，與消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率更顯著上升。整體勞動需求在下半年亦明顯收縮，總就業人數與私人部門空缺數目均下降。勞動需求減少的情況在零售、住宿及食品服務業，以及進出口貿易和建設業中尤為明顯。在供給方面，勞動參與率則輕微下降，部分是因應經濟衰退而產生的周期性反應。隨著勞動市場壓力不斷增加，名義工資與薪資的成長在年底出現減速跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了劇烈波動。在首四個月市場一度攀升後，由於美國與中國貿易摩擦再度升溫，恒生指數在5月急跌（圖4）。雖然在6月因主要央行顯示較為寬鬆的貨幣政策而部分回復跌幅，但股市在經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件的影響下，再度承受壓力。年尾時，股市在美國與內地達成「第一階段」貿易協議後，重拾上升勢頭。恒生指數以28,190點收市，全年整體升幅達9.1%。相對而言，平均每日成交額較去年同期下跌約19%。一家重大內地科技公司及一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，幫助透過首次公開招股（IpOs）籌集的股本資金增至2019年的3,142億港元。香港在透過IpOs籌集資金方面，連續第二年高踞全球首位。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2019年首五個月住宅物業市場出現強勁反彈，但整體而言，其餘時間市場則有所軟化。2019年初市場氣氛有所改善，部分原因是因為美國與中國貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時減輕，但隨後因美國與中國貿易摩擦再度升級、持續的社會事件以及內地經濟情況惡化，市場氣氛再度受壓。整體住宅物業價格從5月高峰至12月回落5%，但因首五個月出現10%的反彈，全年仍錄得5%的年增長（圖4）。2019年物業交易量較上年增加4%，達59,797宗，反映年初交易活動強勁。住宅物業可負擔性仍然偏緊，價格與收入比率及收入負擔比率分別維持在17.9及80.9的高水平，遠高於其長線平均值。為協助有即時住房需求的買家，香港按揭貸款證券化有限公司（HKMC）於10月中調高了符合按揭保險計劃貸款資格的已落成住宅物業價值上限。另一方面，2019年非住宅物業市場面對較強的下行壓力。特別是零售物業的價格及租金自2008年全球金融危機以來出現最大幅度的下跌，反映當年營商環境持續惡化。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2020年經濟表現預期將非常困難，與新型冠狀病毒爆發相關的短期下行風險重大。一些行業，例如零售、住宿、食品服務、旅遊及運輸，尚未從社會事件所造成的干擾中復原，將會受到雙重打擊。然而，2020\/21財政預算中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金發放及在SFGS下提供額外低息貸款（政府擔保100%），預期將為經濟提供一定支持，尤其對家庭及中小企而言。2020年3月16日，香港金融管理局進一步將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率從2.0%調降至1.0%，這將讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，特別是那些預期會因新型冠狀病毒爆發影響而經歷額外短期壓力的行業及個人。從GDP組成部分分析，私人消費及投資預期將維持疲弱，因消費者及企業信心脆弱。雖然政府消費將貢獻經濟增長，但公共投資開支預期在一些重大基礎設施項目完成後將相對緩慢。在外圍方面，美國與內地之間的「第一階段」貿易協議被評估為在短期內對本地經濟略為正面。然而，香港的外貿表現仍將受到全球經濟增長疲弱及貿易流動放緩的影響。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發可能導致地區供應鏈中斷及跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，從而抑制香港的出口。政府預測2020年實際GDP增長將在-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織及私人分析機構的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n\n通貨膨脹壓力預期在2020年會因經濟狀況不佳、私人住宅租賃的整併以及輕微的進口通貨膨脹而趨於溫和。市場共識預測2020年的 headline 通貨膨脹率為1.8%，政府預期 headline 通貨膨脹率和基礎通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動市場方面，鑒於經濟前景疲軟及冠狀病毒爆發，近期内失業率可能進一步上升。私人部門分析師預期2020年的失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年經濟前景偏弱，受到多項不確定性及風險影響，包括來自全球經濟放緩、中美貿易關係、內地經濟表現、地方社會事件以及新型冠狀病毒爆發持續的影響。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發若持續延長，可能會導致更明顯的全球經濟放緩，並引發資產重新定價，進而導致不利的宏觀經濟環境與更緊縮的金融條件，進一步對國內實體經濟造成下行壓力。然而，主要央行更為共同的貨幣政策寬鬆努力，可能提供緩衝，以抵消疫情對經濟造成的負面影響。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在2019年面對全球經濟放緩、美國與中國貿易摩擦及本地社會事件等困難環境下，表現仍具韌性。銀行業的資產負債表趨勢保持穩定，貸款及存款均以適度速度增長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況仍然穩固，資產質素亦維持良好。銀行業持續錄得盈利，平均資產回報率保持穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣穩定\n\n2019年香港美元匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。全年香港美元匯率保持穩定，並在年底加強至兌換範圍的強方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其對衝擊的強大抗壓能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持穩定，匯率維持在 HK$7.75 至 HK$7.85 區間內。貨幣體系的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少 100% 由存放在發行基金內的美元儲備所支持，並要求貨幣基礎的變動與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n欠據，提供十足支持予三間發行紙幣的銀行\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中的總餘額，即銀行存放在香港金融管理局的結算賬戶餘額合共\n\n由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發票及紙幣（EFBNs）\n\n香港貨幣兌換率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制及金管局對履行兌換承諾 (CUs) 的堅定承諾而保持。當對港元的需求大於供應，且市場兌換率強勢上揚至 7.75 港元兌 1 美元的強方兌換範圍上限時，金管局會準備好應銀行的要求出售港元以換取美元。此時總結餘將擴展，推動港元利率下降，創造貨幣條件使港元兌美元由強方上限回復至 7.75 至 7.85 的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供應大於需求，且市場兌換率下跌至 7.85 港元兌 1 美元的弱方兌換範圍下限時，金管局會準備好應銀行的要求買入港元。此時總結餘將收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元兌美元由弱方下限回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 經濟穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，且本地經濟放緩，港元在2019年仍然維持穩定，並以暢順有序的方式進行交易。年初時，負的港元對美元息差擴大，吸引沽出港元、買入美元的套利活動，推動港元匯率接近7.85的弱方兌換範圍（圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續轉弱，港元在3月最終觸發了八次弱方兌換範圍。其後，港元繼續維持在7.85的弱方兌換範圍附近。自5月下旬起，因規模龐大的首次公開招股（IPO）活動、企業對股息支付的需求以及半年結算，帶來強勁的港元需求，推動港元走強。雖然在半年結算後港元一度下跌，但自10月下旬起，港元恢復勢頭，並在年底維持在兌換範圍的強方。這部分反映與資本市場相關的需求，包括新股集資，也部分反映因年底流動性收緊而平倉沽出港元的行為。整體而言，港元匯市在2019年運作正常。\n\n由於觸發了弱方維持貨幣兌換率（weak-side CU），整體結餘（扣除貼現窗口後）及未償還的發票債券（EFBNs）由2018年底的11,362億港元下跌至2019年底的11,330億港元（圖2）。在該年度內，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，應銀行的要求，在弱方維持貨幣兌換率7.85的情況下，購入總計221億港元的發票債券，導致整體結餘（扣除貼現窗口後）由2018年底的764億港元減少至2019年底的543億港元。在該年度內，未償還的發票債券由1,0598億港元輕微增加至10,787億港元，反映根據既定慣例發行發票債券以吸收發票債券的利息支付。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足由外匯儲備支持。2019年底總體結餘（扣除貼現窗口後）及未償還發票債券總額為1,133億港元。\n\n# 財務市場\n\n2019年期間，香港美元銀行同业利率在較長期部分大致維持穩定，而短期利率則大致回升（圖3）。短期利率亦因與新股集資相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需求而出現更多波動。自2018年4月以來，總結餘額的減少，可能導致香港美元銀行同业利率對本地市場港元資金供求變動的敏感度提高。\n\n利率在2018年底為2.75%，於8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共下调75個基點，降至11月初的2.00%。此舉是因美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍在當年共三次下调總計75個基點，由2.25–2.50%調降至1.50–1.75%。在11月18日至26日及12月19日至31日期間，利率被設置高於2.00%，反映年底兩個月內香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）出現顯著上漲趨勢。因此，2019年底利率收報2.49%。利率調整是根據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式進行，該公式設置利率為美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍現行下限之上50個基點，或為香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）的五日移動平均數的平均值，取較高者。在零售方面，多家零售銀行在10月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下降後，將最佳貸款利率調低12.5個基點。\n\n香港美元期貨點數的貼現於首兩個月擴闊，大致跟隨香港美元與美元息差的變化，12個月期的香港美元期貨點數於2月中達至約-708點（圖4）。其後，隨著香港美元與美元息差的負值收窄，香港美元期貨點數的貼現亦逐步收窄，並在年底轉為 premiums。整體而言，香港的資金市場運作有序。2019年，貼現窗口貸款減少至383億港元，較2018年的402億港元減少。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\nLERS對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了大幅貢獻，超過過去數十年，並在多項區域及全球金融危機中展現出其強韌性。在本年社會事件發生的背景下，一些無根據的謠言在媒體上流通，懷疑LERS及香港的金融穩定。香港金融管理局果斷而積極地反駁這些謠言，並透過傳統及社會媒體釋除公眾疑慮，重申LERS將仍然維持現狀，香港不會實行外匯或資本管制。此外，香港金融管理局亦發出數篇文章，幫助公眾了解LERS的運作、資金流動及利率前景。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對LERS的信心，反映市場全年運作有序。政府亦堅定支持LERS。公眾對政府承諾及香港元作為支付手段及保值方式的信心，亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步鞏固。在2019年對香港的第四條諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定其一向支持LERS作為香港金融穩定的基石，並指出LERS仍然是香港適當的匯率安排，其基礎為香港透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系流動性高且穩健，流動性狀況及資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業貸款、物業相關貸款及內地相關貸款的監管努力。與上一年相比，銀行的總結餘較低，銀行普遍已加強流動性管理安排，並在日常資金安排上更加積極主動。此外，香港金融管理局持續與銀行保持緊密溝通，以確保市場流動性能暢順地循環，尤其在大型首次公開招股的認購期前後及期間。本年期間未見結算癱瘓的情況，貼現窗口繼續有效且高效地運作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將一部分貨幣發行基金資產分配用以支持貨幣基礎。後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）在2019年內波動於109.9%至112.1%之間，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率在12月31日收報111.2%（圖5）。根據貨幣發行局條例，雖然已指定部分貨幣發行基金資產用作後備組合，但所有貨幣發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在面對突發衝擊時，貨幣發行基金龐大的財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將提供強大的支持，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行委員會小組 (CBC) 負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2019年，CBC 考慮了包括對LERS營運的事件研究、香港整體結餘與利率之間的關係、有關LERS的選擇權市場觀點的提升及更靈活的處理方式，以及未來首次公開招股對HIBOR的影響等議題。CBC就這些議題進行的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會營運報告，已於香港金融管理局網站上刊登。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究所以前稱為香港貨幣研究所以來，一直致力於進行與政策相關的貨幣政策、銀行及金融等主題的研究。這一點反映在香港研究人員及海外訪問學者所探討的廣泛主題，以及該會舉辦的會議和活動之中。香港貨幣及金融研究所與各主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦以政策為重點的會議。其研究訪問計劃支持與香港金融管理局、香港及區內相關的重要政策問題有關的研究項目。\n\n2019年，香港國際金融研究中心接待了14位研究學者，刊登了17篇工作論文，並舉辦了11場涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融等廣泛議題的公開研討會。該中心亦舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n第十屆年度國際中國經濟會議，題為「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由香港國際金融研究中心、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心財政研究所聯合舉辦。該會議為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家提供了一個世界級的論壇，討論在金融改革所引入的變化及中國經濟發展背景下，中國大陸金融部門所面對的風險相關議題。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2019年仍然保持穩健及穩定，儘管受到全球及本地經濟轉弱所帶來的逆風影響。由於行業的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件期間繼續正常運作。為確保對公眾造成的不便盡可能減至最低，已採取相關措施。在該年度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）專注於對授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理。考慮到網絡威脅不斷升級，以及行業對科技的依賴不斷增長，HKMA加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，HKMA精簡其投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。我們亦加強了在數位金融服務中的消費者保護，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組對香港AML\/CFT制度的第四輪互認評估結論，該評估認為香港的AML\/CFT制度整體符合標準且有效，特別是對銀行業良好風險了解以及香港金融管理局在AML\/CFT方面的風險為本監管工作給予正面評價。香港金融管理局持續參與針對詐騙及洗錢的智能分享公私合作計劃，並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，香港金融管理局於2019年批出（牌照）八間虛擬銀行，並公布一個三個階段的方案，以促進香港綠色及可持續銀行的發展。香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監管政策及程序，並推行能力建設計劃，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，有關國際監管標準的本地落實工作已取得重大進展，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額 exposures 標準。香港金融管理局亦繼續其工作，以確保 authorised institutions 會有可信的處置機制，包括實施有關吸收損失能力要求的規則，以提升 authorised institutions 的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於金融體系具高度韌性，並能夠提供香港經濟所必需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營業務的方式，可能影響整個系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，亦可能以混亂的方式失敗。作為監管當局，貨幣當局在確保銀行具備對衝擊的韌性，並能在危機中恢復其地位方面發揮關鍵作用，從而最終協助防止失敗。貨幣當局負責監管香港的銀行的審慎監管。其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構合稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。貨幣當局亦負責某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監察。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保一個零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為一個處置當局，致力確保在認可機構變得不可持續時，其失敗情況可以以有序的方式處理。為此，香港已設立一套處置機制，根據該機制，貨幣管理局為認可機構的處置當局。為確保香港的處置機制能夠運作，制定處置法律及政策標準、進行處置計劃以移除影響認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及提升貨幣管理局處理失敗認可機構的運作能力，至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，貨幣管理局採用國際上協調一致的處理方式。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2019年，共進行了196項非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛的議題，包括資本充足率評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為香港金融管理局持續推動強化風險治理的一部分，其與本地發牌機構董事會或董事層委員會舉行了26場會議。此外，香港金融管理局亦與本地發牌機構及其外部核數師舉行了32場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，香港金融管理局亦進行定期現場檢查，並配合針對高風險範疇的主題評估。本年共進行了405次現場檢查及主題評估。信用風險管理仍然為這些檢查及評估的重點。另一重大重點則為科技風險及運作風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及落實巴塞爾資本充足框架的現場檢查及主題評估數目。同時，專門團隊亦進行了對證券、投資產品、保險及與強制性退休金計劃（MPF）相關企業活動的現場檢查及主題評估。\n\n表1載有香港金融管理局2019年監管活動的整體概要。\n\n# 信用風險管理\n\n# 信用成長與資產品質\n\n2019年銀行貸款增幅溫和。總貸款額增長6.7%，相比2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款及用於香港以外地區的貸款分別增長7.7%及5.8%。\n\n與內地相關貸款於2019年底增至HK$4,564億，按年增長7.4%（表3）。\n\nAI 的資產質素仍然健康。零售銀行的違約貸款比率自 2018 年年底的 0.51% 輕微下降至 2019 年年底的 0.48%，遠低於自 2000 年以來的長期歷史平均值 2%。整體銀行業的違約貸款比率則從 0.55% 輕微上升至 0.57%。具體而言，在與內地相關的貸款方面，零售銀行的違約貸款比率從 2018 年的 0.63% 上升至 2019 年的 0.79%，仍低於歷史水平。整體銀行業的比率則從一年前的 0.55% 上升至 0.75%。\n\n全年期間，香港金融管理局加強了監管努力，確保在經濟環境不確定的情況下，授權機構持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。償付能力壓力測試已加強，以涵蓋更全面的風險範疇及採用更嚴重的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行一般擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極為嚴重的衝擊。為評估授權機構在不同範疇的信貸風險管理實務，包括對從事高風險業務的企業的貸款、複雜的融資安排，以及對私人銀行及資產管理客戶的擔保貸款，香港金融管理局進行了針對性及主題性的審查。鑑於中小企在經濟下行期間可能面臨更大挑戰，香港金融管理局於10月設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，以鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則所允許的範圍內，繼續支持中小企的融資需要。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n香港銀行業對樓市逆轉的抗風險能力，自2009年起，因香港金融管理局引入八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施而大幅加強。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）在2019年12月降至53%，較2009年9月首次引入逆周期措施前的64%有所下降。新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%，降至2019年12月的36%（圖1）。\n\n# 操作與科技風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）採用三個階段的方法，以實施網絡韌性評估框架，作為網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）的一部分。第一階段評估，涵蓋所有重大銀行，已在2018年完成。第二及第三階段所涵蓋的其他人工智能（AIs）亦已按時 substantially 完成評估。鑒於過去數年的經驗，HKMA亦已開展對CFI的全面檢討，以進一步完善該計劃。\n\n十月，香港金融管理局發佈了有關「電子銀行風險管理」的監管政策手冊（SPM）修訂模組。此次修訂旨在為業界提供更大的靈活性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。香港金融管理局亦刊登了一套高層原則，用以指引業界在使用人工智能方面的應用。\n\n自6月社會事件開始以來，香港金融管理局一直與業界保持緊密溝通，監察對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）並盡快修復遭破壞的設施。香港金融管理局亦迅速採取行動，反駁惡意謠言，以維護公眾對銀行體系的信心。由於銀行業界作出共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施已盡快恢復正常服務，並將對公眾造成的不便減至最低。考慮到社會事件帶來的營運風險不斷上升，銀行被要求採取額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理的監督\n\n本年度進行了一輪主題審查，以評估銀行機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點為銀行機構流動性壓力測試計劃及應急資金管理的穩健性。香港金融管理局亦評估銀行機構遵守有關流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）計算規則的合規情況，以確保用以計算的輸入資料的謹慎性及準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業日益流行，香港金融管理局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估人工智能在該領域的風險管理做法。考慮到倫敦銀行間拆借利率（LIBOR）可能在年底2021後停止刊登，香港金融管理局提醒人工智能機構做好轉向替代參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查以監察他們對轉換的準備情況。\n\n# 反洗錢及反恐融資（ML\/TF）\n\n香港金融管理局推行以風險為本的監管方式，監察信貸機構的反洗錢\/反恐融資系統。本年進行了18次現場審查及61次非現場檢討，包括針對私人銀行及新科技應用的治理進行主題性審查。香港金融管理局就信貸機構應用以風險為本的反洗錢\/反恐融資控制措施，針對中小企的情況進行主題性審查，並與業界分享由此所得的觀察結果及最佳實踐，以協助信貸機構採用適當的中小企帳戶開立程序及相關服務。\n\n# 金融行動任務組 (FATF) 互認評估 (ME) 報告書：香港\n\n2019年香港金融管理局及香港整體反洗錢\/反恐融資（AML\/CFT）制度的亮點之一，是於9月發表了金融行動特別小組（FATF）對香港的ME報告。該報告代表了FATF第四輪ME評估中，其成員司法管轄區所取得的最佳整體成果之一。在香港的評估中，其AML\/CFT制度在11項「即時成效」評級中獲得了六項「重大成效」評級，並在ME的技術合規方面獲得高分。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局以風險為本的反洗錢\/反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管方法表示贊成，指出香港金融管理局對銀行業的洗錢\/恐怖融資（ML\/TF）風險有良好了解，對儲值支付工具（SVF）業的風險亦有合理了解。報告亦對銀行業的集體AML\/CFT努力表示支持，例如較大的人工智能（AI）機構增加使用數據分析、大部分可疑交易報告均由AI機構提交，以及業界積極參與訛騙及洗錢智能（人工智能）任務小組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議多項改善範疇，包括對一些高風險領域的了解，例如外國貪污及稅務犯罪，以及正在培育的領域如特殊目的實體（SVFs）。有關建議的應對工作已經開始；香港金融管理局於七月刊登了有關SVF領域的修訂客戶盡職調查（ML\/TF）風險評估，並已開始針對私人銀行及新科技應用的治理進行主題性現場審查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last

透過「銀行業務更容易」計劃，進一步促進監管科技（Regtech）的應用。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局銀行部共同發揮推動落實這些計劃的關鍵作用。\n\n香港在促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面發揮不可或缺的作用，透過「滬港通」及「債券通」計劃，香港擁有無與倫比的准入權限，可接觸內地市場。這一點在過去一年內可見，「債券通」註冊投資者數目及每日成交額均增長兩倍。為進一步提升便利性及靈活性，「債券通」及「滬港通」均引入了進一步的改進措施，使國際投資者更易於在內地投資證券。香港金融管理局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探索及實施一系列金融便利措施，讓香港居民可在廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA）內跨境使用金融及銀行服務，包括一個預期的兩方式財富管理連通計劃。香港保持堅定的立足點，作為離岸人民幣業務的全球中心。根據國際清算銀行（BIS）的外匯（FX）及衍生產品市場成交額三週年調查，香港繼續為全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n持續投入努力以開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為推動香港的基金業務發展，香港金融管理局與政府及業界緊密合作，提供更為利好的稅務及監管環境，以促進基金設立。為推廣香港作為綠色金融、基礎設施投資與融資及企業財務中心（CTCs）的樞紐，舉辦了一系列大型活動及針對性宣傳推廣行動。為提升香港的軟實力，香港金融學院（AoF）於6月設立，以培育金融領導人才並推動研究合作。\n\n在貨幣當局及監管界別中，香港金融管理局在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。香港金融管理局曾於2019年8月31日前擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管與合作監督委員會（SRC）主席。現時，香港金融管理局正擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）監管與落實小組（SIG）主席，以及亞太區中央銀行高級管理人員會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場小組（WGFM）主席。香港金融管理局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同擔任FSB非銀行監測專家小組（NMEG）主席。\n\n香港金融基建的穩固運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的角色奠定了堅實的根基。2019年，四個銀行間實時總額結算系統（RTGS）、中央貨幣市場部門（CMU）及香港儲存庫（HKTR）取得100%系統可用性，超越了99.95%的目標。透過在兩家內地中央證券登記結算機構設立的帳戶，CMU協助進行債券通北向交易的結算，並代表相關CMU會員持有內地債務證券。\n\n作為香港美元實時結算系統的延伸，FPS 使公眾可於全天候的基礎上，即時進行跨不同銀行及儲值支付工具（SVF）的零售資金轉帳及付款。FPS 在運作首年表現順利。用戶對該項服務的採用情況持續增加，截至2019年底，登記數目已達四百萬，交易量更增長兩倍。FPS為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，香港金融管理局已根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定並監察總共六個零售支付系統（RPSs）。香港金融管理局亦於5月發出兩張新的儲值支付工具（SVF）牌照，使SVF牌照持有人數目增至18。SVF牌照持有人在今年繼續積極推出新產品及服務，以多元化客戶選擇及提升用戶體驗。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 亞洲的金融科技中心：香港\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n香港金融管理局於2017年9月公布七項智能銀行措施，旨在協助銀行業取得更高水平的運作標準，並把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。當年在實施這些措施及轉型香港金融科技生態系統方面，已作出大量進展。\n\n# 更快的付款系統\n\n2018年9月推出轉數快，是香港在數字時代金融基礎建設發展的重要里程碑。轉數快進一步推動香港採用電子支付，為大眾及企業提供高效及方便的支付服務。自轉數快推出以來，參與服務供應商的數目已增加至30間銀行及11間SVF，至2019年底更增加9間銀行及1間SVF。\n\nFPS 的用量亦持續穩步增長。截至 2019 年 12 月 31 日，FPS 記錄了四百萬個登記數目（圖 1），並處理了涉及總金額達 HK$7485 億及人民幣 17 億的 4400 萬筆交易。在 2019 年 12 月，平均每日成交額達到 168,000 笔交易，價值 HK$24 億及人民幣 3800 萬（圖 2），相較於其於 2018 年 10 月首個運作月的 51,000 笔交易。\n\n更快支付系統記錄：\n- 2019年12月31日累計登記數目為4百萬\n- 2019年12月31日累計交易數目為44百萬\n- 2019年12月交易總額為HK$24億及人民幣38百萬，平均每日成交額為168,000筆\n\n香港金融管理局與業界合作，將轉數快的使用範圍從個人對個人付款擴展至賬單付款及其他商戶付款。例如，作出改進，使商戶能夠利用不同種類的代理識別符號，並透過二維碼接受部分或過度付款。已制定技術規範，以促進從商業手機應用程式啟動手機銀行或SVF電子錢包應用程式（應用程序）進行轉數快付款。這將大大改善客戶透過手機設備使用轉數快進行商戶及商業付款的經驗。\n\n香港金融管理局亦緊密與相關政府部門合作，協助他們利用FPS接受公眾的付款。自11月1日起，財政科、差餉物業估價署及水務署發出的發票已印有FPS二維碼，公眾可容易地透過支援的流動銀行應用程式或SVF電子錢包應用程式掃描該二維碼以進行付款。香港金融管理局會繼續與各項政府部門及公共機構合作，探索其他潛在應用場景，以使公眾能方便地透過FPS進行付款。\n\n為提高公眾對轉數快的認識，香港金融管理局已推出一系列教育及宣傳資料，例如為電視及電台播放而製作的「為公眾利益」宣傳短片，以及用於數碼平台的視頻及電子橫幅。香港金融管理局亦參與展覽會，以推動轉數快中小企及企業。各項參與轉數快的銀行及支付通訊服務提供者亦推出了推廣活動，並提供鼓勵措施，以鼓勵客戶在轉數快註冊，並用轉數快進行資金轉賬及支付賬單。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局委聘了一些行業組織及機構，為FPS提供簡介，以介紹其功能，以及它可能為不同企業在收款及付款方面帶來的潛在福利。\n\n政府已採用轉數快以處理稅項、地租及政府水費的付款。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n香港金融管理局繼續促進銀行業在根據開放API框架的四階段方法下發展及採用開放API。在第一階段，20間零售銀行於一月開立超過500個開放API端點，涵蓋銀行產品及服務的資訊。在第二階段，銀行於10月開立超過300個API以支持銀行產品及服務的應用。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n在貿易融資方面，於本年首個季度已完成連結eTradeConnect與we.trade的試驗研究。11月，香港銀行清算結算有限公司的子公司與中國人民銀行數位貨幣研究所簽署了《諒解備忘錄》（MoU），以進行連結eTradeConnect與人民銀行貿易融資平台的試驗研究，為香港與內地企業提供更方便的貿易融資服務。\n\n在香港金融管理局與泰國銀行就貨幣數位化（CBDC）展開合作研究項目「Inthanon-LionRock」，以研究CBDC在跨境付款應用的可行性，並促進香港與泰國銀行間港元與泰銖的付款對付款（PVP）安排。\n\n香港金融管理局金融基礎設施高級總監彭志豪先生（左起首個），與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所所長穆长春先生（右起首個），共同見證簽署一份《諒解備忘錄》，以進行將eTradeConnect與中國人民銀行貿易融資平台連接的試驗。該《諒解備忘錄》由香港貿易融資平台有限公司首席執行官唐慧星女士（左起第二個）與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所副所長兼深圳金融科技研究院院長迪革先生（右起第二個）簽署。\n\n關於人工智能（AI），香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了一項研究，探討人工智能技術在香港銀行業的應用。一項行業-wide 的AI調查的關鍵發現於11月刊登，隨後於12月發佈了題為「以人工智能重塑銀行業」的完整報告。\n\n報告「以人工智慧重塑銀行業」於12月刊登。\n\n一份資料單張已刊登，用以突出從有關香港銀行業使用人工智能的調查中得出的關鍵事實和數字。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局繼續與其戰略夥伴合作推行「金融科技事業加速器計劃2.0」，以培育各階段的年輕人才。去年超過220名學生受惠於該計劃。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in

資產管理\n\n全球金融市場在2019年表現優於預期，因主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的影響大於對全球增長放緩及中美貿易摩擦的擔憂。全球股市在2018年第4季經歷重大調整後隨着反彈，同時主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上升。在這樣一個利好的環境下，證券基金在2019年錄得投資收入達2,622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n證券交易所基金的首要目標，如《證券交易所基金條例》所制定，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的交換價值。該基金亦可被運用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以幫助香港維持其國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局根據財政司司長（FS）所轉授的授權，並在授權條款內，就證券交易所基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 財政儲備基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會（EFAC）已為證券交易所基金設立以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎在任何時候均十足由高度流動性的美元資產支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 依(a)至(c)之條件，取得投資回報，以幫助維持基金之長線實力。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮發行機構的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合中。\n\n大致上，發行基金有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流動性的美元資產，以提供十足的資本支持貨幣基礎，符合貨幣板制度的規定。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保本其資產價值及長線購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及在長線提升回報，香港金融管理局以審慎及逐步的方式，將發行基金的部分投資分散至更多元的資產類別。此舉包括新興市場及內地債券及股票、私人股權（包括基礎設施）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券及股票由貨幣發行保證基金（IP）持有，而私人股權及房地產投資則由長線增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP下投資的市場價值上限，設立為發行基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及與LTGP掛鈎的發行基金及子公司所作投資的部份。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年設立，持有香港交易所及清算有限公司的股份，該股份是由政府為交易所基金的戰略目的而購入。由於其獨特性，此組合未被納入基金投資表現的評估範疇內。\n\n# 與發行基金的安排\n\n發行局有時會接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款安排。利率一般與IP表現掛鈎，但未來基金為例外，其利率與IP及LTGP掛鈎，並根據投資組合的組成情況而定。截至2019年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券交易所基金的投資過程是以兩種資產配置類型的決定為基礎：戰略性資產配置及戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資指標上，代表證券交易所基金根據其投資目標所作出的長線資產配置。以戰略性配置為指引，資產會進行戰術性配置，爭取取得高於指標的超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與指標（或戰略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與指標配置之間的差距稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然指標及追蹤誤差上限是由FS與EFAC協商後確定，但戰術性決定及戰術性偏離的允許範圍則由香港金融管理局在授權下作出設立。在戰術性偏離允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以設立倉位，以利用短期市場變化。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局於2018年8月設立發行基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以統籌其投資及相關風險管理功能。EFIO的職員直接管理發行基金約71%的投資，包括整個BP及IP的部分。IP的這部分包括一組投資於全球定息市場的投資組合，以及各項衍生工具覆蓋組合，用以實施為基金進行宏觀風險管理的策略。\n\n# 外部管理機構的使用\n\n除內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦聘請外部資產管理機構管理約29%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部管理機構的目的是以爭取市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，汲取多樣化且互補的投資風格，並取得其市場見解及投資方面的技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費及託管費用、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的複雜度不斷增長，突顯了風險管理的重要性。為內置及外置管理的投資組合，均已設有嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規則的遵守情況。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估已加強，以支持發行基金投資多元化程度的增加。風險控制工具被用來評估在正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以物色績效來源，支持香港金融管理局評估如何最有效地運用內置及外置管理者的投資技巧。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素併入交易所基金對公眾及私人市場投資的投資過程，以推動負責任投資（RI）。\n\n就公眾市場投資而言，香港金融管理局（HKMA）實施與程序相關及與投資相關的措施。香港金融管理局所採取的一項與程序相關的措施，是採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《負責任擁有原則》（PRO），以幫助投資者決定如何最佳地履行其在香港上市公司的投資相關責任。在管理發行基金方面，香港金融管理局已制定內部指引，涵蓋與外部基金經理的甄選、委任及監督過程相關的環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素。香港金融管理局所委任的外部基金經理，負責管理其在香港股市及內地活躍股市組合的投資，須根據「符合或說明」的原則遵守PRO；而負責管理香港金融管理局在成熟市場股市組合的外部基金經理，則須遵守國際認可的ESG標準。除了外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦已納入香港金融管理局內部管理債券投資的信貸風險分析中。\n\n有關公眾市場的ESG投資，香港金融管理局自2015年起已投資綠色債券，作為此市場的早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司推行的管理共同貸款組合計劃，專注於跨過新興市場的可持續投資。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續透過直接投資或投資綠色債券基金來擴大其綠色債券組合。香港金融管理局亦計劃透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的參考指標，並聘用應用ESG因素於其投資決定的主動股票經理人，以建立以ESG為主題的股票投資策略。\n\n關於私人市場投資，香港金融管理局（HKMA）會在盡職調查過程中檢視普通合伙人（General Partners）的環境、社會及管治（ESG）政策及實踐。特別地，ESG風險評估是所有長期資產投資（LTGP）盡職調查的必備部分。對於LTGP，香港金融管理局投資具可持續特點的項目；例如，自2013年起，香港金融管理局已投資可再生能源，包括能源領域的直接及共同投資，以及具綠色及可持續特點的綠色建築及倉庫，這些項目均屬於其不動產投資組合。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續尋找具可持續特點的項目，並將綠色認證作為不動產投資的重要因素。\n\n香港金融管理局會緊密監察環境、社會及管治標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何能進一步融入其投資過程。此過程有賴其與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。特別地，作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則的簽署方，而該原則是全球領先的責任投資倡議平台，香港金融管理局預期會參與制定環境、社會及管治的最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦為FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織為非牟利機構，透過研討會及研究工作，致力於鼓勵企業及投資決策中融入長遠觀點。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露任務小組的支持者。\n\n如需了解香港金融管理局的RI政策框架更多細則，請參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2019年金融市場\n\n儘管對全球經濟成長減速及中美貿易摩擦的擔憂，全球金融市場在2019年仍表現良好，這得益於主要央行寬鬆的貨幣政策。在2018年第4季經歷重大調整後，全球股市在2019年出現反彈。在債券市場方面，主要國家政府債券收益率顯著下跌，而債券價格在2019年首三個季度因貨幣寬鬆而上漲。儘管第4季債券價格因收益率略為反彈而回落，但債券市場整體表現仍屬滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場上，主要貨幣對美元表現不一。由於中美貿易摩擦升溫，人民幣在第三季下跌了3.8%；但因貿易摩擦有所緩和，人民幣在第四季恢復了部分較早前的跌幅。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。雖然英鎊因無協議脫離歐盟的風險增加，在第三季下跌了3.2%；但隨著脫離歐盟的相關情況在第四季明朗化，英鎊最終反彈並對美元升值了4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n金管局在2019年記錄了HK$2,622億的投資收益。此收益包括債券收益HK$1,145億、香港股票收益HK$221億、其他股票收益HK$1,007億、非港元資產的負匯率影響HK$130億，以及基金投資持倉子公司持有的其他投資收益HK$379億。另一方面，戰略投資組合記錄了HK$2.5%的評值收益。\n\n交易所基金的總資產在年底達到4,206.7億港元。長期資產管理計劃（LTGP）下的投資總值為335.1億港元，其中私人股權為233.4億港元，不動產為101.7億港元。未償還的投資承諾達到219.3億港元。\n\n2019年交易所基金的投資回報（不計戰略投資組合）為6.6%。具體而言，IP取得9.7%的回報率，而BP則獲利2.5%。LTGP自2009年成立以來，已記錄年化內部報酬率達12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體平台、其網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及營運的了解。在機構內，作出認真努力以改善香港金融管理局的公司治理，包括支持員工專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律、提升資訊科技保安及推動創新文化，以應對因落實新措施及工作複雜度增加而帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 聘用社區\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度，並推動公眾對其政策及工作有更深入的了解。在本年內，共舉辦了125場開放的傳媒活動，包括10場記者會、12場即場訪問及103場其他公開活動。另外，亦安排了25場媒體訪問。共發佈了466份雙語新聞發佈稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局舉辦了針對本地及海外媒體以及社區內重要意見領袖的媒體簡報會及教育研討會，以促進對廣泛主題的了解，例如聯繫匯率制度（LERS）、虛擬銀行、綠色金融及香港作為競爭力國際金融中心等。\n\n自2018年7月起，香港金融管理局已推出各項社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育及溝通。現時有五個社交媒體渠道正在運作：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube，截至2019年底，總共擁有超過45,000名用戶。在2019年下半年的社會事件之下，香港金融管理局利用社交媒體以回應有關銀行營運及金融穩定的無根據謠言，此舉被證明在散播事實及防止謠言進一步散播方面具有高度成效。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一種有效方式，以更好地了解香港金融管理局的主要功能及營運情況。2019年共處理了9,742宗查詢，其中約一半的查詢與銀行政策及規則、消費者銀行服務及紙幣和硬幣有關。一些顯著的查詢包括有關硬幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通告、轉數快系統（FPS）以及貨幣及經濟統計資料。\n\n圖1顯示自2016年起接獲的公眾查詢數目，圖2則提供2019年按查詢性質的分類。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁黃循財先生在香港銀行協會傑出演講者午宴上發言。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁黃循禮（左）與當時香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖會見媒體，以公布黃循禮獲委任為香港金融管理局下任總裁的消息。\n\n# 研究報告\n\n除了香港金融管理局年度報告外，2019年香港金融管理局亦刊登了兩份半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告、四份季度通訊及定期更新的月度統計通訊，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新資料及主題分析。此外，香港金融管理局亦刊登了19篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的各項主題。inSight文章為香港金融管理局提供一個有用的渠道，以闡釋其重大新舉措或政策的理據，並對公眾關注的時事問題作出適時回應。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）以英語及傳統及簡體中文提供超過4萬頁的內容，並作為公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦載有經授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及AIs證券人員的紀錄冊，兩者均根據《銀行條例》第20條維持；同時亦載有儲值支付工具（SVF）牌照持有人的紀錄冊，根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》設立。香港金融管理局官方網站進行了一次重大重整，並於9月以全新設計版面、豐富內容、加強的導覽結構及更方便的搜尋功能重新啟動。重整後的網站讓用戶能根據個人喜好更輕鬆及方便地搜尋資訊。特別是，重整後的網站設有「智能消費者」新專區，公眾可在此找到有關廣泛銀行及相關產品或服務的有用資訊及智能提示。這與香港金融管理局一向推動「智能及負責任」使用銀行服務的努力一致。\n\n香港金融管理局推出全新改版的網站。\n\n重組後的香港金融管理局網站新增了一個名為「智能消費者」的專區。\n\n香港金融管理局自2018年起透過開放應用程式程式設計介面（開放API）分階段開放財務數據及網站上刊登的重要資訊。至2019年，香港金融管理局已按原定計劃在該局網站上開立130組開放API。香港金融管理局積極支持開放API的發展與應用。\n\n# 香港金融管理局資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心設於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向公眾介紹香港金融管理局工作的重要資源，並推動社會對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。資訊中心設有展覽區及圖書館，並於週一至週六開放。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況，亦提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品供公眾研究。\n\n香港金融管理局於本年完成了資訊中心最後一階段的翻新工程——歷史時間軸。這項翻新後的歷史時間軸以多媒體及數位顯示板為特色，讓訪問學者能以更互動的方式檢討香港及世界各地的重大貨幣及金融事件，並於10月重新開幕。\n\n歷史時間軸的首個部分由一個多媒體顯示面板組成，介紹1842年至1993年間的重大事件。\n\n歷史時間軸的第二部分是數位顯示面板，介紹1993年香港金融管理局設立以來的重大事件，直至現在。\n\n資訊中心為訪問學者提供導賞服務。在該年度，資訊中心接獲逾48,000名訪問學者，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過480次導賞服務（圖3）。自2003年12月資訊中心開立以來，已有逾753,000名市民到訪資訊中心。\n\n資訊中心為學校及其他團體訪問學者舉辦導賞服務。\n\n圖書館毗鄰展覽區，內藏超過26,000冊有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務及中央銀行主題的書籍、期刊及其他研究報告。圖書館亦依銀行條例第20條的規定，保持AIs及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及AIs證券人員的紀錄冊。\n\n# 公眾與消費者教育\n\n為接觸社區並提高公眾對香港金融管理局工作的認識，香港金融管理局於2019年舉辦了一場公開教育研討會，邀請超過400名中學學生及教師參與。研討會內容包括介紹香港金融管理局的工作、香港紙幣、轉數快、儲值支付工具、金融科技及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃推出以來，已有超過60,000名教師及學生參與此計劃。\n\n不同區的中學學生及教師參加2019年公共教育研討會。\n\n本年度香港金融管理局的消費者教育工作重點是教育公眾如何保護其「個人數碼鑰匙」，此概念是為幫助公眾形象化理解保障資訊以使用網上帳戶的重要性。核心信息是，在數碼世界中，網上銀行及其他數碼金融服務的帳戶登入資料及個人資料，與家門的鑰匙一樣重要，應妥善保護。為強調如何保護個人數碼鑰匙的智慧提示，香港金融管理局在不同媒體上進行廣泛推廣，包括電視、廣播、移動應用程式、社交媒體及其他數碼及戶外平台。\n\n個人數位鑰匙旗艦活動是透過廣泛的跨媒體推廣進行的。\n\n持續推動教育公眾成為聰明及負責任的金融消費者。例如，呼籲公眾保持警覺，以防假冒來自銀行的詐欺電話，以及社交媒體上宣傳的投資詐騙。處理個人信貸產品時，亦特別提醒民眾注意，尤其在納稅季節期間所採納的個人貸款。\n\n為提升中學生的財務知識水平，香港金融管理局與各項相關持份者共同舉辦「香港通識教育財務知識大賽」，這是第五年舉行。今年大賽首次運用資訊圖表，幫助學生更好地了解複雜的財務概念。大賽進行網上測驗，吸引逾10,450份報名，並最終進入在香港金融管理局舉行的決賽，這是首次於HKMA舉辦決賽。\n\n冠軍賽吸引逾10,000份網上報名，最終以在香港金融管理局舉行的現場比賽作結。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局展開了其跨世代推廣教育計劃的第二階段，該計劃與一所教育機構聯合舉辦。該計劃包括銀行模擬遊戲、家長研討會及培訓講師工作坊，針對幼稚園學生、其家長及教師，以及年輕成年人。其他針對年青人的教育措施包括與專業團體聯合為小學學生及家長製作漫畫故事書，以及為大專學生提供研討會。\n\n香港金融管理局會繼續支持投資者及財務教育委員會推動香港的財務素養及能力，並會與不同持份者探索進一步合作，以最大化消費者教育的影響力。\n\n跨世代接觸計劃首個階段的成就發布會，將一同推出第二階段。\n\n幼稚園學生參與銀行模擬遊戲。\n\n漫畫故事書是與專業團體聯合製作，用以向小學生及其家長傳播有關使用銀行及金融服務的智慧提示。\n\n# 我們的市民\n\n雖然香港金融管理局是政府的一部分，但其聘請的員工所享有的條款與公務員不同，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人士。香港金融管理局招募、培訓及保持一支高度專業的 workforce，以支持其政策目標，並靈活回應不斷變化的工作優先事項。\n\n2019年香港金融管理局的設立人數為1,005人。當年，香港金融管理局進行了一項跨部門的重整行動，以提升各項工作流程的效率，並重新調配現有資源以支持新舉措。由於這項嚴格的行動，2020年香港金融管理局的總人數仍保持在1,005人不變。資源已重新調配以執行以下新任務：\n\n# 銀行業與金融穩定\n- 制定並實施針對虛擬銀行的監管制度，並應對日益複雜的審慎監管標準\n- 提升對保險中介機構新監管制度的監管能力\n- 加強對銀行文化改革的持續監測，並持續監督銀行及其他相關提供信託服務的機構\n\n# 資產管理\n- 加強對發行基金投資活動進一步增長及多元化的投資及風險管理等必要支持\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心\n- 支持改革以提升香港稅制在不同金融服務領域的國際競爭力\n- 提升對交易庫數據的每日質性市場監察及分析\n\n表1說明了香港金融管理局的設立及實力。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據貨幣管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並在諮詢治理小組（GSC）的意見後，透過發行基金顧問委員會（EFAC）作出決定，並考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及職業退休金計劃，福利方面則以基本福利為主。現金薪酬包包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，該浮動薪酬可能每年一次以現金形式頒發給個別員工，視乎其表現而定。\n\n香港金融管理局員工薪酬每年由金融事務委員會透過eFAC向其提出的建議檢視，並考慮香港金融管理局在前一年的表現評估、由獨立人力資源顧問進行的金融行業薪酬調查的發現，以及任何其他相關因素。有需要時，可不時作出特別薪酬調整，以獎勵表現優異的個別員工，並維持其薪酬的競爭力。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to

企業社會責任\n\n香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，並旨在成為一個負責任及可持續發展的機構。此承諾體現在各項範疇，包括推動可持續及環境友善的市場，支持更廣的社區，保護環境及培育友善的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色與永續銀行\n\n氣候變遷是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續發展的重大風險。銀行業作為社會的重要組成部分，其運作亦會受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。香港金融管理局致力於探討應對此挑戰的方法。基於此背景，香港金融管理局於5月公布了一系列推動香港綠色金融發展的措施，包括採用三個階段的方法推動綠色及可持續銀行業。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n作為交易所基金的投資管理人，香港金融管理局認為，負責任投資（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於香港金融管理局是全球最大的資產所有者之一，因此其對基金經理選擇資產的方式將產生重大影響。\n\n# 我們的理念\n\n香港金融管理局視RI為一種投資方法，該方法考慮各項環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素對長線投資回報及其可持續性的影响。香港金融管理局認為，透過適當強調RI及可持續長線經濟表現，可更好地取得交易所基金的投資目標，並減少與其基礎投資相關的ESG因素所帶來的風險。\n\n# 我們的原則\n\n香港金融管理局的指導原則是，若長線風險調整後回報與其他投資相若，則通常會優先考慮環境、社會及管治投資。鑒於適當情況，香港金融管理局在其投資過程中會採納以下與其作為負責任長線投資者理念相一致的永續投資原則：\n\n# 整合\n\n香港金融管理局將環境、社會及管治因素納入其投資分析程序，以物色風險與機遇，因其相信這些因素會對其投資的長線價值產生重大影響。具體而言，香港金融管理局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入其對公眾市場及私人市場投資的投資程序。對於公眾市場投資，香港金融管理局在債券投資的信用風險分析中納入環境、社會及管治因素。與香港金融管理局持相同理念的外部管理人會被物色及委任。香港金融管理局會向所有外部管理人傳達其投資理念，並預期他們以一種能達成整體可持續長線經濟表現目標的方式配合。對於私人市場投資，香港金融管理局會在盡職調查程序中檢視其一般合伙人所採用的環境、社會及管治政策與實踐。\n\n# 活躍股權\n\n香港金融管理局在持有公眾股權時，以一種有助保障其投資長期價值的方式行使股東權利。香港金融管理局相信，以環境、社會及管治因素為指引的負責任企業行為，將有助於長線創造股東價值。香港金融管理局的資產管理人應協助香港金融管理局履行其在相關投資中的股東責任，透過行使投票權及聘用有關企業，採納積極股權方式。\n\n# 合作\n\n香港金融管理局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構攜手，推動投資長線管理的良好實踐。其參與並在公開活動中發言，以分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用ESG。\n\n請參閱「儲備管理」一章，以了解香港金融管理局在本年就RI所進行的工作細則。\n\n# 推動金融包容性\n\n香港金融管理局非常重視金融包容性，一直致力於推動不同社會群體獲得基本銀行服務，以滿足大眾的日常基本需要及合規企業的運作需要。特別是，香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，推動以下優先考慮的範疇：\n\n鼓勵銀行推出更多體格銀行設施，並制定數位及創新渠道，以提供基本銀行服務，服務廣大公眾，特別是遠距離地區及公共屋邨的居民及長者；\n\n促進及監察個人及中小企開立銀行帳戶的可及性；\n\n提升銀行服務對特定客戶群體的可近性，例如殘障人士及少數民族客戶；\n\n促進及監察中小企獲得銀行信貸的可得性；及\n\n授予八家虛擬銀行授權，這些虛擬銀行將在提供銀行服務的過程中積極推動金融包容性。\n\n# 社群\n\n# 推動財務素養\n\n香港金融管理局透過多種渠道推動金融知識。除了運作教育計劃，以推動公眾智慧及負責任地使用銀行及金融服務外，香港金融管理局亦在其重組後的官方網站上設有專門的「智慧消費者」新專區，讓公眾可找到有關銀行及相關產品和服務的廣泛有用資訊及智慧提示。此外，亦透過Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram及Twitter等社交媒體平台，以及香港金融管理局官方網站及研究報告，提供最新銀行及金融事務資訊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心自2003年起，作為香港金融管理局的重大公眾教育及研究資源，向社區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。資訊中心每日為來自學校及非營利機構的團體訪問學者提供導賞服務。此外，亦為學生舉辦公眾教育研討會及其他活動，以提升他們的財務知識及素養。同時，香港金融管理局亦與投資者及財務教育委員會緊密合作，透過其財務教育平台「陳家駿財經教育基金」推動香港的財務素養。\n\n請參閱「公司功能」一章，以取得有關香港金融管理局在本年推動財務素養工作的更多細則。請參閱「銀行穩定」一章，以取得有關香港金融管理局在本年推動財務包容性的更多細則。\n\n# 應對特殊群體的需要\n\n# 香港紙幣的可接觸性\n\n2018年紙幣系列保留了上一系列紙幣中運用的輔助特點，以幫助視障人士區分不同面額。這些輔助特點包括點字、觸覺線條及高觸感數字。\n\n為幫助視障人士分辨紙幣的面額，由香港金融管理局贊助、香港視障人士社會服務協會開發的移動應用程式，會使用手機相機掃描紙幣圖案以辨識面額。此應用程式可於Apple App Store及Google Play Store免費下載。香港金融管理局與三間發行紙幣的銀行亦聯合贊助發行了一款測量紙幣長度的附註測量模板。該模板可測量2018系列紙幣及現時流通的紙幣。模板一邊鑄有點字，另一邊則有圖案。該模板免費發放予服務視障人士的機構。\n\n# 硬幣收藏計劃\n\n根據硬幣收集計劃，香港金融管理局與香港社會服務聯會合作，採取硬幣推車於志願日為非政府機構收集硬幣。\n\n# 公共資訊的可近性\n\n重組後的香港金融管理局官方網站於9月推出。重組後的網站加強了導覽結構，以促進用戶根據個人喜好進行容易及方便的搜尋。特別地，網站在「智慧消費者」部分設有專門專頁「其他語言資訊」，提供以少數族裔社區常使用的七種語言撰寫的銀行服務資訊，包括印尼語、印地語、尼泊爾語、旁遮普語、他加祿語、泰語及烏爾都語。\n\n香港金融管理局致力確保其網站盡可能符合萬維網聯盟 (W3C) 的萬維網內容可訪問性指南 (WCAG) 2.0 級別 AA 標準，以促進有特殊需要的市民網上資訊的無障礙接觸。\n\n# 志願與慈善活動\n\n香港金融管理局透過參與志願及慈善活動支持社區服務。高級長者家居安全協會因參與2018年「愛與安心」企業參與計劃，頒發社區參與晶鑽獎予香港金融管理局。\n\n香港金融管理局志願團隊2019年參與的慈善活動\n\n「Yo！一起走這條路」由年青人外展部製作。\n\n藝術家及來自「香港殘障藝術協會」的代表到訪香港藝術博物館辦事處，該協會的藝術作品於此展出。\n\nHKMA 會員積極參與血漿捐贈日、全港升旗日、社區基金會綠日、愛牙日、跳過午飯日、穿著休閒日及定期舉辦的衣物、玩具及其他可重用物品收集活動，以捐贈給慈善團體。\n\nHKMA 會員積極參與香港紅十字會舉辦的捐血日活動。\n\n# 友善機構\n\n為表彰其對社區照顧的承諾，香港金融管理局連續第13年獲香港社會服務聯會頒發「10年加友善機構標誌」認證。\n\n# 環境\n\n# 節能辦公室措施\n\n香港金融管理局已設立環境政策，以保護及保本環境。該政策及落實措施定期向其員工當中公布。綠色辦公室措施包括：\n\n# 紙張\/影印\/列印\n\n- 鼓勵使用再生紙張及信封；\n- 以電子副本取代文件的實體副本；\n- 在紙張兩面印製；\n- 僅在必要時使用彩色印製及複印；\n- 避免使用紙杯；以及\n- 以環保紙張及油墨印製香港金融管理局年報。\n\n# 耗電量\n\n- 使用完電腦、印表機、燈光、音視訊系統及其他電動設備後，關掉這些設備。在超出預設運作時間後，重新啟動大多數設備（如飲水機、電動打孔機及碎紙機）內預設的節電模式；  \n- 定期審視在正常營業時間外是否需要額外的空調。\n\n# 回收\n\n善用回收箱來收集不同類別的廢物，包括紙張、罐頭、瓶子、電池、CD與墨盒。\n\n# 工作環境\n\n# 多樣性與包容性\n\n# 平等機遇政策\n\n香港金融管理局是平等機會僱主。它相信每個人應能在無歧視、騷擾、貶損及報復的環境中工作。平等機會政策適用於職位招聘廣告、招聘程序、僱傭條款及條件、工作表現評估、晉升、調職、培訓、解僱、投訴程序及一般行為準則。\n\n# 有關多元化的關鍵統計數據\n\n市民是香港金融管理局工作的核心。我們重視員工的多元性，現有員工的性別比例平衡，且年齡層亦涵蓋不同範圍。\n\n高級管理層，即執行總裁及以上層級的女性佔比為31%，截至2020年2月。\n\n# 2020年1月1日人力資本關鍵統計數據\n\n# 良好工作環境\n\n為應付預期的運作需要，香港金融管理局於本年翻新辦公室，以創造開放式布局、增加容量，並讓空間使用更高效。休息區及符合人體工學的家具是新辦公室設計的一部分。為提升員工的體格健康，管理局為員工提供可調高度的書桌，讓他們在一天中容易地在坐與站之間改變姿勢。\n\n可調高度的辦公桌可改善辦公室人體工學。\n\n# 員工福祉\n\n香港金融管理局推動工作與生活平衡，關心員工的健康及工作安全。定期舉辦有關健康生活方式、壓力管理及工作環境安全的研討會，並監察室內空氣質素。每年安排員工進行現場體檢及流感疫苗接種。香港金融管理局亦贊助一個由經驗豐富的心理學家及社會工作者組成的專業諮詢服務。\n\n全年舉辦不同活動，以提升員工的體格健康，促進其歸屬感，並促進合作及團隊精神。為員工及其家屬舉辦興趣班。與其他機構及跨部門的活動，如與同業監管機構進行的籃球及足球比賽，亦為員工提供社交機會。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

觀點\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，載於第187至293頁，包括交易所基金及集團於2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該會計年度的收入支出賬目、綜合收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括重大會計政策概要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公平地反映截至2019年12月31日基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該財務年度內其財務表現及現金流，並根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並已根據《發行基金條例》（Cap. 66）第7條所賦予總督的指令作出適當編製。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據《發鈔兌換基金條例》第7條所頒佈的行政長官批示及審計委員會的審計準則進行了審計。根據這些準則，我的責任已在我的報告中「審計財務報表的會計師責任」部分進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立性，並已根據這些準則履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 重要審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為在我專業判斷下，於審計2019年12月31日結賬年度財務報表時具有最重大意義的事項。這些事項是在審計財務報表整體的過程中處理的，並在形成我的意見時考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債的公允價值計量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為HK$3,874,223百萬，金融負債總額為HK$1,158,686百萬，按公允價值計價。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 91% 以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值均以活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1 輸入）為依據，或利用估值技術，以可觀察市場數據為基礎進行估算（Level 2 輸入）。\n\n對於這些金融資產中餘下的9%，其公允價值是根據未基於可觀察市場數據（第三層輸入）的估值技術進行估算。這些金融資產總計為338,758百萬港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於涉及的金額及估計數額相當重大，以公允價值計價金融資產及金融負債為一重大審計事項。\n\n有關金融資產及以公允價值計量的金融負債評估的審計程序包括：\n\n取得對評價不同類別金融資產及金融負債所涉及程序（包括相關控制）的了解；\n\n評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統相關的應用控制措施；\n\n取得有關財務資產及財務負債之評價、存在、權利與義務及完整性之外部確認；\n\n引用市價時，驗證價格是否來自獨立來源；\n\n- 係根據可觀察市場數據所運用之估值技術，評估估值方法之適合性及假設之合理性，並核實輸入數據來源是否獨立；及\n\n- 係運用非根據可觀察市場數據之估值技術時，評估估值方法之適合性及假設與輸入數據之合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產以公允價值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列示，截至2019年12月31日總值為HK$22,481百萬。集團亦持有涉及二十兩合資企業，總值為HK$44,506百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有或由合資企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。有關估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所採用的估值方法及所運用的假設。\n\n評估以公允價值計價的投資物業的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱集團直接或透過合資企業所持投資物業的估值報告，並確認公允價值是根據估值報告中列示的估值而釐定。\n\n評估評估師的獨立性及資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適合性及假設與輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港金融管理局2019年年度報告內的所有資料，除外財務報表及我的會計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未就此發表任何形式的結論。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則顯得有重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我便有責任報告此事實。就此事而言，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 當局及發鈔銀行顧問委員會審計小組就財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《發行基金條例》第7條作出的行政長官指示，準備提供真實公允視點的財務報表，並負責貨幣管理局認為為使財務報表免受重大誤導所必要之內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，當局有責任評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會負責監察集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 會計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認整體財務報表在重大錯誤或舞弊的情況下是否不存在重大不正確，並發出包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並非保證根據會計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總是能發現已存在的重大不正確。不正確可能來自舞弊或錯誤，如果單獨或合計起來，它們可被合理預期影響基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決定，則被視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計的過程中，我全程行使專業判斷並維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n物色並評估財務報表中重大誤報的風險，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致，設計並執行與這些風險相關的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能發現因訛騙導致的重大誤報的風險，高於因錯誤導致的重大誤報的風險，因為訛騙可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制的情況。\n\n用以取得與審計相關的內部控制了解，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但並非用以就集團內部控制的成效表達意見；\n\n評估當局所運用的會計政策的適合性及所作出的會計估計及其相關披露的合理性；\n\n評估貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎會計的適當性，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在重大不確定性，該不確定性與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大懷疑的事件或情況有關。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我有責任在審計報告中就財務報表中相關的披露作出關注，若相關披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我出具審計報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營的實體。\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括揭露資訊，並確認財務報表是否以適當方式錄得，能恰當地反映集團內各實體或業務活動的基礎交易及事件；並取得足夠適當的審計證據，以就財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我維持對我的審計意見獨自負責。\n\n我聯繫交易所基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會，有關當中包括審計的預計範圍及時間安排，以及重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中物色到的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦提供給發行基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會一份報告，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用情況下，提供相關保障措施。\n\n根據與發行基金顧問委員會審計小組溝通的事項，我決定本會計期間財務報表審計中最為重要的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。我在審計師報告中說明這些事項，除非法律或監管不允許公開披露有關事項，或在極少數情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果將合理地超過披露該事項所帶來的公共利益福利。\n\n朱振華\n稽核部經理\n\n審計委員會
