{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

逆境中的韌性\n\n2023年金融市場的主要主題，是來自「利率高檔長時間維持」環境下全球經濟增長放緩，以及日益升級的國際局勢緊張所產生的影響——不僅來自俄烏戰事與中美關係緊張，也來自中東地區衝突的爆發。美國與歐洲3月份發生的銀行危機，是自2008年全球金融危機以來最嚴重的系統性銀行危機，進一步壓抑市場氣氛。主要經濟體面臨貨幣狀況趨緊的嚴峻現實，以及對通脹走勢與利率前景的更大不確定性。此外，中國內地經濟復甦的速度慢於市場普遍預期，也增加了不確定性。\n\n在金融市場的波動與不可預測性成為「新常態」的背景下，香港再次展現了其著名的適應能力，表現出驚人的韌性。自去年香港全面恢復疫情後的正常運作以來，已進行大量工作以吸引人們重返我們這個動態的城市，並重新與香港建立聯繫。金管局透過舉辦一系列大型國際活動，例如國際金融領袖投資峰會以及與國際結算銀行（BIS）舉行的會議，展示我們活躍的城市形象，並向全球發出訊號，說明香港作為一個重要的國際金融中心（IFC），持續開放、積極行動並推動創新。目前已有明顯跡象顯示復甦逐步展開，這是由入境旅遊業的鼓舞人心的復甦以及私人消費的改善所驅動，同時也受到強韌的勞工市場以及政府推出各種支援措施的支持。整體而言，香港在2023年的本地生產總值增長從2022年的負增長回升至3.2%。\n\n金管局於2023年邁入其第四個十年。過去三十年間，經濟與金融市場的動態已發生劇烈變化，科技推動的進步遠超任何人最狂野的想像。過去三十年累積的寶貴經驗與智慧，使我們能以信心面對未來。儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及不確定的國際環境，金管局將繼續履行其在香港維護貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職責，並積極尋求發展機會，鞏固這份穩定，並鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。\n\n香港特別行政區政府財政司司長及香港金融管理局總裁在慶祝金管局成立30週年的聚會上：（由左至右）任志剛先生、唐英年先生、曾蔭權先生、陳茂波先生、余偉文先生、梁錦松先生、曾俊華先生及陳德霖先生\n\n# 聯匯制度 — 度過風暴\n\n去年是聯匯制度（LERS）實施40週年，該制度一直是支撐香港強大而穩定的貨幣及金融體系的堅實支柱。四十年來，聯匯制度以透明而有效的運作，培養了市場對該制度的信心及其聲譽。全年內，港元維持在兌換保證區內，港元市場運作暢順，反映市場對聯匯制度的強大信心，這種信心亦獲國際貨幣基金組織及全球市場參與者所共享及表達。\n\n此信心背後，有金管局積極參與公眾及市場交流，以及有效的監察工作。我們在過去一年內不遺餘力地與關鍵持份者溝通，以促進對聯匯制度運作機制的清晰理解，尤其在市場波動時期，這種理解尤為重要，無論波動源於經濟壓力或政治不確定性。我們亦加強對貨幣體制的監察，善用來自交易資料儲存庫的數據集，並擴展來自銀行的微數據，同時運用先進的數據分析法及人工智能，以提升我們的能力，使我們能更及時、全面地分析金融穩定及宏觀審慎監察情況。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 穩定的重要來源\n\n儘管面對包括高利率環境、持續的國際政治緊張關係及嚴峻的信貸環境等多重挑戰，香港的銀行體系全年仍保持穩定，這得益於強勁的資本及流動性緩衝。\n\n截至2023年底，本地銀行的合併總資本比率為21.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。截至2023年第四季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率上升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的100%。雖然特定分類貸款比率從2022年底的1.40%微升至2023年底的1.56%，但仍低於長期平均水平的2.0%。此增幅主要由對內地民營房地產開發商的 exposures 所推動；然而，由於銀行多年來謹慎的風險管理，相關 exposures 水平普遍受到良好控制，銀行體系的資產質素仍保持穩健。\n\n2023年最令市場參與者驚訝的事，無疑是美國銀行危機外溢至歐洲，造成自2008年全球金融危機以來前所未見的系統性銀行危機。金管局在情況發展過程中保持高度警覺，並採取多項預防性措施，以限制對本地銀行及金融體系信心的潛在負面外溢效應。加上香港銀行維持強勁的資本及流動性緩衝，使本地銀行體系 largely 不受危機影響，即使全球金融市場動蕩，亦能保持韌性。在此次事件後，金管局進行了全面的內部檢討，以汲取經驗，強化本地銀行體系，並提升金管局的監管成效及靈活性，以應對未來可能出現的銀行危機。\n\n雖然謹慎的信貸風險管理至關重要，我們一直重申對銀行支持實體經濟的監管期望。自2023年7月有序退出銀行體系的預先批核還息不還本計劃開始，隨著新型冠狀病毒疫情的經濟影響漸漸減退，金管局與銀行緊密合作，確保貸款償還逐步轉向正常模式，並為那些仍面臨壓力的借款人提供靈活性。今年早些時候，鑒於一些中小企即使在疫情結束後仍面臨營運挑戰，金管局推出了九項新措施，進一步協助這些企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n在審視銀行物業貸款業務所涉及的本地物業市場風險後，金管局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來首次放寬對住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。此次放寬措施提高了大多數住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展與投資融資的按揭成數上限。其後，於2024年初進一步暫停了利率壓力測試的監管要求。\n\n金管局對金融機構的監管一直跟隨時代步伐。近年全球詐騙案件急劇增加，我們已大幅加強努力，以應對新型詐騙手法，並推行一套全面措施，以保護銀行客戶。這些措施包括加強銀行與執法機構之間的信息分享；加強對可疑交易的監測（包括實施即時詐騙監測及加強支付卡認證）；賦予客戶對支付卡有更多控制權；以及透過推行《保障消費者防詐騙約章》及啟動可疑識別代號警示機制，提高客戶及公眾對詐騙的認識。該機制會在發現高風險「轉數快」（FPS）交易時提醒用戶。\n\n鑑於創新及數碼銀行產品和服務的不斷增加，金管局已與銀行業界合作，進一步加強消費者及投資者保障，提升銀行的運作及網絡韌性，以及他們對系統性網絡事件的集體防禦能力。同時，所有主要銀行亦大幅加強了應對及從破壞性勒索軟件攻擊中復原的能力。金管局與業界亦推行多項個人資料基建項目，例如「信資通」試點計劃，以加強個人信貸資料服務，並推進跨境信貸資料互通項目，以促進企業的跨境融資活動。\n\n金融科技與數位化在風險妥善管理的情況下，可帶來巨大的發展機會。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局的支持下，參考以往促進合規科技（Regtech）應用的成功經驗，於2023年8月發表了新的金融科技推廣計劃，以推動金融機構在財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式賬本技術五大重點領域進一步發展金融科技。我們預期本地監管機構在未來幾年持續協作，與相關行業緊密合作，使香港金融業整體能跟上動態發展的金融科技，並享其帶來的效益。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心 — 行動與創新的核心\n\n2023年，我們已完全走出疫情陰霾。香港不僅恢復了經濟活動，其作為世界主要國際金融中心之一的地位，亦因全球投資者的回流及我們全球網絡的強化而更加鞏固。在香港本地，我們把握香港金融管理局成立30週年的契機，舉辦一系列大型國際活動，吸引來自全球金融與銀行界的高層參與，以展現香港的活力，並清楚傳達香港作為國際金融中心對全球投資者及尋求增長與創新之金融機構而言，依然具備重要性與不可替代性。特別值得一提的是，11月舉行的國際金融領袖投資峰會重啟，吸引來自約160間全球金融機構的逾350位國際及地區領袖來港參與。在香港舉辦的其他高層級活動包括巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）會議，以及兩場由金管局與國際結算銀行合辦的會議，這些會議是當年規模最大的央行行長及銀行業監管機構聚會。這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n從國際視野來看，2023年也是香港積極拓展與傳統市場，包括美國和歐洲，以及新興目的地如中東等地的聯繫的一年。我們與這些市場的相關監管機構及全球金融機構的高層管理人員會面，向他們介紹及更新香港與內地的發展機遇，同時尋找香港的新合作機會。\n\n為配合這些參與工作，我們積極參與國際及區域論壇的相關工作，並擔任一些領導角色。今年，我接受了擔任國際結算銀行（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體行長會議主席的邀請，並與他人共同擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組的主席。我的同事們也正擔任或與他人共同擔任巴塞爾委員會、財務行動特別組織及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議等其他重要小組的主席或共同主席。金管局在許多區域及國際論壇中擔任領導角色，這反映了香港在國際中央銀行及監管工作方面所具有的專業知識與貢獻，有助於實現全球貨幣與金融穩定，同時也凸顯了香港作為國際金融中心（IFC）的重要性。\n\n基於上述成就，我們必須將自己定位為一個具前瞻性國際金融中心，保持領先優勢，以確保我們持續的競爭力。我們已識別出未來幾年將塑造我們未來的三大長期趨勢：即內地持續開放、綠色和可持續金融的發展以及金融科技的應用。我們將繼續支持金融市場的發展，以把握這些長期趨勢帶來的機遇，同時將我們的金融平台定位為提供領先服務，以吸引更多企業來香港。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，讀者可參閱我們的二零二三年可持續發展報告。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce,

經濟及金融環境\n\n儘管面對嚴峻的外部環境，香港經濟在2023年仍實現正面增長，主要得益於入境旅遊業及本地需求的復甦。經濟復甦同時推動勞工市場持續改善，而通脹則保持溫和。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，不過前景因多項外部不確定性而蒙上陰影。\n\n香港的銀行體系在2023年仍保持穩健，得益於強勁的資本及流動性緩衝。資產質素仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n面對市場對「高利率維持較久」的美國政策利率預期，2023年港元主要在兌換區的弱方兌換保證範圍內交易，其中從2月中旬至5月初，弱方兌換保證被觸發了八次。港元外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，並繼續以順暢有序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年是聯繫匯率制度實施40週年。作為香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度在過去四十年間幫助香港應對一系列衝擊和危機，展現了該制度的韌性和強大性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n金管局迅速回應3月份在美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機，從處理傳遞效應到完成內部檢討，汲取經驗以加強本地銀行體系，同時持續關注銀行的信用、流動性及市場風險管理。面對不斷升級的網絡威脅及第三方提供的科技服務使用量增加，金管局亦與銀行緊密合作，提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n金管局加強對支付卡的消費者保障，並透過進一步修訂銀行營運守則及保障消費者防詐騙約章。金管局與其他監管機構合作，建立針對虛擬資產相關活動的平衡監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售程序，為「跨境理財通」業務試點引入改進措施，並開始監管信託業務。同時，亦啟動了「信資通」下的個人信貸資料服務試點計劃。\n\n金管局在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的努力，體現了以風險為基礎的方法，針對最高威脅作出承諾。為應對日益增加的數碼騙案，金管局已透過啟動實時詐騙監測、加強銀行與執法機構之間的信息分享、加強公眾教育宣傳，以及在使用轉數快系統時啟動新的可疑識別代號警示機制，來加強生態圈各持份者的合作。同時，亦透過傀儡戶口網絡分析先導計劃推進監管科技能力。\n\n金管局在本地落實國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足及披露標準，並在加強銀行體系專業能力方面作出顯著努力。\n\n金管局亦積極推進工作，以確保可信的處置機制，包括制定有關接觸關鍵金融市場基建的新處置標準，以及完成有關吸收虧損能力政策標準實施情況的審視。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第二屆國際金融領袖投資峰會及香港金融管理局–國際結算銀行高級別會議圓滿結束，展現了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n金管局與內地及香港的相關機構緊密合作，以深化和擴闊香港與內地金融市場之間的互聯互通。這包括對跨境理財通方案的改進、為債券通「南向通」指定更多做市商、成功啟動北向互換通交易，以及推行港元人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台莊家機制，這些措施均有助鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面，債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融以及企業財資中心等領域已取得顯著進展。\n\n金管局持續在「金融科技2025」策略的不同方面取得重大進展。mBridge項目已進入最簡可行產品開發階段，數碼港元項目第一階段已完成，商業數據通的使用情況不斷上升，並成功與政府數據源連結。此外，亦公布了一項新的金融科技推廣計劃，以進一步發展財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及銀行體系的分布式賬本技術。同時，轉數快系統迎來第五週年，持續擴大應用範圍並進行升級，包括新增功能如與泰國PromptPay連結以實現跨境二維碼支付。在建立穩定幣發行人監管制度方面亦取得重大進展，已發佈公眾諮詢文件以收集對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n儘管投資環境波動且充滿挑戰，外匯基金仍成功取得港幣2260億元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.5%。\n\n金管局持續推動資產多元化及負責任投資。同時，長期增長組合自2009年成立以來，年率化內部回報率達11.8%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社區及市場保持積極溝通，以推進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\ninternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and initiatives."}

7月24日\n\n金管局將外匯基金票據及債券的配發時間由上午11時30分延長至下午4時，縮短同日配發及贖回的時間間隔，以提高銀行同業市場的效率。\n\n# 銀行業\n\n# 2 月 9 日\n\n金管局更新《交易監察、篩查和可疑交易舉報指引文件》，以支援認可機構為提高這些控制範疇的成效和效率而作出的變更，並支援更廣泛運用科技以產生具針對性的提示。\n\n# 2月22日\n\n中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）的80%擔保產品、90%擔保產品及特別100%貸款擔保的申請期已延長至2024年3月底。\n\n# 22-23 月\n\n金管局主辦巴塞爾銀行監管委員會兩日會議。這是自2020年疫情爆發以來，該委員會首次在巴塞爾總部以外舉行的實體會議，旨在討論最新的銀行業監管政策，以協助維持全球金融穩定。\n\n# 3月24日\n\n金管局與國際結算銀行（BIS）

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

2024年及以後的重點方向\n\n邁入2024年，香港經濟預期將繼續以溫和步伐復甦，受益於持續復甦的入境旅遊業、公共基建項目及穩定的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不確定性，尤其是與未來美國政策利率走勢、全球增長前景及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢相關的風險。不過，香港的金融體系由於多年來累積的韌性及充足緩衝，仍具備應對不利衝擊的能力。\n\n金管局非常重視維護香港的貨幣與金融穩定。展望未來，我們將在不確定的宏觀經濟環境中保持警覺，及時識別新興風險並靈活應對。同時，我們亦會尋找機會，創造政策空間，以進一步提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在這困難的投資環境下管理外匯基金時，我們會繼續謹慎投資，同時保持靈活性，適時採取防禦性部署，並維持高度流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與健全\n\n近年來的全球經濟不確定性預計將在2024年持續。金管局將密切關注最新發展，並保持警覺以應對潛在風險，以維持金融體系的韌性和穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警覺以應對潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景的不確定性、不斷演變的國際政治風險以及不均勻的全球經濟復甦而出現波動。2024年也是重要選舉年，許多主要選舉將在全球範圍內舉行。這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，香港的金融體系因其多年來建立的韌性和緩衝能力，應能有效抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦具備能力、資源和承諾，以維護香港的貨幣與金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續努力密切監察國內及國際環境中出現的任何風險和弱點，并在必要時採取適當措施以維持香港的貨幣與金融穩定。我們亦會進行研究，探討影響香港經濟的問題，評估并處理與這些問題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行穩定\n\n2023年，世界各地出現新的地緣政治緊張局勢，而一些舊有問題仍未解決，導致政治不確定性和不穩定性，預料將持續至2024年。高利率所帶來的經濟壓力成為全球形勢的特徵，進入2024年，利率仍處於高位。在銀行業內，持續推動數位化以及實施新技術，包括人工智能，為業界帶來許多優勢，同時也帶來新的運營及網絡安全風險，以及監管挑戰。在這樣一個政治、經濟和科技皆充滿不確定性的環境下，金管局致力於透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行能承受衝擊。同時，我們亦會繼續完善和優化銀行監管及政策框架，考慮科技發展、客戶期望的變化，以及國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於日益嚴峻的宏觀經濟環境，金管局將特別關注監察認可機構（AIs）的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理及控制措施的有效性，特別是在貸款分類、撥備及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦會與銀行及商業界保持緊密溝通，以確保認可機構能在經濟週期中，在進行謹慎信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡。特別是，我們會透過銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，跟進2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企從銀行取得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不確定性以及升高的地緣政治緊張局勢，可能會增加資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性。金管局將把謹慎作為首要任務，並會繼續有效地監督認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 從2023年銀行危機所汲取教訓的後續行動\n\n金管局將落實其在回應2023年美國和歐洲銀行危機所進行的內部檢討中識別出的後續行動。這些行動將進一步強化監管成效，並提升其應對銀行危機的能力。這些行動包括在金管局監管審查程序的背景下，加強認可機構對銀行帳內利率風險的風險掌握，因銀行服務持續數位化而提升認可機構應對流動性受壓情況的準備情況，簡化金管局的危機管理流程，以及進一步加強與其他監管機構之間和跨境的監管協調。\n\n# 操作與科技風險\n\n金管局將繼續監察認可機構在達成完全符合金管局監管政策手冊（SPM）模組 OR-2「運作穩健性」方面所取得的進展，並評估及比較銀行對合理干擾的容忍度，以提升銀行體系整體的穩健性。有關網絡風險方面，我們將監督認可機構根據網絡防衛評估框架2.0進行新的自我評估，並監察認可機構實施安全的三重數據備份，以提升其面對破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n考慮到銀行業務數碼化步伐不斷加快，金管局將密切關注使用先進技術（如生成式人工智能及分布式賬本技術）所產生的 emerging 風險。我們亦會與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，運作一個靈活且預防性的機制，以應對數碼騙案日益增長的趨勢。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n2024年，為維護銀行體系的完整性並建立客戶信心，金管局將針對高風險領域，優先推行以風險為基礎的監管更新，包括發出指引，以支持對政治人物的監管要求變更的風險為基礎的有效落實，以及支持穩定幣發行人監管制度的實施。我們亦會發出指引，協助認可機構優化其交易監測系統，並促進人工智能的負責任使用，並透過主題性工作針對高層次洗錢活動加強控制措施。為加強對數碼騙案的生態系統應對，並減少對受害者的損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾及業界，就擴展銀行間資訊共享範疇，從企業戶口擴展至個人戶口的建議進行諮詢，並根據所接獲的意見，推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過整合多家銀行與反洗錢相關的數據，並與現有生態系統的詐騙分析系統接駁，實現宏觀分析3.0的全面建設。這將帶來更快的跨銀行應對措施，進一步提升我們以數據為基礎的反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子資金籌集監管，使我們能更快、更有效地應對系統性洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2024年，金管局將加強對認可機構在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品及保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務方面的行為進行現場審查及非現場監察。更為具體而言，我們將重點關注跨境理財通（跨境理財通）業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期人壽保險產品及保費融資業務，並考慮最新市場發展及不斷演進的國際標準。\n\n金管局將與其他監管機構及銀行業密切溝通，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售提供適當的監管標準指引。特別是為支持壽險行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保現行針對壽險行業的監管制度具備強健、全面及平衡的特質。\n\n金管局將協助並監察業界落實跨境理財通的改進措施，並繼續與業界及相關監管機構協調，以進一步完善該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售程序，並適時統一及澄清指引，以促進業界遵守規則。除了信託業務外，我們亦會開始根據《證券及期貨條例》監管認可機構就證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）授權的集體投資計劃所提供的保管服務所涉及的第13類受規管活動，有關監管安排將於2024年10月2日開始實施。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局旨在根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例（PSSVFO）、金融市場基建的原則（PFMI）及支付及金融基建委員會（CPMI）所發出的各項指引，促進其監管範疇內金融市場基建（FMIs）的安全與效率。我們會繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI的實施監測及評估工作，並參與其他國際工作小組，討論新穎及創新金融市場基建相關措施的實施情況。我們亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並適時檢視及強化我們的監管要求，以反映最新的國際實踐及市場與科技發展情況。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將繼續加強和完善其銀行監管及政策框架，並考慮國際標準及最佳實踐。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n擬議對《銀行業（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行業（披露）規則》（BDR）的修訂，以落實《巴塞爾協定三最終改革方案》（最終方案），預計在修訂規則獲立法會通過後，於2025年1月1日生效。2024年，金管局將繼續準備支持指引、銀行業申報表及標準披露模板和表格，以協助規則的實施。特別是，我們計劃：\n- 在2024年第二季就「逆周期緩衝資本（CCyB）–私人部門信貸風險地理分配」的監管政策手冊單元CA-B-3的修訂，以及申報表MA(BS)25「關於逆周期緩衝資本的季度報告」進行諮詢，反映因實施最終方案及修訂國際銀行業務統計資料申報表而產生的後續變更；及\n- 完成有關市場及信貸價值調整風險新標準的僅報告要求的方案，該要求自2024年7月1日起生效。\n\n有關擬議修訂《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》（BELR）及《銀行業（流動性）規則》（BLR）的條文，若該等條文主要因應實施經修訂的《資本規則》（BCR）下的最終方案而作出，亦預計於2025年1月1日生效。金管局預計於2024年完成相關監管報表的擬議後果性修訂。\n\n同時，巴塞爾銀行監管委員會於2022年12月及2023年12月分別發佈了有關銀行加密資產風險承擔的新的審慎處理標準及隨後針對性的標準修訂，當地預計於2025年實施該標準。金管局將檢視是否有需要對多套規則進行潛在的立法修訂，包括資本規則、披露規則、風險承擔限度規則及流動性規則，並於2025年上半年進行相關規則修訂的法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n金管局計劃根據2023年3月美國和歐洲銀行危機所帶來的經驗教訓，以及監管要求和國際標準的發展情況，更新若干監管政策手冊模組。這些模組包括：\n"}
{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90% Guarantee Product":["九成信貸擔保產品"],"$mart Money Management

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90%

建立一套明確的機構管治架構，具備高度的問責性；\n- 采取強而有力的控制措施，以管理風險並確保各層級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；以及\n- 建立高透明度及可接觸性的政策，並與持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府的一部分，但為吸引具合適經驗及專業知識的人員，可按與公務員不同的條件僱用員工。金管局總裁及其員工屬公職人員。在日常運作中，金管局在賦予或委派予金融管理專員的相關法定權力範圍內，享有高度自主權。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制的結構：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件指明，這些目標應以貨幣穩定為準，即維持約1美元兌港幣7.80元的穩定兌換價值，並由貨幣發行局制度來實現。金融管理專員須獨立負責實現貨幣政策目標，包括決定實現該目標的策略、工具及執行方式。金融管理專員亦有責任維護香港貨幣體制的穩定及完整性。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長協助下，負責制定政策以維持香港金融體系的穩定及完整性，以及香港作為國際金融中心的地位。為支持這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 推動銀行體系的總體穩定及有效運作；\n- 與其他相關機構合作，促進債務市場的發展；\n- 與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，並在適當情況下運作這些系統，促進金融基建的安全及效率；以及\n- 與其他相關機構合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行發展市場措施，以加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長負責管理。根據財政司司長的委任，金融管理專員須向財政司司長負責，並就外匯基金的使用及基金的投資管理事宜作出報告。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n金管局在日常運作及執行政府所確定的政策目標所採用的方法上享有的自主權，並伴隨著高度的問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局透過推動貨幣與銀行體系穩定、有效管理官方儲備以及發展和監督強大而多元的金融基建，服務香港。這些過程有助加強香港作為國際金融中心的角色，並促進香港的經濟福祉。\n\n金管局必須獲得社會的信賴，才能有效地履行其職責。因此，金管局重視向公眾解釋其政策及工作，並盡一切努力處理與金管局職責相關的社區關注事項。特別是，金管局會透過傳統及社交媒體，及時澄清有關其政策的誤導性資訊及流言。\n\n金管局透過財政司司長 accountable，財政司司長會委任金融管理專員，並透過立法會通過的法律，這些法律說明了金融管理專員的職權和責任，向香港市民負責。金管局亦承認有更廣泛的責任，促進對其職能和目標的更好理解，並保持對社區關注事項的了解。在日常運作及與社區的廣泛接觸中，金管局推行透明度和可接觸性的政策。此政策有兩個主要目標：\n- 在考慮市場敏感性、商業保密性及披露機密資訊的法定限制的情況下，盡可能讓金融業和公眾充分了解金管局的工作情況；及\n- 确保金管局與其所服務的社區保持聯繫並作出回應。\n\n金管局致力於遵循國際最佳實踐，以提升其透明度安排。金管局與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫，並以英語和中文出版一系列定期及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）載有大量金管局出版物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件，另設有專門版塊，包括經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他主題。金管局亦利用社交媒體平台，在數字時代更有效地與公眾溝通。金管局於其寫字樓設有資訊中心，內設圖書館及展覽區，並於週一至週六對公眾開放。有關金管局在公共溝通及參與方面的更多資料，請參閱「機構職能」一章第185至193頁。\n\n多年來，金管局逐步增加就外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目披露資訊的詳盡程度及頻率。自1999年起，金管局參與國際貨幣基金組織的數據公布特殊標準計劃。金管局會公布外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣發行委員會會議記錄，以及貨幣發行局運作的報告。自1996年起，銀行業監管政策及指引已於金管局網站上發佈。\n\n金管局與立法會之間的關係在推動問責性及透明度方面發揮重要作用。金管局總裁已作出正式承諾，每年三次出席立法會財經事務委員會會議，向議員簡報並回答有關金管局工作的問題。金管局代表有時會出席立法會委員會及小組委員會會議，就特定議題進行解釋及討論，並協助議員審視條例草案。\n\n# 控制項\n\n金管局採用強而有力的內部及外部監控機制，以確保其維持高水平的員工行為準則、謹慎的風險管理以及適當的制衡措施。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制的充足性及有效性提供獨立評估。\n\n# 《行為守則》\n\n已制定《行為守則》，以提供員工有關道德與法律責任的指引，確保員工行為在各層級均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n所有部門及分支均有責任識別及評估其工作流程的風險，並設立適當的控制措施，以確保金管局日常運作的順暢進行。這構成風險管理的第一度防線。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在公司層面進行，由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的其中一個重要組成部分。\n\n各功能單位所識別出的潛在及新興風險，以及其制定的監控措施與緩解策略是否充足，均會報告並在風險委員會討論，該委員會並決定適當的後續行動。\n\n#

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

經濟及金融環境\n\n儘管面對嚴峻的外部環境，香港經濟在2023年仍實現了正面增長，得益於入境旅遊業及本地需求的復甦。經濟復甦期間，勞工市場持續改善，同時通脹保持溫和。在金融狀況趨緊及市場氣氛疲弱的情況下，資產市場仍偏軟。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，不過前景因多項外部不確定性而蒙上陰霾。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n經歷了前一年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟在2023年穩步增長3.2%（見表1及圖1）。就本地情況而言，私人消費在勞工市場條件改善及政府推行的各項支援措施，例如消費券計劃及一系列推廣活動的推動下，明顯恢復。儘管金融狀況趨緊，但投資支出仍以較低的基數對比上一年度，出現顯著增長。在外圍方面，香港的服務輸出因入境旅遊業強勁復甦而回升。然而，其正面影響被出境旅遊業強勁復甦所抵消，而出境旅遊業的復甦是以服務輸入的形式衡量的。另一方面，貨物出口在外部需求疲弱的情況下表現平淡，對香港本地生產總值（GDP）增長造成拖累。\n\n圖表 1 實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻情況\n來源：政府統計處\n\n表1 實質本地生產總值增長按支出組成項目（按季比較）  \n註：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節性調整的按季增減幅度數據不可用。  \n來源：政府統計處\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n2023年本地通脹維持溫和，因外在價格壓力逐漸緩和，而國內成本壓力雖略有上升，但整體仍大致受控（圖表2）1。2023年整體而言，核心通脹率與 headline 通脹率分別為1.7%與2.1%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n2023年勞工市場情況進一步改善，失業率在7月降至十年來最低水平2.8%，其後整年維持在低水平（圖3）。勞工需求與勞動人口同時增加，分別反映在總就業人數的回升（圖3）以及勞動人口的增加。考慮到香港的勞動力短缺情況，政府於2023年推出了多項勞動輸入計劃及人才吸引措施。同時，由於勞工市場緊張，名義工資及勞工收入的年同比增長率逐步回升至疫情前的水平。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n圖3 勞工市場情況\n來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在2023年初穩定後，第二季表現變得遲滯。恒生指數在2022年底延續反彈，於2023年1月27日收市報22,689點，創下年度高點。其後指數回落，並在12月進一步下跌至低水平（圖4），反映市場氣氛因美國及瑞士銀行體系問題於3月出現疲弱，加上第二季全球經濟前景較弱及金融狀況趨緊。恒生指數全年收市報17,047點，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，並連續第四年出現下跌。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n2023年前四個月，住宅物業市場因內地及香港恢復正常而出現反彈，但隨後因按揭利率上升及市場氣氛疲弱而有所軟化。整體而言，樓價全年下跌6.9%，成交量進一步下跌4.5%，至43,002單位，為歷史新低。置業負擔能力持續受壓，雖然樓價向下調整而略有改善。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面對壓力，辦公室、零售商舖及分層工廠大廈價格進一步軟化。辦公室租金因高空置率及在家工作安排日益普及，加上供應量增加而持續受壓。另一方面，零售商舖租金因入境旅遊業復甦及私人消費改善而在2023年上升。\n\n圖4

經濟環境\n\n2024年，香港經濟預期會以溫和步伐持續復甦。入境旅遊業將隨著處理能力的持續改善及政府推動大型活動的措施而進一步擴展，而本地消費活動則應受穩健勞工市場的支持。政府將推動的各項基建項目亦將為經濟提供支持。同時，香港的貨物出口預期將隨著全球科技周期的預期回升而穩定。政府預計2024年本地生產總值實質增長將在2.5%至3.5%之間。然而，多項風險和不確定性因素使前景蒙上陰霾，包括美國政策利率走勢、科技周期復甦速度、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷升級的國際政治緊張關係。\n\n# 物價上漲與勞工市場\n\n本地通脹預期在2024年將保持溫和，緩和的外部價格壓力有助於抵消經濟復甦及樓宇租金上升所帶來的國內成本上漲壓力。市場共識預測2024年的整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府預計整體及核心通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，勞工市場預期將因持續的經濟復甦而得到支撐，同時各項勞動力輸入及人才吸引計劃將繼續幫助緩解各行業的勞動力短缺。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行體系面對多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、由3月份美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機所引發的全球金融市場波動，以及內地及香港經濟復甦速度較預期為慢。儘管面對這些多重壓力，香港銀行體系仍保持穩健，並持續受到強勁的資本及流動性緩衝支持。儘管特定分類貸款比率上升，銀行體系的資產質素仍保持健康。銀行的盈利能力明顯改善，主要得益於淨利息收入增加。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率在2023年底升至1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%有所上升，同期逾期及經重組貸款比率亦由0.85%增至1.24%（圖5）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率亦由前一年的2.26%升至2023年底的2.58%。特定分類貸款比率上升主要是由於對內地房地產發展商的風險敞口被降級所致。不過，銀行所設立的撥備仍屬充足。信貸撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與特定分類貸款之比）在2023年底為75%。若考慮針對特定分類貸款所持有的抵押品市場價值，調整後的信貸撥備覆蓋率將達約145%。同時，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率在2023年底分別維持在0.08%及0.30%的低水平（圖6）。\n\n圖表

盈利趨勢\n\n銀行體系在2023年錄得顯著的利潤增長。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利較上年增加62.1%，而同期的除稅後平均資產回報率則由0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。利潤改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加30%，以及2023年持有作交易的投資出現顯著收益，相較於前一年輕微虧損。此部分效益被貸款減值撥備增加28%所抵銷，因針對新分類貸款已設立特殊準備金。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨息差於2023年擴大至1.68%，較前一年的1.31%有所提高（圖8）。同時，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2022年的48.0%下降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7

資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行體系的資產負債表在2023年增長了0.9%，其中可轉讓債務工具的增長（+8.6%）及銀行同業借款的增長（+4.4%）主要被貸款總額的下降所抵銷。由於借款成本上升及全球經濟前景疲軟，貸款需求低迷，貸款總額在2023年下降了3.6%。貸款總額中，用於香港的貸款大致維持穩定（-0.4%），而用於香港以外地區的貸款及貿易融資則分別下降了10.4%及13.1%。與大陸相關的貸款在2023年下降了6.6%。\n\n就負債方面而言，2023年存款總額較2022年的增長1.7%上升至5.1%。由於貸款總額下降而存款總額增加，貸存比率於2023年底由前一年的68.5%降至62.8%（圖表10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2023年銀行體系仍保持充足資本。截至2023年底，本地註冊的認可機構（AIs）合併總資本比率為21.1%，較前一年的20.1%有所提高。一級資本比率為18.9%（圖11）。這兩個比率均遠高於各自國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率在2023年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖表 10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n來源：金管局\n\n圖表 11 本地註冊 AIs

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90% Guarantee Product":["九成信貸擔保產品"],"$mart Money

貨幣穩定\n\n2023年，面對市場對「高利率維持較長時間」的美國政策利率預期，港元主要在兌換保證的弱方兌換保證範圍內交易，從2月中旬至5月初，弱方兌換保證共被觸發八次。自5月起，港元已恢復部分動力，年底時大致在7.8的中間價水平附近交易。在2023年慶祝其40週年的聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息一般與美元同業拆息相若，同時亦受本地供求因素影響。整體而言，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易順暢有序。作為香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其強大與對各種外部衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在 HK$7.75 至 HK$7.85 與 1 美元之間的範圍內。貨幣體制的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有 100% 由存於外匯基金的美元儲備所支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書，用以完全支持三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結餘，即存於金管局的結算賬戶餘額總和；以及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券（EFBNs）。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制及金管局對履行兌換保證（CUs）的堅定承諾來維持的。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發時，金管局會根據銀行的要求，以每美元7.75（或7.85）港元的匯率，準備出售（或購入）港元以換取美元。這會使總結餘擴大（或收窄），從而壓低（或推高）港元利率，協助港元匯率回復至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定\n\n面對市場對「高利率維持較久」的美國政策利率預期，2023年整年港元持續偏軟，主要在兌換保證的弱方兌換保證範圍內交易。從2月中旬至5月初，弱方兌換保證共被觸發八次。到了5月初至7月，港元匯率一度恢復部分強勢，部分原因是上市公司因股息支付而產生的資金需求，以及企業上半年結算資金需求所致。其後，港元匯率主要受本地資金需求變化影響，例如透過港股通南向的買盤流動，並在年底時大致維持在7.8的中間價水平（圖表1）。整體而言，2023年港元匯市持續正常運作。\n\n圖表 1 2023 年市場匯率\n\n二月至五月期間，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行的要求，在弱方兌換保證水平購入總額為港幣515億的貨幣。反映弱方兌換保證被啟動，總結餘由2022年底的港幣963億減少至2023年底的港幣450億。同時，全年外匯基金票據及債券的發行額則微升，由港幣1,2004億增至港幣1,2455億。因此，總結餘及外匯基金票據及債券的總額由2022年底的港幣1,2967億減少至2023年底的港幣1,2904億（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖2 2023年總結餘（貼現窗前）及 outstanding Exchange Fund 紙幣\n\n# 財務市場\n\n根據聯匯制度，香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）通常與其美元對應利率相若。在2023年首七個月美國持續加息的背景下，HIBOR通常上升（圖3）。全年而言，過夜、1個月及3個月HIBOR分別上升286、92及16個基點，至年底分別為6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n美國聯邦基金目標範圍上調後，基本利率已四次上調，總共上調一個百分點（即100個基點），從4.75%上調至5.75%。在零售層面，跟隨美國政策利率上調，多家銀行於5月初將最優惠貸款利率上調12.5個基點，並於7月下旬再上調12.5個基點。部分銀行亦在本年內提高新批按揭貸款中以香港銀行同業拆息為基礎的按揭利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的資金市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗貸款額由2022年的84億港元增至2023年的388億港元，相關用途未見異常。\n\n圖3

聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度已成為香港金融體系的強大支柱四十年，並展現出其強大及應對挑戰的韌性。儘管美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦仍存在持續不確定性，港元外匯及貨幣市場仍能有序運作，反映聯匯制度的穩健性。政府堅定支持聯匯制度。在2023年對外部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，聯匯制度的聲譽已由一套透明的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系及謹慎的財政框架所確保。\n\n健全的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系持續順利運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率在國際標準下表現極佳。為確保銀行體系的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行在信貸、流動性及利率風險管理方面的表現，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對銀行借款的監管工作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從外匯基金資產中劃出特定部分，用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）由2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的高點112.71%，超過了觸發上限112.5%（圖4）。這主要是由於年初上半年觸發了弱方兌換保證，導致總結餘出現收縮。根據外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，並因負債證明書的贖回，資產已從支持組合轉移至投資組合，使支持比率於5月8日降至約109.97%。其後，支持比率穩步上升，至12月31日收市為110.73%。根據聯匯制度，雖然特定的外匯基金資產已被指定用作支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。外匯基金充足的財政資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣與金融穩定提供了強大的後盾。\n\n圖4

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行體系在2023年面對多項挑戰，包括3月份在美國及歐洲發生的銀行危機、高利率環境及地緣政治緊張局勢，仍然保持強大和韌性。金管局迅速回應3月份的銀行危機，從處理傳遞效應到完成內部檢討（涵蓋監管程序及解決框架等範疇），為本地銀行體系汲取經驗，同時持續關注認可機構的信用、流動性及市場風險管理。面對不斷升級的網絡威脅及第三方提供的科技服務使用量增加，金管局亦與認可機構緊密合作，提升其運營及網絡韌性。\n\n金管局加強了對支付卡方面的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂銀行營運守則及發起《保障消費者防詐騙約章》。金管局與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產相關活動建立平衡的監管制度，為高端專業投資者簡化銷售程序，並對「跨境理財通」業務試點作出改進，同時開始監管信託業務。為準備提供「信資通」下的個人信貸資料服務，金管局亦啟動了一項試點計劃。\n\n金管局在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，體現了以風險為本的方法，針對最高威脅作出應對。為應對日益增加的數碼騙案，金管局透過啟動實時詐騙監測及擴展公私合作資訊共享的範疇，加強生態圈各持份者的合作，包括詐騙及洗錢情報小組。啟動一個突破性的平台，促進銀行間資訊共享，將有助應對傀儡戶口網絡的風險，同時，金管局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理日益增加的與詐騙相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對不同詐騙手法的認識，包括在使用轉數快系統時啟動可疑識別代號警示機制。同時，亦透過傀儡戶口網絡分析先導計劃，進一步提升監管科技能力。\n\n在落實國際監管標準方面，本地已取得良好進展，包括資本充足及披露標準。同時，亦在銀行體系的專業能力提升方面作出顯著努力，吸引及培育未來人才，並提升現有從業人員的專業技能。此外，香港存款保障委員會已完成就存款保障計劃擬議改進措施的公眾諮詢。\n\n金管局持續推進工作，以確保可信的處置機制。有關接觸關鍵金融市場基建的處置標準已制定完成，並已完成對實施吸收虧損能力政策標準的經驗回顧。與銀行就處置計劃取得重大進展，以應對早期終止風險及確保處置過程中的運作持續性。金管局亦持續積極參與國際政策倡議及地區層面的處置合作。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於一個高度具備韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，可能影響系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，更可能以混亂方式出現失敗。作為監管機構，金融管理專員在確保銀行能抵禦衝擊並在危機中恢復其地位，從而協助預防失敗方面，發揮關鍵作用。金融管理專員負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的授權，這些機構合稱為認可機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非設計用以確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金融管理專員作為處置機制當局，旨在確保在認可機構變得不可持續時，其失敗情況可以有序處理。為此，香港已建立針對金融機構的處置機制，其中金融管理專員為認可機構及其他類型機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，重要的是制定處置規則及政策標準，進行處置計劃以消除對認可機構可處置性的阻礙，並提升金管局處理失敗認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採用國際上協調一致的處理方式。\n\n金管局亦負責某些金融市場基建（FMIs）的指定及監管。在監管FMIs時，金管局旨在促進其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並提升透明度。使FMIs更具抗金融危機能力，可保護香港的貨幣及金融體系免受因FMIs受擾而產生的可能破壞性影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n本年，金管局向兩家在香港註冊的銀行發出一張銀行牌照及一張有限制的銀行牌照。金管局亦向四間外資交易平臺營運商發出貨幣經紀批准，並撤銷一間貨幣經紀的批准。本年，金管局亦撤銷五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n更多有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的資料，請參見附錄及第313至316頁和第322至325頁的表格D至F。\n\n# 銀行三級制評述\n\n2023年，金管局對香港的銀行三級制進行全面檢討，以簡化香港的銀行體系結構。檢討結果顯示，現行的三級制已變得比原來為達致在進入銀行體系的靈活性與保護小額存款人之間取得平衡所必需的複雜程度更高。隨後，金管局於六月展開三個月的諮詢，就建議將銀行三級制簡化為兩級，將接受存款公司納入受限制牌照銀行範疇，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第二級，以推行該建議。回應者普遍支持該建議。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2023年，金管局進行了177次非現場審查，覆蓋範圍廣泛的議題，包括資本充足率評級評估、機構管治及風險管理。作為金管局持續推動強化風險治理的其中一環，金管局與認可機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層委員會舉行了38次會面。此外，金管局亦與認可機構及其外部核數師舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除離場活動外，金管局亦定期對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查。在高利率環境及部分內地房地產發展商出現債務違約的情況下，信用風險管理成為重點關注事項，因當前信用風險環境較為嚴峻。同時，業務運作風險及科技風險的管理亦成為另一重點，因認可機構對科技的採用正不斷加快。金管局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出一輪以氣候相關風險治理為主題的專題審查，以及一系列諮詢會議，以向認可機構提供監管指引。\n\n2023年3月開始的美國和歐洲銀行危機，是自2008年金融危機以來規模和範圍最為顯著的系統性銀行危機。在危機持續期間，金管局一直保持高度警覺，並採取多項預防性措施，以確保任何潛在後果不會損害本地銀行及金融體系的信心。事件過後，金管局根據危機期間所觀察到的情況及經驗進行了內部檢討。根據此次檢討，金管局制定了詳細的行動計劃，以吸收所學經驗，強化監管成效，並提升處理銀行危機的能力。如欲了解更多有關金管局在此方面的工作細節，請參閱第95頁的「流動性及市場風險」部分。\n\n在行為監管方面，金管局就證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務以及消費者保護事宜進行現場審查，並輔以針對高風險領域或新舉措的主題審查。\n\n表1總結了金管局2023年的監管活動。\n\n表1 監督活動總結\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n貸款總額在2023年下降了3.6%，較2022年的下降3.0%有所減少。表2顯示貸款及融資的增長分解情況。中國內地相關貸款在2023年減少6.6%至4,226億港元（見表3）。\n\n表2 貸款及融資增長\n\n表3 中國內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，由於高利率環境及內地物業市場持續疲弱，金管局加強了對認可機構資產質素的監察，並評估其風險管理做法。整體銀行體系的資產質素在該年度有所惡化，但仍然可管理。截至2023年底，銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。與內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n本年度，金管局進行了針對性及主題性審查，評估認可機構的信貸風險管理，重點包括對易受影響行業的 exposures、保單貸款、香港以外地區信貸風險的監督以及對非銀行金融機構的 exposures。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶所面臨的現金流壓力\n\n金管局及銀行體系中小企業貸款協調機制於七月宣布，有序退出預先批核還息不還本計劃。該計劃於2020年5月推出，旨在協助符合資格的企業渡過疫情。考慮商業界意見後，已加強部分本金還款選項，協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。對於疫情結束後仍面臨困難的行業或個別借款人，銀行會根據個案情況，繼續提供本金寬限期或其他適合的信貸緩解措施。\n\n金管局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與計劃但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業的資金需求時，能表現同理心。金管局提醒銀行在處理遇到償還問題的企業時，應遵循「香港處理企業困難指引」，以便各銀行能為貸款人共同利益而協同行動。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n自2009年起，金管局推行的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施已加強銀行對物業按揭貸款業務的風險管理，並提升銀行體系應對物業價格急跌所帶來挑戰的能力。2023年批准的新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）為57%，較2009年9月首次推行逆周期措施前的64%為低（圖1）。2023年新按揭貸款的平均還款比率（DSR）仍維持在較低水平，為40%，與2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%相若。\n\n7月7日，金管局在考慮樓價、交易量以及本地及國際經濟環境等因素後，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。這是自2009年推出住宅物業逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施以來，首次放寬相關措施。此次調整包括提高住宅物業、商業物業以及根據抵押貸款申請人資產水平評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款與價值比率（LTV）。此外，亦取消了對主要收入來自香港以外地區的按揭申請人，須降低適用最高LTV比率及債務服務比率（DSR）上限十個百分點的要求。金管局亦取消了當按揭申請人的總按揭融資超出金管局正常允許LTV上限二十個百分點時，須對適用DSR上限減五個百分點的要求。\n\n圖表

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心的地位方面取得顯著進展。\n\n兩項重大活動，即國際金融領袖投資峰會及香港金融管理局–國際結算銀行高級別會議的成功舉辦，進一步鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生正面的傳遞效應。\n\n金管局與其內地及香港的同業協力合作，致力深化及拓展香港與內地金融市場之間的互通性。這包括在粵港澳大灣區推進跨境理財通計劃的優化、為債券通「南向通」指定更多做市商、成功啟動北向互換通交易，以及推行港元人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台莊家機制。這些舉措有效地強化了香港作為國際離岸人民幣業務中心的門戶地位，並鞏固了該市作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局亦在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面取得良好進展，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融以及企業財資中心等領域。為推廣香港的金融服務，金管局加強了對海外及內地持份者的市場拓展活動，使其充分了解香港金融市場的機會及其韌性。\n\n金管局「金融科技2025」策略在各個方面均有顯著進展，包括推動金融科技應用、央行數碼貨幣、數據基建、人才培育以及政策及資金支援等領域。\n\n轉數快（FPS）於九月慶祝成立五周年。登記人數持續穩定增長，截至2023年底已達1360萬。該系統全年平均每日交易量增至125萬筆實時交易。FPS與PromptPay於十二月聯合啟動跨境二維碼支付互聯服務，實現香港與泰國之間的跨境二維碼支付，為兩地來往人士提供快速、安全且易於使用的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n作為多個國際及地區性中央銀行及監管論壇的積極參與者，金管局持續為維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展的全球努力作出貢獻。\n\n# 總覽\n\n全年來，金管局持續積極努力，加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。11月，金管局第二年舉辦國際金融領袖投資峰會。這場持續三日的活動，邀請來自世界各地的知名金融領袖，在「駕馭複雜的環境」主題下分享他們獨特的觀點。逾350名來自160間國際金融機構的參與者出席，顯示全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。當月，金管局與國際結算銀行（BIS）共同主辦金管局－BIS高層會議，吸引逾300名參與者，包括逾20位現任及前任央行行長。該會議突顯金管局與BIS以及與中央銀行界緊密的合作關係。\n\n內地與香港通訳計劃的擴展及改進措施，進一步鞏固了香港作為內地與國際金融市場橋樑的角色。為促進粵港澳大灣區（GBA）的跨境零售投資，一系列針對跨境理財通（跨境理財通）計劃的改進措施已推出。借助南向債券通順利運作，金管局指定九家額外做市商，以提升二級市場流動性並滿足投資者需求。今年成功啟動北向互換通交易，使全球投資者能透過香港更好地管理其內地固定收益投資組合所涉及的利率風險。\n\n香港的離岸人民幣業務在本年度實現了穩健增長。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）合作，於六月啟動了港元人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台莊家機制。這有助於在香港發展更多元化的人民幣計價產品，促進在香港發行及交易人民幣計價股票。\n\n金管局繼續推動強化香港金融平台的競爭力。特別是為提升香港作為優先資產管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，提供更為便利的稅務及監管環境。同時，在推動香港債券市場創新及鞏固香港作為區域綠色和可持續金融中心的定位方面亦取得顯著進展。同時，金管局亦加強市場拓展活動，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及金管局的銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略1，以推廣金融科技（金融科技）的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的定位。本年度推行的主要措施包括：\n- 推動財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式賬本技術（DLT）等科技重點領域的進一步應用；\n- 推進 Wholesale 央行數碼貨幣（CBDC）的工作，以改善跨境支付；\n- 繼續推進在香港引入零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即數碼港元 e-HKD）的可行性研究；\n- 加強發展商業數據通（CDI）的相關工作；\n- 提升人才培育；\n- 透過資金及政策培育金融科技生態系統；\n- 強化金融科技領域的跨境合作；以及\n- 推廣使用轉數快（FPS）。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及高效運作，對維持該市作為國際金融中心的領導地位至關重要。2023年，四間銀行間實時付款結算（RTGS）系統、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易資料儲存庫（HKTR）實現了100%系統可用性，超越了99.95%的目標。債務證券結算服務，包括北向及南向債券通聯通服務，繼續順利運作。\n\n2023年，FPS的使用持續增加，標誌著FPS迎來成立五週年的重大里程碑。過去五年，FPS的註冊數量及交易額穩步增長，截至2023年底，註冊數量已增至1360萬，而全年平均每日交易額較2022年上升33%。FPS在處理政府帳單、零售商戶支付及為儲值支付工具（SVF）電子錢包或銀行賬戶增值等方面的使用增加，成為推動交易量持續上升的關鍵因素，加上個人對個人及企業支付的穩定增長。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局監管六個指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據支付條例（PSSVFO）監督17間持牌儲值支付工具營運商（SVFs），其中四間為由持牌銀行發行的儲值支付工具營運商。本年度，金管局亦繼續協助推動政府消費券計劃的順利落實，協助協調相關政府部門及為該計劃指定的儲值支付工具持牌人，並促進他們之間的溝通與合作。\n\n於12月27日，財經事務及庫務局與金管局 jointly

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023.\n\nSee pages 205 to 311 for the audited 2023 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the

儲備管理\n\n2023年的投資環境波動且充滿挑戰。雖然年初美國和歐洲一些銀行出現了流動性問題，但相關風險並未擴散至金融市場。儘管主要發達經濟體的通脹水平自2023年達到高峰後有所下降，但仍高於主要央行所設定的目標。在經歷了積極的加息周期後，美國聯邦儲備局自第三季度起暫停加息，並表示利率可能已處於或接近頂部。這加上美國經濟的強韌表現，使投資者情緒變得更加樂觀。然而，持續的國際政治緊張局勢，例如俄羅斯與烏克蘭戰爭以及本年中東地區爆發衝突，為投資市場帶來了更多波動與不確定性。在這複雜且動態的投資環境下，外匯基金的投資表現出現了一些波動。儘管如此，外匯基金仍成功實現了相當不錯的投資回報。2023年，外匯基金錄得投資收入高達2260億港元，投資回報率為5.5%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》所訂明的主要目標，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的兌換價值。該基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全，以協助香港維持國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長的委任權，在委任範圍內，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）為外匯基金設定了以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 保有資本；\n(ii) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高度流動的美元資產支持；\n(iii) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣與金融穩定；及\n(iv) 以(i)至(iii)為前提，達致有助於維持外匯基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標已全面考慮外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的組合架構及目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資組合類別\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金擁有兩個主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合（BP）持有高度流動的美元資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合（IP）則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以維持其資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並在中長遠提升回報，金管局以謹慎及逐步的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資分散至較廣泛的資產類別。這些資產類別包括新興市場及內地債券及股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券及股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP 的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的目標配置同時確定，並遵循謹慎的風險管理原則及資產配置多元化策略。\n\n於2007年成立的策略性資產組合，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由政府為外匯基金的戰略目的而購入。由於其獨特性質，策略性資產組合不包括在基金的投資表現評估之中。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金有時會接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的 placements。利率通常與投資組合1的表現掛鉤。一個主要例外是未來基金2，其利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鉤，並根據組合比重而定。2023年，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合之間的組合比重約為35:65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序是以兩種類型的資產配置決定為基礎：策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準上，代表根據外匯基金投資目標所進行的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰略性配置，以期取得超越基準的回報。這意味著實際的資產配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準及追蹤誤差上限是由財政司與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後確定，但戰略性決定及戰略性偏離的允許範圍則是由金管局在授權下作出並設定。在戰略性偏離的允許範圍內，投資組合經理可根據短期市場變動而採取相應的投資立場。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室負責處理外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理功能。外匯基金投資辦公室的員工直接管理約71%的外匯基金投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。由內部管理的投資組合部分，包括投資於環球定息市場的一組投資組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的多種衍生工具。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘請外聘投資經理管理約29%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是借助市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以實現可持續的投資回報，同時亦能融合多樣化且互補的投資風格，並善用外部市場見解及投資方面的專業技術。\n\n與使用外聘投資經理相關的支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費及預扣稅及其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，良好的風險管理變得越來越重要。金管局為其內部及外部管理的投資組合設立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並確保適當的風險監察及合規制度已落實。為有效實施風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已設立三重防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸風險、市場風險、流動性及業務操作風險）會定期監測。風險管理程序提供一個穩健的框架，支持金管局的策略制定及投資多元化努力。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局認為，適當強調負責任投資及可持續長期表現，有助更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，同時亦可降低其基礎投資在環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關事宜所涉及的風險。為落實負責任投資實踐，金管局已將ESG因素納入外匯基金的投資過程，其指導原則是，若ESG投資的長期經風險調整長期收益與其他投資相若，通常會優先考慮ESG投資。如欲了解更多有關金管局負責任投資工作的詳情，請參閱二零二三年可持續發展報告的「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2023年的金融市場\n\n2023年的投資環境波動且充滿挑戰。\n\n全球股市在2023年整體呈上升趨勢。標普500指數全年上漲24%，尤其是在第四季，市場開始預期央行較預期更快降息。\n\n在債市中，收益率持續高企，美國10年期國債收益率一度攀升至逾5%，達到自2007年以來的最高水平。然而，隨著市場對全球主要央行的貨幣政策預期出現變化，債券收益率在年底逐漸回落，同時債券價格也逐步上升。\n\n在貨幣市場，美元對主要貨幣表現不一。其中，英鎊和歐元對美元升值，而日圓和人民幣則貶值。\n\n2023年主要貨幣、債市及股市的表現如表1所示。\n\n表1 2023年市場回報\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2023年錄得投資收入高達2260億港元，其中包括債券收益1447億港元、股票收益581億港元（其中來自外資股票的收益為736億港元，來自香港本地股票的虧損為155億港元），非港元資產的負面貨幣兌換影響為5億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司所持其他投資的收益237億港元。另外，策略性資產組合錄得估值虧損48億港元。\n\n外匯基金資產總值於年底達 HK$4,0165 億。長期增長組合下的投資總市值為 HK$5173 億，其中私募股權為 HK$4119 億，房地產為 HK$1054 億。長期增長組合的已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為 HK$2911 億。\n\n2023年外匯基金的投資回報（不計策略性資產組合）為5.5%。投資組合及支持組合的回報率分別為6.4%及5.0%。長期增長組合自2009年成立以來，已錄得年率化內部回報率11.8%。\n\n1994年至2023年外匯基金的年度回報請參見圖1。表2顯示2023年的投資回報，以及基金在不同年期的平均投資回報。2021至2023年的平均回報為1.6%，2019至2023年為3.3%，2014至2023年為2.7%，自1994年起則為4.5%。表3顯示2023年12月31日基金資產的貨幣比重。\n\n請參閱第205至311頁，以獲取外匯基金經審核的2023年財務報表。\n\n圖表

The HKMA’s major summit and conferences, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are livestreamed on its social media channels to enhance participation by the public and the industry. The HKMA also develops creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives. Recent content covered topics such as consumer protection and scam prevention, the Faster Payment System, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and major events of the HKMA.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for the public looking to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Public Enquiry Service handled 9,565 enquiries. About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins.

The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the BO.\n\nYoung visitors learn about the design of banknotes in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre\n\nGuided tour of the Information Centre for kindergarten students\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nSince 1998, the HKMA has been running a public education programme that reaches out to the community to raise public awareness of its work. To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee Product":["八成信貸擔保產品"],"$90% Guarantee Product":["九成信貸擔保產品"],"$mart

財務申報\n\n為維持高水平的透明度，金管局在適用於中央銀行運作的範圍內，採用國際財務披露標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的數據公布特殊標準。財務處會與外部會計師及其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告準則編製及呈報外匯基金的財務報表。金管局亦在其年報中提供詳盡的披露及深入分析各種費用項目及預算資料。\n\n# 問責性與控制措施\n\n# 風險管理\n\n金管局其中一項最重要的任務，是管理貨幣及銀行體系所面對的風險。風險管理既在日常運作中於工作層面進行，亦在較高層面透過策略制定進行。兩個高層級委員會，即宏觀監察委員會及風險委員會，均在金管局的風險管理框架下運作，並由金管局總裁擔任主席。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","terms":{"\"Credit Data Smart\" pilot programme":["信資通計劃"],"$80% Guarantee

觀點\n\n本人確認已審計外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，載於第211至311頁，包括外匯基金及集團於2023年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重大會計政策資料。\n\n在我看來，財務報表真實而中肯地反映了外匯基金及集團於2023年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該財務狀況在該會計年度內的財務表現及現金流，並符合香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」），且已按照根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條由行政長官作出的指示適當編製。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據香港特別行政區行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據這些準則，我的職責已在我的報告中「財務報表審計的會計師職責」一節中進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立於集團，並已按照這些準則履行其他倫理責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為在我專業判斷下，於審計2023年12月31日結賬年度財務報表時具有最重大意義的事項。這些事項是在審計財務報表整體的過程中處理，並在形成我的意見時考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金融管理專員負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港金融管理專員2023年年報中所載的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的核數師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不包括其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中所獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否明顯存在重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此情況。就此事而言，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表的職責\n\n金融管理專員負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條由行政長官作出的指示，編製能真實而中肯地反映財務報表，並就金融管理專員認為有必要以確保財務報表不存在重大錯報（無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致）之內部控制措施。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員有責任評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 审計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確認整體財務報表在重大錯誤或舞弊的情況下是否不存在重大不正確，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不代表根據審計署的審計準則進行的審計，總能發現已存在的重大不正確。重大不正確可能源自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合計起來，可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n根據審計署的審計準則進行審計的過程中，我始終行使專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別並評估財務報表中重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行與這些風險相關的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，以作為我意見的基礎。未能發現因詐欺所致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤所致的風險，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制；  \n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但此目的並非用以表達對集團內部控制有效性意見；  \n- 評估金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否適當，以及會計估計的合理性及其相關披露是否恰當；  \n- 對金融管理專員使用持續經營基礎會計的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計憑證，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我有責任在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，或在披露不充分的情況下修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我審計師報告日期所取得的審計憑證作出的。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營的實體；  \n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露情況，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現實體交易和事件的方式反映這些交易和事件；  \n- 取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊足夠且適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就審計的預計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現等事項進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中所識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提供聲明，表明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項，我確定在當前會計期間財務報表審計中最具重大意義的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或規例禁止披露有關事項，或在極少數情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果將合理地超過披露該事項對公共利益的效益，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n林志源教授\n審計署署長\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長授權，作為外匯基金（該基金）的總監，按《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。該基金的主要業務是維護香港貨幣的兌換價值，並保持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性和完整性。\n\n本基金的資產被管理為四個組合：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。支持組合的資產完全與香港的貨幣基礎相匹配，根據香港的貨幣發行局制度。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債市及股市。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為本基金戰略目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。經營分部資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 二、物料會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，香港財務報告準則是一項總稱，包括所有適用的個別 HKFRSs、香港會計師公會頒佈的香港會計準則及解釋，以及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（以下統稱為集團）採用的主要會計政策如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新訂或修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於集團當前會計期間首次生效或可提前採用。附註3提供有關這些發展首次應用所導致的會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並說明這些變更對這些財務報表中所反映的當前及前會計期間內集團而言是否相關。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務於附註16及17中列示。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債是以公平值計量：\n- 衍生金融工具（參見附註 2.6）；\n- 以收支帳目計量的金融資產及金融負債（參見附註 2.6）；\n- 以其他全面收益計量的金融資產（參見附註 2.6）；\n- 黃金（參見附註 2.10）；以及\n- 投資物業（參見附註 2.11）。\n\n依香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需管理層作出影響政策應用及資產、負債、收入及開支所報告金額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設基於歷史經驗及其他各項因素，並在當時情況下認為合理，其結果成為作出有關資產及負債攜帶價值判斷的基礎，而這些攜帶價值並非來自其他來源。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數及相關假設會持續進行審查。若修正僅影響當期，則會在該估計數修正的期間內確認會計估計數的修正；若修正同時影響當期及未來期間，則會在修正期間及其後的各期內確認會計估計數的修正。\n\n管理在應用 HKFRSs 時所作出的，對財務報表有重大影響的判斷，以及主要的估計不確定性來源，於附註 2.18 中披露。\n\n部分 comparative figures 已重新表述，以符合集團財務報表當前年度的列示方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n子公司為由集團控制的實體。集團控制一實體，是指集團因參與該實體而有權獲得變動回報，或有權取得變動回報，且能透過對該實體的控制權影響這些回報。評估集團是否有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他方所持有）。\n"}
