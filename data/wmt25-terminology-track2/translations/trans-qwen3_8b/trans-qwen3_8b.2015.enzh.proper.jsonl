{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年出現較慢的增長，反映本地需求較弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長將繼續疲軟，面對嚴峻的外部環境壓力及不穩定的金融市場情況。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 總覽\n\n香港的經濟增長在本年有所放緩，實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長放慢至2.4%，較2014年的2.6%減緩（見表1）。這反映本地需求擴張較為溫和，不過淨出口重新成為推動GDP增長的正面因素，因總進口下降速度高於總出口（見圖1）。儘管經濟表現相對平穩，勞工市場則大致維持穩定，失業率保持在較低水平，約為3.3%。通脹進一步緩和，這是因本地成本及進口價格的上漲壓力有所減退。本地股市在環球金融市場波動加劇的情況下出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月公布第七輪審慎監管措施後開始趨於軟化，住宅價格在年尾進一步顯示出整固跡象。\n\n圖表 1 實際本地生產總值增長貢獻\n\n表1 支出組成別實質GDP成長率（期別對期別）\n\n注意：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度資料不可用。\n來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年維持了匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率維持在約7.75水平。由於與股權相關的資金流入，4月觸發了強方兌換保證，並在9月和10月再次觸發，反映離岸人民幣轉換為港元以及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總結餘擴大，本地利率持續維持在低水平，而金管局基本利率則在12月中美國加息後上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，銀行體系的總貸款增長進一步放緩，2015年總貸款增長為3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降。銀行業整體貸款質素略有惡化，但特定分類貸款比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求在2015年的增長速度放緩。雖然就業和收入情況整體穩定，繼續提供支持，但較弱的消費者信心及資產價格調整對私人消費增長造成壓力，尤其在年中後期。然而，由於上半年增長動力較強，全年私人消費增長由2014年的3.3%增至4.8%。政府消費則略微加快，增長3.4%。事實上，本地需求增長放緩主要是由於本地固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（圖2）。私人部門機械設備採購連續第二年出現下滑，這與營商氣氛惡化有關，同時樓宇及建造活動也顯示出較弱的增長動力，與公共工程項目進展緩慢同步。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年惡化（圖3）。貨品出口出現廣泛下跌，跌幅為1.7%，為自2009年以來首次出現跌幅。出口至日本及歐盟的貨品均有所下降，而出口至美國則僅有微幅增長。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求亦對區域工業活動及區內貿易造成壓力。因此，香港對內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體較弱的中間及最終需求而有所下降。香港的服務輸出持續從過去幾年的高速增長路徑放緩，導致2015年出現0.6%的跌幅，主要由於訪港旅遊業放緩。貨品進口亦因較弱的國內及出口引致需求而回落。相對而言，服務輸入的增長加快，這是因本地居民旅遊意欲強勁所致。總體而言，2015年香港的貿易順差略有改善，對本地生產總值增長作出溫和的正面貢獻。\n\n圖2 本地需求\n來源：政府統計處\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n基本通脹率在2015年進一步緩和，因國內成本壓力有所減緩，進口價格通脹亦下降。扣除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖4）。經濟活動較為疲弱，勞工成本壓力維持穩定，而商業及工業租金成本壓力則有所緩和，尤其在第二季後更為明顯。得益於全球商品價格回落及港元走強，進口價格壓力減退，食品價格通脹亦維持低水平。由於前期新租約住宅租金的傳導效應較為溫和，通脹的租金組成項目仍受到控制。\n\n圖3

勞工市場\n\n2015年勞工市場情況保持穩定。勞工需求維持不變，與貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業減少被其他行業穩健的招聘速度所抵消，導致總體就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。同時，勞工供應也增加1.3%，季節性調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%的水平（圖表5）。考慮到勞工市場仍然緊俏，今年前三個季度名義工資增幅達4.7%，較2014年的4.3%有所提高。隨著通脹壓力緩和，實質工資在前三個季度增加1.3%，較2014年下跌0.1%有所改善。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市因外部環境劇變而經歷了一個波動的年份。在首季表現平穩後，受內地A股市場樂觀情緒及資金流入的推動，本地股市在第二季表現強勁。4月恒生指數升至七年高位，滬港通下的港股通每日額度首次用盡（圖6）。然而，自今年年中末期起，本地股市轉趨下跌，恒生指數在9月下跌28%，創下一年來新低，這主要是由於內地A股市場及全球股市的拋售潮、全球外匯市場波動加劇，以及國際商品價格走弱所致。隨著全球及內地金融市場穩定，香港股市在第四季有所回復。整體而言，2015年恒生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而每日平均成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。雖然第二季後集資活動有所減緩，但來自本地股市的集資總額仍由去年同期的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整固跡象。在2015年初經歷了一段活躍時期後，隨着二月宣布實施第七輪審慎監管措施，住宅物業市場隨後有所放緩。住宅價格在去年第四季出現回落，整體增幅較為緩慢，2015年住宅價格累計上升2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%增幅（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期下降12.3%，至55,982單位，因第二季後期次級市場交易活動明顯減少。炒賣活動，包括確認人交易及短期轉售交易，持續保持低水平。儘管如此，置業負擔能力依然緊張，樓價與收入比率達到15.7，收入槓桿比率遠高於其長期平均水平。工商物業市場在上半年表現活躍，但隨後交易活動放緩，價格及租金在去年第四季均出現下跌。租金收益率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低水平附近。\n\n圖表

經濟環境\n\n香港2016年的經濟增長預期將持續疲軟。私營機構分析員預測經濟將以較慢的平均增長率1.7%擴張，而政府預計增長幅度將在1至2%之間。更具體而言，疲弱的全球增長前景、持續低迷的訪港旅遊業以及全球金融市場波動所帶來的負面影響，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。在國內方面，私人消費預期將 moderately 增長，因勞工市場情況在經濟動能較弱的情況下可能面臨一定壓力，而本地資產價格調整或會影響消費信心，並引發負面財富效應。樓宇及建造活動或可維持穩定，但營商氣氛低迷及利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 物價上漲與勞工市場\n\n通脹壓力預期在2016年仍會受到控制。進口價格壓力將大致保持緩和，而在經濟增長動力溫和的情況下，國內成本壓力預期也會保持溫和。通脹的租金組成項目也可能因2015年底新租賃住宅租金壓力減退而有所緩和。市場共識預測2016年的整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府預測基本通脹率為2.0%。由於訪港旅遊業放緩及出口行業持續疲軟，勞工市場也可能略微放緩。私營機構分析員現時預期失業率將在2016年上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2016年的經濟前景面臨不少不確定性和風險。特別是美國利率進一步上升的步調、全球增長前景及商品價格走勢，將繼續是主要的不確定因素。任何重大不利發展都可能增加全球金融市場及國際資金流動的波動，從而 tighten 本地貨幣及金融條件，並對香港的增長前景造成陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將在很大程度上取決於它們透過財富及資產負債表效應對物業市場的影響。雖然物業市場正面臨來自全球及本地金融市場情緒走弱、美國利率正常化以及住宅需求與供應缺口收窄的下行風險，但尚需更多時間才能確定物業市場是否已進入下行週期。雖然物業市場的突然調整可能對整體經濟造成重大阻力，但過去幾年引入的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施及其他監管措施，已顯著增強香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在本年度保持強韌，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體的風險積聚。認可機構（AIs）的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊認可機構資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略有惡化，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n配合美元利率，整年香港美元銀行同業拆息均維持在低水平。零售銀行的港元資金成本在年初出現下降，反映綜合利率呈下行趨勢，其後在下半年保持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖7 香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）\n說明：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）指由香港銀行公會發佈的港元利息結算率，為月度平均數。\n\n2. BlR 指香港上海銀行有限公司（每月平均）所報的最優惠貸款利率。\n\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n2015年銀行體系的盈利能力有所放緩。零售銀行在香港的總體除稅前經營溢利下降2.8%，雖然費用及佣金收入增長9.7%、外匯及衍生工具業務收入增長22.4%、淨利息收入增長1.3%，但經營開支增加8.8%及貸款減值準備增加76%所帶來的影響抵消了這些增長。然而，零售銀行的除稅後溢利卻上升了14.7%，主要由於戰略投資處置所產生的利潤。零售銀行的除稅後平均資產回報率由2014年的0.99%提升至1.05%（圖8）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

貨幣穩定\n\n港元兌美元匯率在2015年整體維持廣泛穩定，即使面對金融市場波動及12月美國加息的情況。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行同業流動資金充足。作為香港過去數十年維持金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度持續對外在衝擊保持高度韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在 HK$7.75 至 HK$7.85 等值 1 美元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有 100% 由存放在外匯基金的美元儲備所支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包含\n\n* 負債證明書，用以 fully backing 三間發鈔銀行發行的紙幣  \n* 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣  \n* 總結餘，即銀行存於金管局的結算賬戶結餘總和  \n* 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券\n\n港元兌美元匯率的穩定是由自動利率調節機制以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證（Convertibility Undertakings, CUs）的承諾所維持。當對港元的需求大於供應，市場匯率上揚至強方兌換保證 HK$7.75 至 1 美元時，金管局會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總結餘將隨之擴張，推動港元利率下降，創造出使港元離開強方上限、重新回到 7.75 至 7.85 的兌換範圍內的貨幣條件。相反，如果港元的供應大於需求，市場匯率下跌至弱方兌換保證 HK$7.85 至 1 美元時，金管局會從銀行購入港元。總結餘將隨之收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元離開弱方上限，並維持在兌換範圍內。\n\nherein 所顯示的負債證明書及政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣，均以港幣面值列示。本年度報告中外匯基金資產負債表所顯示的相應項目，則以與該項負債在資產負債表日期的現行匯率下所需兌換的美元金額相等的港幣金額列示。此安排符合香港公認的會計準則。\n\nherein 所顯示的外匯基金票據及債券金額，與本年度報告中外匯基金的資產負債表所載的金額有所不同。根據香港公認的會計準則，金管局代表外匯基金就其在外匯基金票據及債券二級市場的交易所持有的外匯基金票據及債券，會與所發行的外匯基金票據及債券相互抵銷，並以淨額記入資產負債表。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 幣值穩定\n\n2015年港元兌美元匯率大致維持穩定，波動範圍維持在7.7500至7.7657之間（圖表1）。年初時，市場對美國加息的擔憂，使港元略受貶值壓力。然而，第二季港元兌美元匯率上漲至接近7.75，4月期間因股市活動熱絡，與股市相關的港元需求增加，強方兌換保證被多次觸發。進入年下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著沽售，以及全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動增加，港元兌美元匯率仍維持在接近7.75的水平。受離岸人民幣轉換為港元的影響，9月及10月期間強方兌換保證再次被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25基點，但港元兌美元匯率仍維持在窄幅範圍內，並無顯著資金流出壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場波動，2015年港元兌美元匯率市場運作有序。\n\n圖表 1 2015 年市場匯率\n\n由於強方兌換保證在四月、九月及十月多次被觸發，金管局根據貨幣發行局原則，被動向銀行購入總值293億美元的外幣，以換取2,272億港元，導致總結餘相應擴張，其中部分擴張被銀行強烈的流動性管理需求所引致的外匯基金票據額外發行所抵銷（圖2）。外匯基金票據的額外發行與貨幣發行局原則一致，因為這代表貨幣基礎組成的變化，而貨幣基礎完全由外匯儲備支持。總結餘與外匯基金票據及債券的總額在2015年底增至1,2210億港元，較一年前的9925億港元有所增加。\n\n圖2 2015年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n銀行體系內流動性充足，香港銀行同業拆息在2015年整體維持於低水平。美國聯邦基金利率的目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）自0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%，根據預設公式，香港基本利率亦於12月17日自0.5%上調至0.75%。2015年整體而言，由隔夜至三個月期的銀行同業拆息均低於基本利率（圖3），其波動主要由銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場波動情況下流動性收緊所帶動。香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）之間的利差大致趨勢，反映香港美元遠期匯率點子於8月因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著 premiums，其後因美國美元利率出現廣泛上調，於年底時回落至discounts（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗貸款活動不顯著，2015年僅有約28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖3 2015年港元銀行同業拆息\n\n圖4 2015年港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年中對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了重大貢獻。考慮到香港經濟規模小而開放，且作為國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定承諾維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，市民對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存工具的信心持續強勁。在2015年對香港進行的第四條磋商（Article IV consultation）中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續支持聯繫匯率制度為香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港強健的制度、法律及政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及穩健的金融體系是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n由於健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的正常運作至關重要，金管局繼續緊密監察銀行對信用、流動性及利率風險以及壓力測試結果的管理，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管工作，以提升銀行體系的抗風險能力。考慮到美國利率上升，金管局提醒公眾做好管理風險的必要準備，並指出觸發弱方兌換保證及港元流出是港元利率正常化的自然及必要步驟。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目之透明度，自1998年10月起，已從外匯基金資產中劃出特定部分，用以支持貨幣基礎。2015年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3至107.5%之間，未觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收市為106.3%（圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度），雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用作支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元兌美元匯率。基金龐大的財政資源在面對突發性衝擊時，可提供強大的後盾，以保障香港的金融穩定。\n\n圖5 2015年每日支持比率變動情況\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣發行委員會監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，該小組考慮的議題包括全球銀行提供國際美元貸款的情況、宏觀審慎監管措施的國際應用、美國利率上升對香港物業市場的影響、基本利率的釐定公式、香港貨幣實質有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權信貸違約風險。該小組討論的記錄及提交給該小組的貨幣發行局運作報告，均會在金管局網站上公布。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續資助有關貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究。2015年，該中心接待了16位研究 fellows，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議及研討會。主要的包括：\n\n* 第六屆中國經濟年度國際研討會於一月舉行，主題為「財務槓桿與金融體系效率及穩定：中國及國際經驗」。研討會發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋中國企業財務槓桿、中國信貸增長與經濟周期、銀行業競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行業監管與信貸供應等廣泛議題。\n* 五月舉行由香港金融研究中心與香港大學合辦的「研究中心與香港大學金融、機構及經濟增長聯合研討會」。研討會探討多個經濟議題，包括銀行業與貨幣政策、國際金融與跨境併購、金融規例的設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n* 十月由香港金融研究中心、聯邦儲備局、歐洲中央銀行及達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦題為「路向分歧的貨幣政策、環球資金流向及金融穩定」的研討會。研討會探討廣泛議題，包括貨幣政策與國際資金流動及匯率的關係、貨幣政策分歧及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界各地的溢出效應，以及全球貨幣政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該機構亦於八月舉辦了第十三屆 HKIMR 年度夏季研討會，並於九月舉行了第十三屆 HKIMR 中國內地經濟研討會，探討中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。這些研討會及研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務界及全球中央銀行的參與者。此外，該機構全年舉辦了24場公開小型研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n2015年底，流通中的紙幣總價值為港幣3602億元，較上年增加5.3%（圖表6、7及8）。流通中的政府發行紙幣及硬幣總價值為港幣112億元，較上年上升2.9%（圖表9及10）。流通中的政府發行港幣10元紙幣價值為港幣40億元，其中85%為塑質鈔票。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","terms":{"\"too big to fail\"

銀行體系的穩定\n\n金管局將監管重點放在認可機構的風險管治上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的管控措施，以及投資與保險產品的銷售手法。面對系統性風險的積聚，金管局於2016年1月1日起實施香港的逆周期緩衝資本0.625%（並於2017年1月1日起提高至1.25%）。五間認可機構被指定為具本地系統重要性銀行，將適用較高吸收虧損能力的資本緩衝。在引入金融機構（處置機制）條例草案至立法會的同時，有關復原及處置的改革亦取得重大進展。金管局亦加強與銀行業合作，提升對基本銀行服務的接觸、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融業從業員的技能和知識發展。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 總覽\n\n面對主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的跡象，2015年新興市場面臨資本外流風險上升及經濟增長放緩的壓力。為維持銀行體系在宏觀經濟環境出現可能急劇惡化情況下所具備的韌性，金管局持續密切監察認可機構（AIs）的風險管治成效及其信貸及流動性風險管理系統。\n\n# 監管工作\n\n2015年，金管局繼續採用監管方法，即定期進行現場審查，並配合較多的專題評估。專題評估屬非現場審查，專注於特定風險領域或某些選定認可機構的特定業務活動。此方法使金管局得以優化其監管資源，專注於認可機構所面臨的較為重要及新興風險。\n\n本年度，金管局共進行了193次現場審查。為應對認可機構貸款組合資產質素出現惡化跡象，金管局進行了針對信用風險管理及資產質素的更深入專題現場審查。考慮到主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分化所引致的市場不確定性，金管局亦增加了與財資相關業務有關的審查次數。此外，亦進行了與中國內地相關業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、業務操作及科技風險管理、資本規劃、打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動（AML\/CFT）管控措施，以及認可機構的內部評級基準（IRB）模式有關的現場審查。本年度，專門團隊亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務方面的活動進行了現場審查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項專題非現場審查，涵蓋與專題現場審查相同之領域。表1載明了監管工作之細節。\n\n2015年，共進行了196次非現場審查，以評估認可機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管重點放在風險管治、資本規劃、企業部門信貸及監察巴塞爾三號標準的落實情況。監管團隊與部分認可機構的董事局及外聘核數師保持頻繁聯繫。與認可機構的高級管理層及外聘核數師舉行了20次三方聯席會議，並與部分認可機構的董事局或董事會層級委員會舉行了23次會議。\n\n銀行業監管檢討委員會審視了四宗案件，全部涉及認可機構的授權事宜。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以應對競爭性優先事項，金管局繼續根據《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求認可機構委任外聘核數師跟進可能具有重大監管影響的事項。2015年，金管局根據此條款委託進行了六份報告。其中兩份報告涉及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的管控措施，另外兩份報告涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則與證券相關活動及貸款分類制度等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行體系的穩定\n\n2015年，沒有任何AI違反銀行條例有關資本充足比率或流動性比率的規定。根據條例各項條文共有84宗違規情況，但這些情況均未影響存款人的利益，且已由認可機構迅速處理。\n\n表1 監管工作\n\n# 第52條銀行條例所賦予的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc 仍受《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力所規管。2008年6月25日，金融管理專員根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條向Melli Bank Plc 香港分行就其業務、營業及財產所作出的指示，在本財政年度內仍然有效。金管局會繼續與相關當局保持定期溝通，以監察該分行及其英國總行的發展情況，並留意已採取的監管措施，以保護AI存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評級審查\n\nCAMEL核准委員會審查並確定認可機構的綜合CAMEL評級。認可機構已知悉該評級，並獲有請求複核的機會。本年度內無任何機構提出複核請求。\n\n# 專門監督工作\n\n# 運營及科技風險的監督\n\n金管局繼續根據新興風險及行業發展情況，發佈有關業務操作及科技風險管理的新指引或更新指引。特別是，金管局已完成對監管政策手冊（SPM）中有關電子銀行（e-banking）模塊的修訂，使認可機構在提供新電子銀行服務時更具靈活性。此外，金管局亦發佈有關網絡保安的通函，重申認可機構的董事及管理層須對有效的網絡保安風險管理進行監督。金管局亦定期發佈其「操作事故通訊」，重點介紹所選 fraud 案例或操作事故的作案手法，以及所識別的控制弱點。\n\n金管局推行以風險為基礎的主題性現場及非現場監察審查，評估選定認可機構在企業層面或特定業務線的業務運作及科技風險管理情況。這些審查涵蓋與認可機構業務運作風險管理架構、網絡保安風險管理、防止違規交易活動的管控措施、對重要外判服務供應商的監督、詐騙風險管理及反洗錢的科技管控等相關領域。這些監察審查亦由年度獨立合規評估補充，內容包括業務運作風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續運作規劃，選定認可機構須委任獨立且具資格的評估者，審查其相關管控措施的充足性，並修正所識別的弱點。金管局亦識別及分析認可機構業務運作及科技風險的趨勢及主要監管重點，特別針對在維護香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定及有效運作方面發揮重要作用的認可機構。\n\n金管局監察了銀行業實施晶片式自動櫃員機技術的最後階段，該技術使認可機構在2015年底前完成了純信用卡的換卡程序。金管局亦要求發卡認可機構實施認證管控措施，以進一步提升「無卡支付」信用卡交易的安全性。另外，接獲報告指部分非接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可被隱蔽地訪問後，金管局要求有關認可機構採取迅速行動，通知並保護受影響的持卡人。金管局亦投放資源進行宣傳及解釋事件的規模及影響，以回應公眾關注，並監察認可機構的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響的卡片。\n\n金管局與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦有關電子銀行安全預防措施的公眾意識提升計劃、建立一個分享網絡保安情報的平台，以及為香港金融服務界業務持續管理協會舉辦的危機管理演習提供支援及意見，該演習涉及認可機構及其他金融機構。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n金管局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就指導及監督認可機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供協助。金管局透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構議會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議覆蓋涉及不同金融服務界領域內具有緊密業務關係的金融機構或受規管實體的各項議題，以確保監管行動更具協調性和有效性。\n\n本年度，金管局進行了25次現場及非現場主題審查及15次非現場監察認可機構。這些審查涵蓋了投資產品的銷售、證券交易的結算處理及客戶證券的安全保管，以及非投資相連長期保險（非投連長險）產品及與強制性公積金（強積金）相關產品的銷售，涉及零售、私人銀行業及企業銀行業客戶。\n\n八月，金管局向認可機構發出 circular，就向客戶銷售非投連長險產品時的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助認可機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行體系的穩定\n\n金管局繼續與財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）緊密合作，推動2014年保險公司（修訂）條例草案的立法程序，以設立獨立保險業監管局及為保險中介人建立法定發牌制度。七月，立法會通過了2015年保險公司（修訂）條例，其中規定金管局透過授權，就認可機構的保險中介業務行使查察及調查權力。\n\n金管局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗由RIs提出的從事附加受規管活動的申請。金管局批准了204名負責監督RIs證券業務的主管人員的申請，並對由RIs提交以納入金管局維護登記冊的9,697名人士進行背景審查。\n\n# 財資活動監督\n\n認可機構的流動性風險管理一直為金管局的重點監管關注事項，尤其在考慮到美國利率預期將正常化，以及隨後可能出現的資金流向逆轉，這可能會對認可機構的流動性狀況造成影響。2015年全年，金管局持續實施針對認可機構的加強版穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金支持其貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起實施《巴塞爾協定三》流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）後，金管局一直監測第1類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構的LCR通常維持在100%或以上，遠高於2015年在過渡期安排下法定最低標準60%。\n\n另外，金管局就選定的認可機構的控制框架進行專題現場審查，以管理與預期利率正常化相關的風險。在市場波動期間，金管局亦密切關注市場的急劇變化及其對銀行體系及個別認可機構的影響，並採取適當的後續行動。\n\n# 監管機構主導的壓力測試計劃\n\n金管局繼續推行由下而上的壓力測試計劃，以更好地了解在極端及不利經濟情況下，本地註冊的零售銀行的抗風險能力，並鼓勵它們制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的計劃。本年度為收集更細緻的資料，以更深入地了解特定領域的風險動態，已推行多項改進措施。金管局分析了參與機構提交的結果，並與它們討論如何進一步改善其壓力測試程序。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產質素\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n近年來觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已趨緩。全年來看，銀行體系總貸款額增長3.5%，較2014年的12.7%明顯減緩（見表2）。由於客戶存款增長速度高於銀行貸款，整體貸存比率從去年同期的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，呼籲加強國際間的合作與溝通以維持穩定。當年，金管局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基建、優化監管與稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化，進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港強健的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現繼續獲信貸評級機構認可，標準普爾亦維持對香港的最高評級AAA評級。\n\n# 總覽\n\n金管局積極參與有關全球與區內金融穩定重要議題的國際討論。今年七月，金管局擔任亞洲地區金融穩定理事會諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）的共同主席一職，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定理事會成員與非成員之間的政策交流，鼓勵落實金融改革措施，並促進就金融穩定議題交換意見。金管局繼續與東盟+3當局緊密合作，加強東盟+3宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作——該辦公室已升格為國際組織——以監察及分析區域經濟情況，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n本年，香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行因多項市場因素而出現一定程度的收縮。然而市場仍能有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯成交額持續穩步增長。此外，香港進行的人民幣業務不斷擴張，亦有助於人民幣被國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）認可為可自由使用貨幣。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子的決定，將有助推動人民幣國際化，以及進一步發展香港的離岸市場。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及高效運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢方面發揮重要作用。2015年，香港人民幣支付系統的交易額創下新高，同時場外衍生工具交易資料儲存庫繼續支持機構根據於今年7月推出的新的場外衍生工具市場監管制度，按規定報告其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金融基建於2015年透過金管局引入新元素及服務進一步提升，其中包括於12月成功推出電子支票服務，意味著目前已有超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及流動渠道為客戶接收及處理電子支票。電子帳單及繳費服務（EBPP）於2013年推出後，2015年繼續見證商戶參與度的增長。7月，債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）在其基金訂單路由服務下推出服務，以支持內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）的落實。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦於11月隨著支付系統及儲值支付工具條例（PSSVFO）的生效而得到改善。根據PSSVFO，金管局有權為多用途儲值支付工具實施強制發牌制度，並履行相關的監管和執法工作，同時指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全有效地運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場之間的聯繫不斷加強，金管局積極透過國際及區域論壇，包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際結算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），與其他司法管轄區合作，推動可持續的經濟增長及金融體系穩定。金管局亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團的建議，以協助加強全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n金管局於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）RCG(A)的共同主席，並於十月在香港主辦第九次會議。RCG(A)為FSB成員及非成員提供一個重要的溝通與合作平台，以處理金融穩定相關事宜。來自16個亞洲地區財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高級代表出席會議，討論該地區所面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險計劃的經驗。金管局亦於八月在香港共同主辦有關宏觀審慎政策的研討會，該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）主辦，並邀請來自世界各地18個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了有關宏觀審慎政策的經驗，重點探討工具的校準與評估、其與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能產生的溢出效應。金管局亦與英格蘭銀行及國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）共同舉辦會議，探討中央銀行及其他政策制定者在選擇貨幣政策、宏觀審慎政策及微觀審慎政策的最佳組合時所面對的挑戰。會議吸引了逾百名參與者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融組織的代表。\n\n# 推動亞洲的貨幣與金融穩定\n\n金管局繼續履行其對促進亞洲金融穩定及在國際金融事務中發揚地區集體聲音的區域合作倡議的承諾。作為東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議（EMEAP）下設的貨幣及金融穩定委員會的宏觀監察工作協調人，金管局持續準備委員會的半年度宏觀監察報告，以評估地區的風險與脆弱性以及相關政策含義。作為EMEAP支付及結算系統工作小組主席，金管局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準與最佳實踐，以及國內及跨境支付結算系統發展方面的經驗分享與資訊交流。金管局亦領導小組內專責跨境合作與發展的子小組。金管局於六月在香港主辦EMEAP與國際結算銀行外匯市場小組及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議，與來自地區內17個機構及主要經濟體的代表出席，會議審視了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革情況。\n\n去年香港與東盟+3當局簽署AMRO協議後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在加強版清邁倡議多邊化下的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信貸評級\n\n金管局繼續與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密溝通，以全面評估香港的經濟表現及財政實力。這些努力促成了2015年所有主要信貸評級機構對香港信貸評級的確認。標準普爾確認香港獲得其最高的AAA評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體的超常增長前景、規模龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現以及強勁的淨外資產地位。穆迪及惠譽亦分別維持香港的評級於Aa1及AA+，僅低於三A級一級。\n\n# 香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港人民幣池產生影響。年底時，人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額達人民幣1,010億元，較去年同期人民幣1,158億元有所減少（圖1）。由於在岸市場利率下降，離岸人民幣債券發行有所減緩。因此，香港發行的人民幣債券減少至人民幣750億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增加9%，達人民幣6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款餘額亦較去年同期增加58%，達人民幣297億元（圖2）。人民幣即時支付結算（RTGS）系統的每日平均成交額增至人民幣947億元，較2014年上升29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步增長，根據調查結果，2015年4月底的每日成交額約為93億美元，較2013年4月進行上一次國際結算銀行每三年一度調查時增加88%。香港繼續為最大的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場深度與廣度均相當顯著。另一項加強此地位的重要發展是2015年7月實施內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）計劃，進一步拓展香港的人民幣產品範疇。\n\n金管局推動擴展跨境人民幣資金流向渠道的政策舉措，以及與業界合作加強香港人民幣金融平台的行動，持續取得成效。六月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣業務清算行及參加行將被允許在在岸銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並可將相關資金匯出境外，以協助離岸市場銀行進行人民幣流動性管理。九月，PBoC放寬跨境人民幣資金池業務的規則，使更多跨國企業可在簡化流程下進行集團內部人民幣調度。內地當局亦於七月為境外中央銀行、國際金融組織及主權財富基金提供更廣泛的在岸銀行間債券市場准入權。他們更於九月進一步開放內地外匯市場，讓這些機構參與其中。\n\n2016年10月1日起，國際貨幣基金組織宣布將人民幣納入特別提款權貨幣籃子。此決定肯定人民幣作為可自由使用貨幣的地位，並進一步提升人民幣在全球交易中使用的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化及內地與全球經濟金融體系更緊密聯繫所產生的新業務機會中受惠。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他地區在人民幣業務方面的合作。金管局與澳洲共同主辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同主辦第五屆人民幣業務合作小組，並與馬來西亞及泰國第二次合作舉辦有關人民幣業務的私營機構磋商。透過這些舉措，香港銀行加強了與其他市場在人民幣業務方面的流通及聯繫，這將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。金管局亦加強推廣努力，透過參與在香港及海外市場（包括加拿大、日本及非洲）舉辦的行業活動，促進企業及機構在貿易、投資及融資方面更廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n金管局副總裁黃偉綸於2015年12月11日第五屆香港–倫敦人民幣論壇期間舉辦的研討會上發言。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n2014年11月，在內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排（CEPA）框架下，內地與香港簽署了一項新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將廣東於2014年推出的大部分試點自由化措施擴展至全國範圍。透過給予香港銀行國民待遇，新協議預期將為這些銀行在內地從事業務時提供更多的政策確定性及更大的靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n金管局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行業監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。除有關中央銀行及一般風險管理的課程外，還包括消費者保障、信貸參考、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健指標分析及系統性風險監察等主題。同時亦為來自海外銀行及法規執行機構的代表舉辦臨時培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n全年期間，金管局安排了八次機構發行政府債券招標，總額為204億港元。截至2015年底， outstanding機構債券總額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation

儲備管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是風雲變幻的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此困難的投資環境下，外匯基金在2015年的總投資回報率為-0.6%，但與主要市場指數及相類似投資基金相比，其虧損情況相對較輕微，這歸功於金管局過去數年所採取的一系列防禦性措施，這些措施已加強了外匯基金的抗風險能力。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》所訂明的主要目標，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯價。基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全，以協助香港保持國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長控制，並在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於其認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金設定了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保有資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候皆完全由高度流動的美元資產支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 依(a)至(c)之條件，以達成有助於維持基金長期購買力之投資回報率。\n\n這些目標已全面考慮外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產分布。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金擁有兩個主要組合 — 支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有高度流動的美元資產，以根據貨幣發行局制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股市，以維持資產價值及長遠購買力。兩個組合整體的長期目標債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，81%的資產配置於美元及港元，其餘19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並在中長遠提升回報，金管局已以謹慎及逐步的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券與股票、私募股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。金管局在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計為1,421億港元，其中私募股權為913億港元，房地產投資為508億港元，尚未提取的投資承諾總額為1,224億港元。\n\n於2007年設立的策略性資產組合，用以持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由政府為外匯基金的戰略目的而購入，由於此資產組合的獨特性，因此不包括在評估外匯基金的投資表現之內。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序是以兩種類型的資產分布決定為基礎 —— 戰略性資產分布及戰略性偏離。戰略性資產分布反映在投資基準上，代表根據外匯基金的投資目標所制定的長期最佳資產分布。在戰略性資產分布的指導下，資產會進行戰略性分配，以期取得超越投資基準的回報。這通常意味著實際的資產分布與投資基準或戰略性資產分布有所不同。實際資產分布與投資基準之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然投資基準及戰略性偏離的上限是由財政司在與外匯基金諮詢委員會諮詢後所決定，但戰略性決策則由金管局在授權下作出。在戰略性偏離的上限範圍內，投資組合經理可根據短期市場變動採取投資立場。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部的員工直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，其中包括整個支持組合及投資組合的一部分。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球定息市場的一組組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的多種衍生工具組合。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除內部管理資產外，金管局亦聘請駐於多個國際金融中心的外聘投資經理，管理約24%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。委任外部經理的目的是利用市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以捕捉多樣化的投資風格，並將市場的知識及資訊轉移至內部專業人員。\n\n與外聘投資經理相關的支出包括基金管理、托管費、交易費以及扣繳及其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，且可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性突顯了風險管理的重要性。對於內部及外聘投資經理管理的投資組合，已建立嚴格的管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規則的遵守情況。風險管控工具被用來評估在正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以充分發揮內部及外聘投資經理的投資技巧。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年，全球金融市場波動極大。其中，股市尤為明顯，面臨異常的波動。年初上半年，主要股市創下新高。然而，市場情緒在第三季度急劇惡化，主因是對中國內地經濟增長的擔憂，導致主要股市回吐年初以來的漲幅，並出現顯著的季度跌幅。隨後，隨著市場情緒有所改善，全球股市亦有所復甦，但到了年底又再度走弱。由於與中國內地經濟密切聯繫，香港股票在2015年表現劣於其他主要股市。\n\n在政府債市方面，儘管市場預期美國利率正常化以及加息周期的開始，2015年較長週期的國庫券收益率仍小幅上升，因正面情緒受到全球經濟增長擔憂、持續存在的全球低通脹壓力以及升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢所抑制。另一方面，短週期的歐洲政府債券收益率則下跌，部分甚至跌入負值領域，這主要是由於歐洲中央銀行採取了積極的貨幣寬鬆政策。\n\n在貨幣市場方面，2015年美元持續走強，美元匯價指數上漲近10%，預期美國將啟動政策利率正常化周期。另一方面，歐元在第一季顯著走弱，創下自1999年歐元推出以來單季最大跌幅，原因是歐洲中央銀行於1月宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。相較之下，日圓在2015年對美元基本維持持平。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券及股市的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n面對極其波動的金融市場及困難的投資環境，外匯基金於2015年錄得投資虧損達158億港元，其中包括海外股票產生的收益71億港元、香港股票產生的虧損50億港元、債券產生的收益159億港元、非港元資產因貨幣兌換造成的負面影響449億港元，以及投資控股附屬公司所持其他投資產生的收益111億港元。由於去年美元大幅升值，將外匯基金的非美元投資轉換為港元時，產生負面貨幣兌換影響屬不可避免。另外，策略性資產組合錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n外匯基金的總資產在2015年底達 HK$3,4229 億。外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2015年的投資回報率為 -0.6%。然而，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及投資基金界整體相比，外匯基金的虧損可視為輕微。預見投資環境惡化，金管局在過去幾年已採取一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化步伐，特別是透過長期增長組合下的投資。這些措施已增強外匯基金的抗風險能力，並有助減輕一些潛在虧損。\n\n1994年至2015年間基金的年度回報率請參見圖表1。表2顯示2015年的投資回報率，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報率。過去三年的平均回報率為1.2%，過去五年的平均回報率為1.8%，過去十年的平均回報率為3.3%，自1994年起的平均回報率為5.0%。表3顯示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組成。\n\n圖表

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring organisation logo":["10年Plus同心展關懷標誌"],"2015 article iV Consultation":["2015

機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳媒、公眾教育活動及其他各種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，金管局透過支持員工專業發展、推行嚴謹的財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安及重新調整管理層職責，改善公司治理，以協助應對因實施新 programme 及系統而產生的挑戰，以及工作日益複雜的情況。\n\n# 參與社區企業發展\n\n# 傳媒關係\n\n金管局與傳媒保持緊密合作，以提高透明度，並促進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。2015年，共舉行了59項公開傳媒活動，包括14場新聞發布會、14場即場訪問及31項其他公開活動。此外，亦安排了43場傳媒訪問，發出325份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n此外，為加強公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，分別舉辦兩場媒體參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL），展示香港世界級的印鈔技術及金融基建。並舉辦有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的研討會，為媒體提供更深入的簡介，以加強對這些重要議題的了解。\n\n金管局總裁陳國強（中）及助理總裁（貨幣管理）李永強（右）於媒體訪問香港印鈔有限公司期間，檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n媒體巡禮期間舉行的自動化支票分類示範活動。照片中間（由左至右）為金管局行政總裁陳柏光先生；助理總裁（金融基建）李永昌先生；以及香港銀行同業結算有限公司行政總裁唐慧珊女士。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為大眾提供一個有效途徑，以獲取金管局的資訊，讓他們更深入了解該機構的主要職能。2015年，該服務共處理了9,078宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢涉及銀行業政策與規例、紙幣及硬幣，以及消費者銀行業相關問題。值得注意的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎監管措施、銀行產品及服務、打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動，以及硬幣收集計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年起接獲的公眾查詢數目，圖表2則提供2015年查詢類型的細項分析。\n\n圖表 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除金管局年度報告外，金管局過去一年發佈了兩期貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告、四期季報，並定期發佈金融數據月報，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行業及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，金管局管理層亦發表了14篇匯思文章，涵蓋各類具時效性和主題性的政策議題。\n\n2014 年金管局年報在 2015 年香港管理專業協會最佳年報評選的「非營利及慈善機構」組別中獲得了銅獎。\n\n# 金管局網站\n\n金管局的機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）以英文及繁體和簡體中文提供超過五萬頁的資料，是公眾獲取有關金管局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊及認可機構及本地代表辦事處紀錄冊，兩者均根據銀行業條例第20條設立及維護。隨著支付系統及儲值支付工具條例的實施，網站將會載有根據該條例設立的儲值支付工具持牌人紀錄冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以引起公眾對一些重要及時資訊的關注，例如提醒公眾需提高警覺以防止假冒電話詐騙，以及硬幣收集計劃中收銀車的分布位置等資訊。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n位於國際金融中心2期55樓的金管局資訊中心是向公眾介紹金管局工作及推廣貨幣及銀行業事務意識的重要資源。中心設有展覽館及圖書館，並於週一至週六開放公眾使用。展覽館介紹金管局的工作以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，內設有有關香港貨幣、銀行業和金融事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n資訊中心為訪客安排導覽服務。全年來訪人數超過48,300人，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導覽活動（圖表3）。自2003年12月資訊中心開幕以來，已有超過530,400人前來參觀。\n\n圖書館位於展覽館旁，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，用以深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行業和金融事務及中央銀行事務。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條，維護香港的認可機構電子登記冊。\n\n在持續推動社區接觸計劃的同時，金管局繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，共有約2,300名中學生及教師參與了三場講座。主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用以及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，已有超過54,700人參與了此計劃。\n\n圖表 3 訪問資訊中心的團體訪問類型\n\n年輕的訪客在導覽員帶領下參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n中學學生及教師參與公開教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n金管局招募、培訓及維持一支高度專業化的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對工作優先事項的變化。雖然金管局是政府的一部分，但它能以與公務員不同的條件僱用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一個公共機構，金管局旨在維持一個精簡而靈活的組織結構，並重新配置員工資源，以推行新舉措及應對工作量的增加。\n\n# 組織架構變動\n\n支付系統及儲值支付工具條例於2015年12月頒佈後，金管局設立了零售支付系統監管處，隸屬於貨幣管理部（MMD），以履行金管局在儲值支付工具及其他零售支付系統的牌照事務及日常監管方面的新法定職能。為加強部門之間的協作，並重新優化人力資源以應對新措施實施所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量和工作複雜性，金管局於2015年計劃進行部門職務重組，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基建部（FID）接掌了法規部（ENFD）及貨幣處（MMD）所負責的存款保障計劃的管理及結算功能。此外，亦從銀行部門接過與銀行業相關的若干工作，包括消費者教育、董事培訓及銀行從業人員的優化專業架構；\n\n外事部接過MMD的市場發展職能，而後者將繼續處理與財資市場公會及金融基準相關的工作；\n\n法規部從銀行業監管局接辦了打擊清洗黑錢及金融罪行處，並更名為法規及打擊清洗黑錢部。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n# 人力配置\n\n2015年金管局的設立數目為841名，2016年增加34名至875名（增加4%），以確保有足夠資源應對（i）新法例及措施的落實，（ii）持續進行的必要試行項目，以及（iii）現有工作的日益複雜性和工作量。新職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n加強銀行及金融體系穩定，包括：\n\n加強銀行業監督工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場審查、實施國際銀行標準及同業評審。\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡保安風險管理的監督；\n\n實施有關透過銀行及核准貨幣經紀進行的場外衍生工具之監管制度，並根據新生效之場外衍生工具匯報及備存紀錄規則執行。\n\n加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的監管及執法工作；\n\n積極籌備及進行實施《金融機構（處置機制）條例草案》的相關規劃工作，以國際標準應對金融業「太大而不能倒」的問題；\n\n透過發展針對銀行獨立非執董的專業能力計劃，以推動銀行體系的能力建構，進一步提升銀行治理水平，並與業界合作，促進從事銀行核心業務領域的銀行從業人員的專業能力框架提升。\n\n加強新銀行業、證券及保險產品的銀行操守政策與研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保障及消費者教育工作；並\n\n加強監測及分析人民幣在岸市場及離岸市場的動態，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對與建立未來基金相關的擴大投資活動以及外匯基金投資產品進一步多元化所帶來的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並在投資環境日益嚴峻的情況下，提升戰略資產分布及投資流程。\n\n實施新法定監管制度，使金管局能根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例規管儲值支付工具及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 機構職能\n\n臨時人手會調配以應對其他工作需求。金管局會調派員工到其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融發展局，以協助與香港或金管局有利益關係的活動或政策計劃。部分員工會以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障委員會及財資市場公會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據管治委員會（GSC）的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件，並考慮現時市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬及公積金計劃，並附有極少實物福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及變動薪酬，變動薪酬可根據表現每年以一次性發放方式授予個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局員工的薪酬每年由財政司司長根據管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會所提出的建議進行審查，考慮管治委員會對香港金融管理局上一年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問機構進行的金融行業薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他相關因素。有時會根據個別表現優異員工的情況作出特別薪酬調整，以維持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n任何經批准的香港金融管理局（HKMA）固定薪酬年度調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工的表現發放予個別員工。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員須遵守變動薪酬制度，以加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。香港金融管理局助理總裁或以上級別的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，須根據管治委員會（GSC）的建議，由財政司司長（FS）批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬時並不在場。香港金融管理局部門主管或以下級別的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金融管理局總裁根據財政司司長的授權，在批准的總薪酬獎勵範圍內作出決定。\n"}

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","terms":{"\"too big to fail\" problem":["大至不能倒問題"],"10 years plus Caring

\n外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 審計署  \n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人確認已審計外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，載於第134至222頁，包括外匯基金及集團於2015年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該會計年度的收入支出賬目、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及會計政策摘要及其他解釋性資料。\n\n# 金融管理專員對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理專員負責根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條首席執行官的指示及香港財務報告準則，編製提供真實而公平視角的財務報表，並負責該專員認為為確保財務報表免受重大錯誤陳述影響（無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致）而必要的內部控制。\n\n# 會計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計工作，就這些財務報表發表意見。我根據香港特別行政區行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所發出的指示，以及審計署審計準則進行審計。這些準則要求我遵守道德規範，並制定及執行審計程序，以獲得合理保證，認為財務報表在重大錯誤陳述方面是公正的。\n\n審計包括執行程序以取得有關財務報表中金額及披露的審計憑證。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括評估財務報表中因詐欺或錯誤而產生的重大錯誤陳述的風險。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製能提供真實而公平視角的財務報表相關的內部控制，以便設計適合情況的審計程序，但並非用以表達對實體內部控制有效性意見。審計還包括評估金融管理專員所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及其作出的會計估計是否合理，同時評估財務報表的整體呈現是否恰當。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我出具審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n依我之見，財務報表符合香港財務報告準則，並在根據《外匯基金條例》第7條由行政長官作出的指示下適當編製，並能真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2015年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該財務狀況在該會計年度內的財務表現及現金流。\n\nDavid Sun\n審計署署長\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計署  \n26樓  \n移民大樓  \n

財務報表附註\n\n（金額以千萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長授權，以外匯基金（該基金）總監身份，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。該基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的匯價，並保持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性和完整性。\n\n本基金的資產被管理為四個組合：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。支持組合的資產完全與香港的貨幣基礎相匹配，根據香港的貨幣發行局制度。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股市。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區政府為本基金戰略目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。經營分部資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 2 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個總稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋，以及香港公認的會計準則。基金及其附屬公司（以下統稱為集團）採用的重大會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的及修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於當前會計期間首次生效或可供早期採用。附註三提供有關因首次採用這些發展而導致會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並說明這些變更對這些財務報表中所反映的當前及前會計期間集團而言是否相關。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以千萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務於附註16及17中說明。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為原值成本法，除非下列資產及負債按下列所述會計政策中所解釋的公允價值列示：\n\n交易用途的金融工具（參見附註 2.6.2.1）；指定以公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債（參見附註 2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（參見附註 2.6.2.5）；黃金（參見附註 2.11）；及投資物業（參見附註 2.12）。\n\n依香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需管理層作出影響政策應用及資產、負債、收入及開支所報告金額的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設是根據經驗及其他各項因素作出，並在當時情況下認為合理，其結果成為作出有關資產及負債攜帶價值判斷的基礎，而這些攜帶價值並非來自其他來源。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及其相關假設會持續進行審查。若修正僅影響當期，則會在該期間認列會計估計數字的修正；若修正同時影響當期及未來期間，則會在修正期間及其後的各期認列。\n\n附註18包含有關投資物業公平值估算所涉及的假設資訊。附註37包含有關金融工具公平值估算所涉及的假設資訊。除附註2.5所列舉的某些金融工具的計值外，集團在應用會計政策時並未涉及任何重大會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司是指由集團所控制的實體。集團控制某實體，是指集團因參與該實體而享有變動回報，或有權獲得變動回報，且能透過其對該實體的控制權影響這些回報。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質性權利（由集團及其他方所持有）。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以千萬港元為單位表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n對附屬公司的投資，自取得控制權之日起直至失去控制權之日止，均納入集團財務報表中。\n\n集團財務報表中，所有集團內的餘額、交易及現金流，以及因集團內交易而產生的未實現損益，均會完全抵銷。\n\n非控股權益代表附屬公司中不直接或間接歸屬於基金之權益，且集團與這些權益持有人並未就任何額外條款達成協議，該協議將導致集團整體對這些權益產生符合財務負債定義的契約義務。非控股權益在集團資產負債表中列示於權益項目內，並與歸屬於基金所有者之權益分開列示。集團在結果中的非控股權益在集團收支帳目及集團全面收益表中於表內列示，作為將當年度的利潤或虧損及總全面收益或虧損在非控股權益與基金所有者之間進行分配。\n\n基金之資產負債表中，其對附屬公司的投資以成本減去減值虧損後之淨額列示（參見附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 聯營公司與合營公司\n\n關聯實體係指集團透過其參與財務及營運政策決策之權力，對該實體之管理具有重大影響，但並無控制或共同控制權之實體。\n"}
