{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","zh":"# 行政長官聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟持續增長；通貨膨脹維持在低水平；美國聯邦儲備系統當年進行的三度利率調升以及資產負債表縮減，並未導致新興市場經濟體的資本外流或美元升值。在樂觀情緒的推動下，全球股市，包括三大美國股市指數，持續創新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲34%。恒生指數在2017年獲利近8,000點（或36%），並在2018年1月突破30,000點關卡，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境下充滿樂觀情緒，甚至有些興奮。然而，這種情況持續到今年年初二月，當最新數據顯示美國工資增幅高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市出現顯著回調。二月第二週，道瓊斯指數兩天內下跌逾1,000點，恆生指數在同一週亦下跌逾3,000點。美國10年期國債收益率一度攀升至2.95%。資金流動的迅速反轉顯示，市場創下歷史高點的估值並非建立在穩固基礎之上。這也提醒我們，香港必須擁有健全而強韌的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動及資金外流所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 預防性措施提升銀行體系韌性\n\n有句諺語說：「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局於2017年實施進一步的風險緩釋措施，以維護香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。5月，我們推出第八輪逆周期措施，針對銀行的按揭貸款，並加強銀行對物業發展商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在提高銀行體系對物業市場任何下行風險的抗壓能力。透過多輪措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比，已從2009年9月的64%降至2017年底的49%；平均償還比率亦由2010年8月的41%降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被視為「太大而無法倒閉」的不可持續金融機構的解決方案。這有助於防止類似2008年全球金融危機的重演，當時政府動用公共資金拯救陷入困境的金融機構，並能最大限度地減少這些機構關閉對金融體系、經濟及整個社會的影響。\n\n強健的風險管理是銀行業穩健及可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率均遠高於適用的法定要求，並在全球範圍內名列前茅。這無疑反映出香港銀行體系具備高度的韌性。事實上，2017年銀行業實現強勁增長，總貸款額增加16%，同時資產質素亦維持良好。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年起的長期平均值2.2%。2017年銀行業整體的股本回報率（以稅前營運利潤計算）達11.74%，與其他國際金融中心相比，處於非常健康的水平。\n\n# 儲存聲音是長期財務穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年的全球金融危機顯示，單純依賴規則與法規來約束金融業追求獲利而忽視其主要責任，是有其局限性的。基於此，香港金融管理局近年來加強推動「健全銀行業」的實踐，鼓勵銀行發展並追求良好的企業文化與價值觀。特別是為解決銀行員工為追求短期利潤而損害客戶或銀行長期利益的問題，我們正鼓勵銀行建立與其企業文化與價值觀相符的適當激勵制度。作為此項行動的一部分，我們於2017年3月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事年會，以強調建立良好銀行文化的重 importance，並賦予獨立非執行董事更有效地履行監督與監察職責的權力。\n\n在銀行業界的支援下，2017年為香港金融管理局推動金融包容發展帶來了成功的一年。六間實體銀行分行及三間流動銀行分行已在偏遠地區開始運作。香港銀行協會與電訊盈科及一家便利商店連鎖店合作，推出試點計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的商店內無需購物便可提取現金。香港郵政今年亦在主要位於離島及新界地區的七間郵政局設立為長者提供現金提取服務。有關開戶事宜，香港金融管理局去年設立了專門網頁及電郵帳戶，並配有專責團隊跟進與開設銀行戶口相關的公眾查詢或投訴。由於各相關持份者協同努力，個人及企業開戶的客戶體驗已出現顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來重大轉變\n\n在科技快速發展的時代，金融科技已逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在這不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須擁抱新興發展，並在金融科技的應用上追求創新。隨著智慧銀行的新時代到來，香港金融管理局於九月推出了七項倡議（詳見第106頁），促進銀行業對金融科技的採用，以提升銀行產品及服務的質素，為客戶帶來更好的體驗。雖然這些倡議彼此獨立，但卻相輔相成，將會成為香港支付及銀行服務未來格局的轉折點。客戶不僅將享有更便捷、高效及安全的支付及銀行服務，同時也會擁有更多選擇，並對自身的金融交易擁有更大的控制權。金融科技將成為銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，而邁入智慧銀行的新時代，將為銀行提供一個升級與轉型的絕佳機會。\n\n# 一帶一路與灣區發展藍圖所創造的龐大商機\n\n在全球性金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈的情況下，香港擁有多元化的金融產業至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。基於香港獨特的優勢——「背靠祖國，面向國際」，「一帶一路」倡議及廣東灣區（廣東-香港-澳門灣區）的發展，為香港的金融與銀行業帶來巨大的發展機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新的動力。為回應「一帶一路」倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自成立以來合作伙伴數量已增至約90個，為香港成為基礎設施投資融資中心奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，中國開發銀行在香港發行首隻「一帶一路」債券，凸顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面所扮演的重要角色。\n\n除基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極參與香港作為企業財務中心、私人股權基金及亞洲衍生產品業務樞紐的發展，透過吸引國際企業及主要金融機構在香港管理其資金、資產及各種財務風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固和提升香港的金融及相關專業服務業。香港金融管理局亦與負責灣區發展的相關當局保持密切溝通，加強合作，以促進該地區作為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直以「發揮香港優勢，配合國家需要」為主題持續發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年7月啟動債券通北向交易後，香港作為連接大陸與世界其他地區的金融平台，已將雙邊市場准入從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這進一步凸顯了香港作為金融中介的獨特角色，有助於全球投資者接觸大陸金融市場。2017年，香港繼續維持其作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。人民幣實時 gross 設結系統（RTGS）的日均成交額達人民幣9千億元。此外，根據SWIFT統計，全年全球人民幣支付交易中，超過70%是經由香港處理。離岸人民幣市場持續穩健運作並穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才，強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融行業持續發展，培養人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局（HKMA）非常重視銀行業的軟實力，並一直鼓勵及支持銀行從業人員持續專業發展。在引入反洗錢及反恐融資以及網絡安全兩個模塊的增強能力框架後，我們去年擴展了該框架的範疇，加入了零售財富管理及財務管理，以透過持續專業發展提升銀行從業人員的核心能力。香港金融管理局亦致力於培育銀行業的年輕人才。2017年，我們與業界合作推出了私人財富管理見習學徒計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。考慮到反應熱烈，這些計劃的覆蓋範圍將在未來進一步擴展。\n\n# 謹慎投資策略，於中長期實現合理且穩定的報酬\n\n在全球經濟強勁增長的背景下，去年香港發鈔銀行基金（Exchange Fund）實現了創紀錄的投資收入高達2640億港元，各類資產類別均有不錯表現，包括股票、債券及外匯。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率為12.1%，而後備組合則取得1.8%的回報。自2009年啟動以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部收益率已達到13.7%。雖然去年的投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續謹慎管理發鈔銀行基金。我們將保持靈活應變，密切監察市場動態，並在適當時候採取防禦性措施。長期增長組合（LTGP）的投資也會進一步擴大。一如往常，我們在管理香港市民財富時，將繼續遵循「資本保值為先，長期增長為後」的投資原則，並在可接受的風險範圍內落實此原則。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續去年的成長動能，2018年仍存在不少不確定性與風險。這些風險包括：若通脹上揚，美國利率調升速度可能高於預期；貿易摩擦升溫以及地緣政治形勢惡化。倘若這些下行風險實現，將對全球金融市場產生重大而廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟產生連鎖反應。因此，我們應謹慎管理相關風險。\n\n接下來幾個月，香港美元利率的變化仍將持續受到關注。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備系統已連續加息六次。隨著香港美元利率與美元利率之間的差距擴大，資金從香港美元流向美元的動機也變得更強。近期香港美元面臨貶值壓力，並已觸發7.85弱方保證（CU）。正如我們一再強調，當7.85弱方保證被觸發時，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將扮演「超級外匯經紀」的角色，透過在市場上買入香港美元並賣出美元，以確保香港美元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。這些操作屬正常範疇，符合聯繫匯率制度的設計。這一點不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，目前貨幣發行局持有的資產價值已超過4萬億港元，其中香港美元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，為應對資金外流提供了強大的緩衝空間。多年來，香港金融管理局已設立多層防線，以維護銀行及金融體系的穩定。從正面角度看，資金外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，這有助於香港利率環境的正常化，進而促進本地經濟與資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，香港金融管理局將保持警覺，並盡一切努力維持香港的貨幣與金融穩定。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟更趨同步擴張的背景下，香港在2017年實現了較快的經濟增長、較緊的勞動市場情況以及較低的通脹壓力。預計2018年的經濟增長將繼續保持強勁。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港經濟在2017年增長速度較快。實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長率提高至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%，也高於過去十年約3%的長期增長率（圖表1及表格1）。內在需求穩固，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出亦有所恢復。強勁的內在需求反映就業與收入條件改善、資產價格蓬勃發展以及企業信心提升。在外在方面，香港商品出口因全球貿易流量增加而擴張速度加快，服務出口則因貿易及貨運流量活躍以及入境旅遊改善而恢復增長。商品進口因出口帶動的需求而增長強勁，服務進口則因居民旅遊意願強勁而持續上升。總體而言，整體貿易順差縮小，對GDP增長產生負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n在貨幣方面，受香港美元與美國美元之間負利率差幅影響，主要由於利率套利活動，香港美元兌美元匯率整體有所回落。這反映了聯繫匯率制度按照設計正常運作。雖然香港美元銀行間利率仍處於相對低水平，但由於與首次公開發行相關的融資需求以及銀行年底流動性需求，2017年底該利率面臨較大的上漲壓力。在信貸增長方面，經過兩年單位數增長後，總銀行貸款在2017年以明顯更快的16.1%速度增長，反映經濟情況改善及金融市場情緒正面。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸發放標準並未出現放寬跡象，整體貸款質量仍保持良好。\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n2017年通脹壓力一直維持在可控範圍內（圖2）。扣除政府一次性纾困措施的影響後，基礎通脹率降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%有所下降。特別是，價格指數中的住宅部分增幅較為溫和，反映2016年新租賃私人住宅租金增幅放緩的影響逐漸滲透。更廣泛而言，在強勁生產力增長的背景下，名義工資和收入增幅較為溫和，有助於控制本地成本壓力。同時，進口物價通脹也相對平穩，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹情況一致，即使美元貶值也未見明顯影響。\n\n# 就業市場\n\n2017年，勞動市場因經濟成長優於預期而趨於緊繃。經過季節調整的失業率從2016年的3.4%下降至2017年底的2.9%，為近20年來首次低於3%（圖3）。主要經濟部門的失業率均有下降，其中零售、金融以及專業與商業服務業的降幅較為顯著。隨著總體就業人數成長速度加快，以及私人部門的職缺數量增加，整體勞動需求持續強化。勞動人口也有所擴張，部分反映年長者（55歲以上）參與勞動市場的意願提高。與勞動市場趨於緊繃及通貨膨脹率下降的情況一致，實質工資與所得的增幅也加快。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2017年香港股市幾乎沒有間斷地持續上漲。恆生指數上升了36%，這是自2010年以來最大的年度漲幅（圖4）。這波漲勢反映了對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並部分受益於內地投資者透過「港股通」大量資金流入。恆生指數在11月達到十年來的高點，並在2017年底維持在高水平。平均每日成交額從前一年的669億港元擴大至883億港元，而來自本地市場的總集資額也增至5814億港元，較一年前的4901億港元有所增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持上升動力（圖4）。2017年交易量由去年同期的54,701單位增至61,591單位，樓價上漲14.8%。樓宇負擔能力進一步惡化，價格收入比率達16.4，高於1997年的歷史高峰，收入負擔比率為74.1，遠高於長期平均值。1 面對樓價持續上升及銀行間按揭業務競爭加劇，香港金融管理局於5月推出第八輪審慎監管措施，以加強銀行風險管理及維護銀行體系穩定。這些措施使樓價增長一度放緩，但隨後在第四季再度加快。至於商業及工業物業市場，全年交易活動顯著增加，交易價值及成交量均實現雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格上漲，相應的租金回報率較上年略有下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2018年的經濟增長預期將保持強勁。政府預測增長幅度將在3至4%之間，而私人部門分析師則預期經濟將以平均3.2%的速率擴張。在外圍方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受益於改善的全球增長預期以及進口旅遊業的逐步復甦。在內在方面，私人消費增長預期將維持穩定，主要得益於有利的就業市場情況。至於固定資本形成，建築及建設活動應會穩步推進，這得益於住宅供應增加及持續的基礎設施項目。雖然改善的經濟情況將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升可能成為阻力。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在全球通脹仍屬溫和，本地成本持續上升的情況下，預計香港的通脹壓力在2018年將繼續保持溫和，但通脹率可能會從2017年的低點逐步回升。例如，由於新租賃私人住宅租金的上漲，通脹中的租金成分可能在2018年下半年加快上漲動力。市場共識預測，2018年的 headline 通脹率仍將維持溫和的2.2%，而政府預計基礎通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築及建設活動的擴張，以及入境旅遊逐步復甦，預計將在不久的將來維持勞動市場緊張的情況。私人機構分析師預測，2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%的水平。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2018年的經濟展望面臨若干不確定性和風險，包括主要央行貨幣政策正常化、全球金融市場穩定性，以及保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張關係惡化等問題。特別是，若這些風險實現並引發香港資金流動方向逆轉，本地貨幣條件可能比預期更快收緊，對實體經濟和資產價格造成下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍然不確定。在短期內，目前有利的國內經濟環境、被認為存在的住房短缺、低按揭利率以及替代性的住房融資來源（包括物業發展商提供的按揭貸款及來自父母的財務支援），將繼續支撐物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會影響市場情緒。從長遠來看，物業市場仍將面臨多項不利因素。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化的持續進行，國內按揭利率最終將上揚。此外，基於政府增加土地及住宅物業供應的努力，住房需求與供應的缺口預期將逐步收窄，這將在長遠上緩和物業價格上漲的壓力。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n2017年，香港銀行業在面對全球經濟不確定性的情況下，依然保持穩健。獲授權機構（AIs）的資本及流動性狀況持續強健，資產質素維持在健康水平，盈利能力亦因息差擴大及信貸增長強勁而明顯改善。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的一個月及三個月期固定利率分別上升了49個基點及39個基點。第四季的上漲情況更為顯著。然而，零售銀行的港元資金成本（以綜合利率衡量）全年大致保持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行在香港分行的總體稅前營業利潤在2017年增長了15.8%。表現改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）及手續費和佣金收入增加（+9.4%）。然而，這些增長部分被外匯及衍生產品業務收入下降（-29.9%）及營運費用增加（+8.4%）所抵消。零售銀行的總體稅後利潤因2016年記入的某些非經常性項目而下降了18.1%。零售銀行的稅後資產回報率由2016年的1.44%降至1.07%（圖表6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨利息 margin 在2017年擴大至1.45%，較2016年的1.32%有所上升（圖7），主要由於市場利率上漲。\n\n零售銀行的非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，從2016年的44.3%降至40%。雖然手續費及佣金收入增長了9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生產品業務的收入則下降了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的營運成本與營收比率由2016年的43.2%降至2017年的41.9%，因營運收入增長11.8%，而營運成本僅增長8.4%（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備由2016年的80億港元降至73億港元。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n零售銀行的貸款質素在本年度有所改善，分類貸款比率由去年同期的0.72%降至0.54%。逾期及重新安排貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣地，整個銀行業的分類貸款比率及逾期及重新安排貸款比率分別由0.85%和0.67%降至0.67%和0.52%。\n\n銀行的住宅按揭貸款組合質素保持良好，截至2017年底，違約率維持在低水平的0.03%（圖10）。重組貸款比率接近0%。與一年前相比，年底時沒有住宅按揭貸款出現負資產情況，而一年前則有四宗案例。\n\n2017年底信用卡貸款的違約率維持在低水平，為0.22%，較去年同期的0.24%略降（圖10）。同期內，逾期及重新安排貸款的合計比率微降至0.31%，從0.33%下降。核銷比率也略微下降，從2016年的1.92%降至1.75%。\n\n# 權責發生基礎的財務報表趨勢\n\n2017年銀行業總貸款額較2016年的增幅達16.1%，較之6.5%的增幅顯著提高。信貸需求增加，主要由於對全球經濟前景持樂觀態度。由於總存款增幅低於總貸款增幅，因此截至2017年底，整體貸款與存款比率上升至73%，較一年前的68.4%有所提高。同期，港元貸款與存款比率亦上升至82.7%，較77.1%有所增加（圖11）。\n\n與內地相關的貸款（包括本地註冊銀行在內地子公司的貸款）在2017年增長17.5%，較2016年的7%增幅有所提高。\n\n# 可交易債務證券持有量\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管對港元匯率的壓力有所減弱，港元匯率及貨幣市場仍持續有序運作，並擁有充足的流動性。聯繫匯率制度一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支點，並在面對各種衝擊時表現出高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。所謂貨幣穩定，是指香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎必須至少由匯基金所持有的美元儲備完全支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括以下項目：\n- 債券憑證，用以完全支持三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣\n- 政府發行並流通的紙幣和硬幣\n- 總結餘，即銀行在香港金融管理局（HKMA）開設的結算賬戶的結餘總和\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的貨幣發行基金票據及紙幣（EFBNs）。\n\n香港貨幣兌換率的穩定是透過自動利率調節機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾來維持的。當對港元的需求大於供應，市場兌換率上揚至強方兌換水平 HK$7.75 至 1 美元時，HKMA 會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此時總結餘將擴張，推動港元利率下降，創造出使港元兌換率離開強方上限、並維持在 7.75 至 7.85 的可兌換範圍內的貨幣條件。反之，若港元供應大於需求，市場兌換率下跌至弱方兌換水平 HK$7.85 至 1 美元時，HKMA 會從銀行購入港元。此時總結餘將收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元兌換率離開弱方上限，並維持在可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定性\n\n2017年，港元兌美元匯率整體面對較弱的壓力（圖1）。主要由於港元與美元利率之間負利差擴大，促使投資者進行利率套利交易，港元對美元逐步貶值，從1月3日的7.7566跌至8月22日的年低點7.8265。9月下旬至11月上旬，港元兌美元匯率一度有所反彈，這主要是因為與首次公開發行（IPO）相關的資金需求導致港元流動性收緊，匯率在7.80至7.81的窄幅範圍內穩步交易。到了年底，港元再次面對較弱的壓力，部分反映港元流動性條件略有改善，以及年底商業對美元的需求增加。整體而言，2017年港元兌美元匯市運作正常。\n\n由於信貸機構未被觸發，2017年（圖2）總結算餘額及未償還的發行債券餘額總計維持在約1,2253億港元，幾乎沒有變化。當年，香港金融管理局發行額外800億港元的發行債券，以應對銀行對流動性管理需求的增加。這導致總結算餘額在2017年底縮減至1798億港元。額外發行發行債券的舉措與貨幣發行局制度原則一致，因為這僅代表貨幣基礎組成部分的變化，即從總結算餘額轉移到未償還的發行債券。貨幣基礎仍然完全由外匯儲備所支持。\n\n# 財務市場\n\n2017年前八個月，香港美元銀行間利率維持偏軟，直至年底才面對較大的上調壓力（圖3）。儘管有對美國聯邦儲備系統加息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，香港美元銀行間利率在前八個月基本上仍維持偏軟。因此，香港美元與美元利率之間的負利差在1月至8月期間擴大。從9月起，短週期香港美元銀行間利率出現顯著上升，主要由IPO相關及年底融資需求所推動。相應地，香港美元與美元利率之間的負利差在短週期部分收窄。整體而言，2017年短週期銀行間利率大多數時間均低於基本利率。\n\n基準利率於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日分別上調，全年總計上調75個基點，由1.00%調升至1.75%。此調整係因美國聯邦基金目標利率範圍在本年內上調三次，總計上調75個基點，由0.50–0.75%調升至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整係依照2009年3月26日公布的修正公式進行，該公式規定基準利率設置為美國聯邦基金目標利率當前範圍下限之上50個基點，或香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的隔夜及一個月期利率五日移動平均數的平均值，取較高者。\n\n大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，港元期貨點數的折讓在首三個季度逐步擴大，12個月期港元期貨點數於9月中達到約-615點（圖4）。在第四季，港元期貨點數的折讓略有收窄，與港元與美元息差的負值收窄同步。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行間流動性仍屬充足。貼現窗口貸款額由2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要支柱，在一系列區域性和全球性金融危機中表現出高度的韌性。政府重申對聯繫匯率制度的堅定承諾，其承諾的可信度亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步加強。香港公眾對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存工具的信心亦持續強勁。在2017年對香港的第四條審查（Article IV consultation）中，國際貨幣基金組織重申對聯繫匯率制度的支持，並指出聯繫匯率制度仍是香港最適合的匯率安排。配合強大的金融監管與監督、謹慎的財政管理以及靈活的市場機制，聯繫匯率制度已有效協助香港成功應對內外各種挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯繫匯率制度仍是香港的最佳安排。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監察銀行對信貸風險、流動性風險及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業貸款、物業相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管工作，以增強銀行業的抗風險能力。隨著美國聯邦儲備系統持續調整貨幣政策，香港美元利率亦將逐步趨於正常化。香港金融管理局重申，在聯繫匯率制度的設計下，資金外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方保證金制度及貨幣基礎減少，都是港元利率正常化過程中的必要階段。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並做好應對潛在金融動蕩的準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中劃出特定部分，用以支持貨幣基礎。背書比率（即背書資產除以貨幣基礎）在2017年維持在106.7%至108.2%之間，未觸及上、下觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收市為108.1%（圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），雖然已指定特定發行基金資產用作背書組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在面對突發性衝擊時，發行基金龐大的財政資源將提供強大的後盾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港發鈔銀行委員會的貨幣發行委員會子委員會（CBC）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2017年，CBC考慮了多項議題，包括香港樓價短暫波動的動因、港元銀行同业拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同业拆息（LIBOR）利差的決定因素、物業估值變動對中國內地企業融資的影響，以及按揭貸款償還負擔對香港私人消費的影響。CBC就這些議題的討論記錄及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，均在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）持續贊助有關貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR已將其活動重點重新導向至更具政策相關性的方向。這尤其體現在其研討會活動及訪問 fellowship 計畫上。HKIMR與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦更多以政策為重點的研討會。同時，自2016年推出的主題研究 fellowship 計畫，已支持更多與香港金融管理局（HKMA）所關心的重要政策問題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了18位研究 fellows，並發表了29篇工作論文。該中心當年亦舉辦了四場國際會議及研討會：\n- 第八屆亞洲經濟國際會議，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：將往何處去？」，於1月在香港舉行。該會議為學者、政策制定者及企業經濟學家提供一個討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析及政策議題的平台。會議共發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革與國際外溢效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策架構與傳導機制等廣泛議題。\n- 香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）第十五屆夏季研討會於7月舉行。該研討會旨在為HKIMR及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的員工提供發表研究成果的機會，並促進研究人員與訪問 fellows 之間的交流互動。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）與國際清算銀行（BIS）聯合舉辦的主題為「匯率的價格、實質與金融影響」的會議於8月舉行。該會議為深入且有見地的討論提供了平台，涵蓋了匯率制度、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備積累過程中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為等重要議題。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）、美國聯邦儲備系統（Fed）及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行（Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta）共同贊助的主題為「非常規貨幣政策：所學經驗」的會議於10月舉行。該會議回顧了過去十年內主要央行所推行的非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗教訓，討論議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興市場的外溢影響、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟與金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續將監管重點放在獲授權機構風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施亦被引入，以加強銀行業對物業市場任何下行風險的抗風險能力。面對網絡威脅不斷上升，香港金融管理局亦加強對獲授權機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，香港金融管理局啟動了七項措施，為香港邁向智能銀行的新時代作準備。為加強對金融犯罪的打擊，香港金融管理局持續將獲授權機構反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施的有效性作為監管重點。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局進一步推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容，並解決中小企業及新興企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶時所遇到的困難。同時亦加強對投資及保險產品銷售行為的監管，以進一步加強對客戶的保護。\n\n在國際監管及會計準則的本地落實方面取得重大進展，包括資本充足準則、披露準則、淨穩定資金比例、大額 exposures 限制、回收計劃及國際財務報告準則第 9 號。為應對不斷變化的銀行環境及演變中的風險格局，香港金融管理局與業界協調，推行董事權限提升計劃及銀行從業人員增強能力架構。\n\n《金融機構（紓困）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨部門紓困機制的金融穩定委員會成員司法管轄區之一。該條例設立了一條新的防線，以維護金融穩定，並賦予貨幣管理局在金融機構出現可能造成系統性後果的失敗情況下，有序管理該失敗的必要權力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於金融體系具備高度的韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其營運方式，可能影響整個系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，更可能以混亂的方式導致系統失敗。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在確保銀行具備應對衝擊的能力、並能在危機中恢復其地位，從而維護金融穩定方面，發揮關鍵作用，這最終有助於防止系統失敗。貨幣管理局負責香港銀行業務的審慎監管，包括存款業務。其職責亦包括授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及存款機構，這些機構合稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。貨幣管理局亦負責某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監管。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保，亦無香港審慎監管框架旨在確保，一個零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為一個解決機構，旨在確保在人工智能機構（AI）出現故障的情況下，能以有序的方式進行解決，以維持人工智能機構向其客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港已建立一套金融機構的解決機制，其中貨幣管理局為人工智能機構及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監管活動概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了192次現場以外的審查，覆蓋範圍廣泛，包括資本充足率、公司治理、人工智能機構（AIs）的業務運作及風險管理等問題。為持續推動人工智能機構強化風險治理，HKMA與人工智能機構的董事會或董事層委員會舉行了30次會議，討論重點為重要的風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監測其最近有關公司治理指引的落實情況。此外，HKMA亦與人工智能機構及其外部會計師舉行了27次三方會議。\n\n除離場活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續進行定期的現場檢查，並配合針對高風險領域的主題審查。這種做法使HKMA得以優先配置監管資源，專注於人工智能機構（AIs）所面對的出現較新且較重要的風險。在本財政年度，HKMA進行了401次現場檢查及主題審查。信用風險管理及控制仍是這些檢查及審查的重點。另一個主要關注點是科技風險及運作風險管理。HKMA亦增加對流動性及市場風險管理以及反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制的現場檢查次數，並針對這些領域進行更多現場檢查及主題審查。此外，專門團隊亦對人工智能機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）相關業務的活動進行現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險管理\n\n# 貸款成長與資產品質\n\n總體銀行貸款額成長16.1%，較2016年的6.5%成長率顯著提高。如表2所示，貸款成長呈現廣泛分布。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款在2017年底增至4,188億港元，增幅為17.5%（見表3）。其中包含440億港元貸款，為香港註冊銀行的內地子公司所發放。\n\n2017年，AI的資產質量維持健康狀態。零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均水平2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，分類貸款比率從0.85%降至0.67%。至於與內地相關的貸款，零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2016年的0.82%降至2017年的0.75%。就整個銀行業而言，該比率從去年同期的0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n本年，香港金融管理局加強了對人工智能的監管工作，以確保人工智能持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是在監察人工智能對主要企業的風險敞口方面，監管力度有所加強。並進行了針對性的主題審查，重點關注貸款發放標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及針對物業發展商貸款、資產支持融資及保險 premiums 融資的風險管理等關鍵信貸風險管理控制措施。\n\n# 房屋抵押貸款\n\n2017年物價持續上升。有更多由銀行機構提供的貸款涉及擁有多項按揭貸款的借款人，或其收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人。考慮到這些發展，香港金融管理局於5月19日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高銀行機構計算新住宅按揭貸款資本要求時的風險權重基準、降低針對已有按揭貸款借款人的物業按揭貸款貸款價值比率（LTV）上限，以及降低針對收入主要來自香港以外地區借款人的物業按揭貸款償還比率（DSR）上限。\n\n自2009年起實施的香港金融管理局（HKMA）針對物業按揭貸款的宏觀審慎措施，已增強銀行對物業市場相關風險的抗風險能力。在首次引入逆周期措施之前，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%降至2017年12月的49%。平均債務服務比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%降至2017年12月的35%（圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局注意到，一些發展商以高槓桿率為其物業發展項目提供融資，並有部分發展商向物業買家提供高貸款價值比率（LTV）的按揭貸款。為應對這些發展項目所涉及的風險，香港金融管理局於5月12日推出新的風險管理措施，以規管向發展商提供貸款。這些措施包括要求發牌機構（AIs）降低建築融資的融資上限；要求發牌機構為其向發展商提供貸款設置更多資本，特別是當貸款與股本比例較高時；並進行一輪主題審查，以確保銀行在向發展商提供貸款時持續遵循謹慎的貸款審批標準。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於二月與土地註冊處合作啟動了一項電子通報服務。該電子通報服務在土地註冊處為抵押物辦理進一步抵押登記時，會向有關的自動貸款人發出通知，使抵押銀行能適時採取適當的風險緩釋措施。\n\n# 操作與科技風險的監督\n\n全年網絡安全威脅持續上升。香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強監管努力，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。根據香港金融管理局於2016年推行的網絡安全強化計劃（CFI），30間資深銀行已完成對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。此外，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）在與銀行及證券業廣泛磋商後， jointly 决定推行強制性的雙因素認證，以用於網上股票交易。同時，亦進行了一輪現場審查，專注於銀行的網絡安全控制措施及運營韌性。香港金融管理局進一步與主要銀行的高層管理人員進行一輪討論，評估銀行如何應對潛在新市場參與者因科技進步而帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布了一套措施，協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行的新時代。在監管方面，HKMA將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行及科技公司均可使用的聊天室設施，以及建立HKMA、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局（IA）沙盒之間的聯繫，以便進行跨行業金融科技產品的測試，提供一站式入口。\n\n香港金融管理局亦啟動了「銀行服務簡化」計劃，以識別及減低監管摩擦，進一步改善客戶使用金融科技及網上銀行服務的體驗。目前已設立專責小組，重點關注遠程開戶及帳戶管理、網上金融及網上資產管理等領域。\n\n有關現行虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討工作已展開，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 財務活動監督與流動性風險管理\n\n隨著美國持續正常化其貨幣政策，全球資金流動可能變得更加波動。考慮到此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在今年加強了對流動性風險的監管重點。HKMA 增強了對流動性風險的監管壓力測試，加入了更多情境，包括一個更具壓力但較為合理的資金流出情境，以及一個短暫且由信心驅動的銀行擠兌情境。HKMA 同時加強了對個別發行機構（AIs）流動性狀況的監測與分析，並要求部分 AIs 增強其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）就人工智能機構（AIs）的債務證券投資組合的市場風險管理，進行了更多現場審查。一輪主題性審查已進行，以評估人工智能機構在海外貨幣債券上的投資活動增加所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相應風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖做法。\n\n# 防範洗錢及恐怖主義融資（ML\/TF）\n\n2017年《反洗錢及反恐融資（機構）（修訂）條例》於6月23日刊憲，並於2018年生效。此次修訂旨在使香港的反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管制度與金融行動特別工作組（FATF）最新公布的國際標準保持一致。這些修訂與反洗錢及反恐融資法定指引的更新，有助於釐清及落實在開戶及維持真實客戶過程中的風險為本方法（CDD），並鼓勵在遠程進行這些程序時的創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力於提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新舉措旨在促進銀行及支付行業在金融科技的發展與應用，受到相關利益相關者及公眾的廣泛歡迎。由於在基礎設施投資融資_hub 方面進行了一系列網絡建設與能力建設工作，香港作為國際基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升。債券通的啟動進一步鞏固了香港作為通往內地投資機會主要門戶的地位。香港金融管理局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力也已見成效。\n\n# 總覽\n\n鑑於科技的快速發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布啟動七項舉措，以準備香港邁向智慧銀行的新時代。這些舉措包括：\n- 發展更快支付系統（FPS），以實現數碼零售支付的全面連通；\n- 引入開放應用程式程式設計介面（開放API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才培育；\n- 加強跨國界金融科技合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；\n- 推動虛擬銀行的引入；以及\n- 推廣「銀行服務簡化」新舉措，以減少顧客在數碼體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局銀行部共同發揮關鍵作用，推動落實這些措施，以加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的定位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際聲譽進一步提升，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作伙伴數目由成立時約40家增至2018年1月31日的87家。當年，IFFO舉辦及參與超過10場研討會及工作坊，促進關鍵利益相關方的經驗交流與合作網絡。特別是在其首屆債券融資及投資者圓桌會議中，IFFO推動制定基礎設施股權投資參考協議，以提升基礎設施項目的融資可行性及投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月啟動，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互聯互通邁出另一重要里程碑，並進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。本年度，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由人民幣2700億元增至人民幣5000億元。香港持續維持全球最大規模的人民幣離岸流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動活躍，這從我們人民幣實時全额結算（RTGS）系統的高交易量以及香港人民幣支付活動佔全球絕大部分可見一斑。\n\n自2016年引入企業財務中心（CTC）稅制後，香港金融管理局加強了推廣工作，以吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立財務中心。至2017年底，已有超過40間企業向香港金融管理局表示，他們正積極計劃或已經在香港設立財務中心業務。\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，就影響全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題提出意見。香港金融管理局總裁於四月擔任金融穩定委員會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導討論關鍵的金融穩定議題。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球人民幣離岸業務中心的角色奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四間銀行間實時清算系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）實現了100%系統可用性，高於目標的99.95%。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已與兩間內地中央證券登記結算機構（CSDs）設立帳戶，以便利債券通交易的結算，並代表相關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付行業的整體安全與效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於八月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定四個零售支付系統（RPSs），以將其運作納入HKMA的監管範疇。HKMA亦監督了16間儲值支付工具（SVF）發牌機構，這些機構積極推出新產品及服務，以提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。此外，e- cheque及電子發票展示及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，包括香港與廣東全省之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 亞洲的金融科技中心——香港\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n鑑於科技的快速發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布了七項舉措，以準備香港邁向智慧銀行的新時代。這些舉措旨在協助銀行業提升至更高水平，並把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n「智慧銀行將提供零售與企業客戶之間的全面互通性，並允許以高度的行動性、速度、便捷性與安全性進行金融服務與交易。」\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界及金融科技社群緊密合作，並在落實七項倡議方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\nFPS 是一個多幣種平台，讓公眾可透過手機號碼或電郵地址，以實時方式全天候輕鬆進行資金轉帳。該平台支援港幣及人民幣付款。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與 FPS，實現所有支付參與者之間的全面連通。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，FPS 預計於 2018 年 9 月啟動。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個工作小組，成員包括主要信用卡發卡機構、銀行、持牌儲值支付工具發牌機構及商戶收單機構，以建立香港零售支付的通用二維碼標準。通用二維碼標準將有助商戶使用單一二維碼接受來自多間支付服務提供者的二維碼付款方案，為消費者及商戶帶來更大便利。該工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式程式設計介面\n\n開放式應用程式介面（Open API）讓第三方得以存取銀行的資料，有助於促進銀行及其他行業所提供的服務更為便捷及容易整合。用戶因此可在一個系統中方便地享受整合服務，並在安全的環境中使用。為促進銀行業界對開放式應用程式介面的發展與採用，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已擬備一份開放式應用程式介面框架草案，內容包括一組開放式應用程式介面功能及部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商管理、促進措施及維護模式，並進行兩個月的行業諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n其中一項重要的研究專案是關於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。在2016年發表第一份DLT白皮書後，於2017年10月發表了第二份DLT白皮書。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證（Proof-of-Concept）案例，分別為貿易融資、數位身分管理以及房貸申請。此外，該白皮書也提供有關治理、法律與合規以及一般控制原則的實踐問題建議，用以協助銀行與支付產業部署DLT。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德銘於香港金融管理局金融科技日宣佈發佈有關區塊鏈的第二份白皮書。\n\n繼香港金融管理局領導的貿易融資概念驗證工作取得成功後，香港七間銀行決定將原型系統商業化，建立名為「香港貿易融資平台」（HKTFP）的生產系統，以實現貿易文件的數位化與共享，自動化流程，從而改善整體貿易流程，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險與詐欺行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作啟動「金融科技職業加速計劃」。學生的反應十分正面，共有421名申請人提交了超過3,000份申請。最終，有74名學生獲得了香港金融管理局及12間銀行的實習機會，從2017年7月起，參與與金融科技相關的項目，實習期為半年或一年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n為加強我們在廣東廣州-香港-澳門灣區內的合作，我們與深圳合作，推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於六月簽署協議，內容包括：(一)為金融科技企業提供雙向軟著陸支持；(二)於十月共同舉辦深港金融科技獎，以表彰及獎勵兩地優秀的金融科技產品與解決方案；以及(三)為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德銘（中）於香港金融管理局金融科技日，與金融資料共享辦公室總監何曉軍（左）及創新科技園董事局主席李家鼎博士簽署及交換有關軟著陸安排的備忘錄。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎電子宣傳單\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務管理局簽訂金融科技合作協議，就創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊分享及專業知識交流等方面展開合作。\n\n11月，香港金融管理局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署備忘錄，共同建設全球貿易連通網絡（GTCN），以將新加坡國家貿易平台與香港貿易金融平台（HKTFP）相連，建立跨境區塊鏈基礎設施，以實現跨境貿易及貿易融資流程的數位化，使其更安全、更高效且更具成本效益。該平台將是一個開放平台，未來允許其他有意參與的司法管轄區加入。GTCN預計於2019年第一季啟動。\n\n# 資金科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年9月啟動的FSS，已升級為FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行及科技公司的溝通，促進新理念和新舉措的落實。具體而言，FSS 2.0 新增以下功能：  \n- 設立金融科技監管對話室，以便在銀行及科技公司進行金融科技項目初期階段提供意見。  \n- 科技公司可透過對話室尋求意見，而無需經由銀行便可使用FSS。  \n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局的沙盒已聯通，使跨行業金融科技產品的試點計劃可透過單一入口進行。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS已測試了28項新興科技產品。其中14項試點試驗已完成，相關產品隨後已陸續推向市場。\n\n# 銀行業務輕鬆辦行動方案\n\n為簡化銀行業流程，減少阻礙科技創新之監管摩擦，已啟動「銀行業務簡化」計劃。目前設有專案小組，重點關注以下領域：\n- 遠端開戶及帳戶管理\n- 網路金融\n- 網路財富管理\n\n# 網上銀行\n\n無實體分行的虛擬銀行預期將為香港金融科技的應用帶來額外動力，並為流動及數位銀行服務提供一種全新的客戶體驗。它們亦可能有助推動金融包容性，因為它們通常針對零售市場，包括個人或中小型企業（SMEs）。香港金融管理局已展開對現有虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 智能銀行的新時代\n\n# 規範與創新\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）去年推出的七項倡議，旨在為香港迎接智能銀行的新時代作準備，是一個涉及HKMA內各部門協作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為不可逆的趨勢，HKMA銀行監管局總監陳瑞龍表示，作為監管機構，HKMA必須積極接納這項新趨勢，緊貼最新科技發展，適時調整監管思維與方式，以提升銀行服務及客戶體驗至更高層次。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 交易所基金\n\n# 稽核長報告\n\n# 獨立會計師報告 送交財政司司長\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人確認已審計交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）於第157至243頁所載之財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及集團於2017年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收入支出表、綜合損益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公平地反映該基金及集團於2017年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該財務狀況在該會計年度內的財務表現及現金流，並符合香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）的規定，而該準則由香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈。財務報表亦已按照根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條由行政長官作出的指示適當編製。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據《發鈔基金條例》第7條所頒佈的行政長官指令及審計委員會的審計準則進行審計。根據這些準則，我的職責已在我的報告中「財務報表審計的審計師職責」部分進一步說明。我根據這些準則保持獨立於集團，並已按照這些準則履行其他倫理責任。我相信，我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 重要審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指在吾專業判斷下，於審計2017年12月31日結賬年度財務報表時具有最重要意義的事項。這些事項是在審計財務報表整體過程中處理的，並在形成吾意見時予以考慮，吾並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港貨幣管理局2017年年度報告內的所有資料，惟不包括財務報表及我的會計師就該財務報表所作出的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不包括其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時考慮該其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中所獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否明顯存在重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我有責任報告此一事實。就此事而言，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 財政司司長及發鈔銀行諮詢委員會審計小組委員會就財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）及根據《發行基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，編製提供真實、公允視角的財務報表，並負責貨幣管理局認為為確保財務報表無重大錯報（無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致）而必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局有責任評估集團持續經營的能力，並根據情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並以持續經營的會計基礎進行會計處理。\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會負責監督集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 會計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確認整體財務報表在重大錯誤或舞弊的情況下是否不存在重大不正確，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不代表根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總能發現已存在的重大不正確。不正確可能源自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合計起來，可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計，我會秉持專業判斷並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：  \n- 識別並評估財務報表中重大誤報的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。由於詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，因此未能察覺因詐欺導致的重大誤報的風險，高於因錯誤導致的重大誤報；  \n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但此目的並非用以對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；  \n- 評估貨幣當局所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及會計估計的合理性及其相關披露是否恰當；  \n- 對貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，或若相關披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我出具審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營的實體；  \n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露資訊，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現實體交易和事件的方式進行呈現；  \n- 取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以就集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行工作，我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會就審計的預計範圍及時間安排以及重大審計發現等事項進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中所識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向發行基金顧問委員會的審計小組委員會提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與發行機構財務委員會審計小組所溝通的事項，我已評估出對本期財務報表審計而言最具重要性的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或規則禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極少數情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果將合理地超過披露該事項對公共利益的效益，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\nDavid Sun\n審計長\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n根據財政司的授權，貨幣管理局作為發行基金（基金）的主管機構，根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的兌換價值，並確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產被管理為四個組合：後備組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。後備組合的資產完全與香港的貨幣基礎相匹配，根據香港的貨幣發行局制度。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私人股權及不動產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由香港特別行政區政府為基金的戰略目的而購入的。經營部門資訊請參閱附註30。\n\n# 二、重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 是一個總稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港特許會計師學會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋及會計準則，並符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其子公司（以下統稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新訂及修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於當前會計期間首次生效或可供早期採用。附註三提供有關因首次採用這些發展而導致會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並說明這些變更對本集團在這些財務報表所載當前及前會計期間的相關影響。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在合營企業及聯營公司的權益。主要子公司、聯營企業及合營企業的主要業務，請參閱附註16及17。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按下列會計政策中所說明的公允價值計列：  \n- 交易性金融工具（參見附註 2.6.2.1）；  \n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（參見附註 2.6.2.2）；  \n- 可供出售證券（參見附註 2.6.2.5）；  \n- 黃金（參見附註 2.11）；以及  \n- 投資性不動產（參見附註 2.12）。\n\n依香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製財務報表，需管理層作出影響會計政策應用及資產、負債、收入及開支所報告數字的判斷、估計及假設。這些估計及相關假設是根據經驗及其他各項因素作出，並在當時情況下認為合理，其結果成為作出有關資產及負債攜帶價值判斷的基礎，而這些攜帶價值並非來自其他來源。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及其相關假設會持續進行審查。若修正僅影響當期，則會在該期間認列會計估計數字的修正；若修正同時影響當期及未來期間，則會在修正期間及其後的各期認列。\n\n附註18包含有關投資性不動產公允價值評估所涉及的假設資訊。附註36包含有關金融工具公允價值評估所涉及的假設資訊。除與這些公允價值評估相關的會計判斷外，集團會計政策的應用中不涉及其他重大會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司與非控制性權益\n\n子公司為集團所控制之實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而有權獲得變動性回報，或有權取得變動性回報，且能透過其對該實體之控制權影響該回報。評估集團是否具控制權時，僅考量實質權利（由集團及其他當事人所持有）。\n"}
