{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","zh":"# 2015 年精彩回顧\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現疲軟。本地股市因全球金融市場波動加劇而出現大幅波動。在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅樓市開始趨於軟化。\n\n香港銀行業仍具備韌性。在香港註冊的持牌金融機構（AIs）的資本充足，其流動資金狀況持續良好。零售銀行的資產質素略有下降，但仍維持在良好水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n港元兌美元匯率大致穩定，今年四月、九月及十月多次觸發強方兌換承諾。儘管全球金融市場波動，港元匯率市場仍持續有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度對外來衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。繼美國聯邦儲備系統決定提高聯邦基金利率目標範圍後，香港基準利率於12月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n人工智能風險治理的監管力度已加大，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布在香港實施逆周期資本緩衝，並指定五間獲授權機構為本地系統重要銀行。立法會已分別引入建立金融機構解決機制及加強存款保障計劃（透過加快賠付）的相關建議。\n\n# 國際金融中心，\n\n香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。一項旨在改善稅務環境，以促進香港成為企業財務中心樞紐的立法建議已於十二月提交立法會。\n\n香港仍為全球離岸人民幣業務中心，擁有廣泛且深厚的市場。內地與香港基金互認安排已於七月實施，進一步擴展香港的人民幣產品範疇。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施因十二月成功推出易支票服務而進一步提升，讓客戶可網上發出及存入支票。一套新的監管制度，規範多用途儲值設施的發牌及指定重要的零售支付系統，已於十一月開始實施。\n\n# 儲備管理\n面對嚴峻的投資環境，香港儲備基金錄得整體投資回報為-0.6%。截至2015年底，基金總資產達到3,422.9億港元。\n\n香港金融管理局加快投資多元化，尤其透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）進行相關投資。截至2015年底，LTGP項下的投資總值達1421億港元，其中私募股權投資佔913億港元，房地產投資則佔508億港元，尚有1224億港元的投資承諾未到位。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及各項其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的理解。為提升企業管治水平，管理局一方面支持員工的專業發展，另一方面嚴守財務紀律，加強資訊安全，並重新調整高級管理層的職責，從而應對實施新措施及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融狀況\n\n二零一五年，香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現不佳。預計二零一六年經濟增長將持續疲軟，受到嚴峻的外部逆風和脆弱的金融市場狀況影響。\n\n# 經濟總評\n\n# 總體情況\n\n香港經濟在年內增長放緩，實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長由2014年的2.6% 降至2.4%（表1）。此現象反映本地需求增長放緩，但淨出口對GDP增長貢獻回升，原因是總進口下降幅度較總出口為大（圖表1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞動市場維持穩定，失業率約為3.3%的低水平。由於本地成本及進口價格壓力減緩，通脹進一步緩和。本地股市在國際金融市場波動加劇的情況下，出現大幅波動。二月份公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始趨於平穩，年末樓價亦顯示出企穩的跡象。\n\n圖表 1 實際國內生產總值增長，按貢獻分析\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n表一 實質GDP按支出構成的環比增長\n\n註：經季節調整後的固定資本形成總額按季變動率目前未有。\n來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年港元匯率保持穩定，兌美元匯率徘徊於約7.75附近。由於與股權相關的資金流入，4月份觸發了可兌換承諾，其後又於9月及10月因離岸人民幣兌換港元以及部分商業對港元的需求而再次觸發。 隨著結餘總額擴大，本地利率持續維持低水平，而金管局基本利率則在12月中旬美國加息後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於貸款需求放緩，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放慢，由2014年的12.7%減至2015年的3.5%。銀行業整體資產質素略為下降，但貸款分類比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年，國內需求增長速度放緩。儘管就業與收入情況大致穩定，持續為經濟提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱以及資產價格調整，在當年下半年抑制了民間消費增長。然而，由於上半年相對強勁的增長勢頭，全年月增長率較去年同期上升至4.8%，而2014年的增長率為3.3%。政府消費則略為加快，增長3.4%。事實上，國內需求增長放緩的主要原因是固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（見圖2）。民間部門的機器設備投資連續第二年出現下滑，反映出商務信心惡化，而建築與工程活動也呈現出較弱的增長動能，與公共項目進展的延緩相伴。\n\n# 市場需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年轉差（圖表3）。商品出口錄得1.7%的跌幅，是自2009年以來的首次。對日本和歐盟的出口下降，而對美國的出口增長則微乎其微。這些發達市場的總體需求疲弱，對區域工業活動和區域內貿易構成不利影響。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、南韓和台灣的出口亦受到影響，同樣呈現下降。香港的服務出口持續從早年的高增長軌道放緩，2015年錄得0.6%的跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊需求減少。商品進口亦因內需及出口帶動的需求走弱而下降。相反，本地居民的旅遊支出則推動了服務進口的增長。總體而言，2015年香港的貿易順差略為改善，對GDP增長作出了輕微的正面貢獻。\n\n圖表 2 內需\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n核心通脹於2015年進一步回落，主要受到本地成本壓力減退及進口物價通脹降低的影響。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，核心通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（見圖4）。由於經濟活動溫和，勞工成本壓力保持穩定，而商業及工業租金成本壓力則有所緩解，尤其是在下半年。受惠於全球商品價格下跌及港元保持強勁，進口物價壓力減輕，食品通脹亦維持低水平。較早季度新租賃住宅租金的影響溫和，使通脹中的租金成分得以有效控制。\n\n圖3 商品及服務出口\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n圖4 核心消費者物價上升\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融狀況\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年勞動市場狀況保持穩定。就業需求持續堅挺，儘管貿易及旅遊相關行業就業人數略為下降，但其他商業領域的穩健招聘抵消了此影響，總就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。勞動供給亦增加1.3%，經季節調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%（圖5）。鑒於勞動市場依然緊張，今年前三個季度名義勞工收入上漲4.7%，高於2014年的4.3%。隨著通脹壓力緩解，今年前三個季度實際勞工收入增加1.3%，而2014年同期則下降0.1%。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2015年經歷了波動的一年，主要受外部環境的劇烈變化所影響。年初，市場表現平穩，但隨著內地A股市場持續向好以及資金流入，本地股市在第二季顯著回升。4月份，恒生指數創下七年新高，滬港通南向每日額度更首次被完全額滿（見圖6）。然而，自六月底起，市場氣勢逆轉，恒生指數在內地A股市場及全球股市的拋售、全球外匯市場波動加劇以及國際商品價格下滑等多重因素影響下，於九月份跌至年內最低點，跌幅達28%。在隨後的第四季，全球及內地金融市場逐漸企穩，香港股市亦有所回升。2015年全年，恒生指數錄得7.2%的跌幅，為自2011年以來的最差年度表現。同期，平均每日成交額由2014年的695億港元上升至1056億港元。儘管下半年集資活動有所放緩，本地股市全年籌集的股本資金總額仍增至11156億港元，較一年前的9427億港元大幅增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現盤整跡象。在2015年初經歷一段活躍期後，住宅物業市場於二月第七輪審慎措施公布後趨於軟化。儘管房價在第四季下跌前上漲速度放緩，但2015年全年房價累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期減少12.3%，降至55,982單位，原因是二手市場交易活動在下半年明顯下滑。投機性交易，包括確認交易及短線倒賣交易，持續保持在低水平。儘管如此，家庭購房負擔仍持續沉重，價格收入比達15.7，收入負擔比遠高於長期平均水準。商用及工業物業市場上半年表現活躍，但交易活動隨後趨緩，價格與租金在第四季均出現下跌。租金報酬率大致與去年同期持平，並維持在歷史低點附近。\n\n圖表6 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 經濟與金融狀況\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟背景\n\n香港的經濟增長預期於2016年將持續放緩。 私人分析機構預測，經濟平均增長率將為1.7%，而政府則預測增長幅度介乎1%至2%。 具體而言，全球經濟前景不明朗、入境旅遊持續低迷，以及全球金融市場波動帶來的負面影響，將繼續抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，預期私人消費將溫和增長，但勞工市場或將面臨壓力，原因是經濟增長勢頭減弱，本地資產價格調整亦可能影響消費者信心，並引發負面財富效應。建築及地盤工程活動預計將維持穩定，惟企業信心偏弱以及利率上升將對私人資本投資構成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2016年通膨壓力將趨於可控。進口價格壓力預料將維持溫和，而國內成本壓力則在經濟溫和增長的情況下，預期也將保持穩定。由於2015年底新簽訂房屋租賃市場壓力減緩，租金因素對通膨的影響亦可能降低。市場普遍預測2016年整體通膨率為2.5%，而政府則預估核心通膨率為2.0%。受入境觀光人數減少及出口持續疲軟的影響，勞動市場可能略為鬆動。民間機構分析師目前預期2016年失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 考慮與挑戰\n\n二零一六年經濟前景面臨多項不確定因素及風險。特別是美國利率進一步上調的步伐、全球經濟增長前景以及商品價格走勢，將持續構成主要的影響因素。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動，進而收緊本地貨幣及金融環境，並對香港的經濟增長前景造成壓力。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將在很大程度上取決於它們對房地產市場的影響，透過財富效應及資產負債表效應所產生的漣漪效應。儘管房地產市場正面臨源於全球及本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及住宅需求與供應缺口收窄等因素而日益增加的下行風險，但仍需更多時間以評估房地產市場是否已進入下行周期。儘管房地產市場的急劇調整可能對整體經濟構成挑戰，但過去幾年實施的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施已顯著增強香港銀行體系的穩健性。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在年內仍表現出韌性，儘管先進經濟體貨幣政策持續分化，以及新興市場經濟體潛在風險逐漸累積。持牌金融機構的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的持牌金融機構則資本充足。零售銀行資產質素略為下降，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n與美國美元利率相符，香港港元銀行同業利率全年維持低位。零售銀行港元資金成本上半年因綜合利率下降而有所調整，下半年則維持穩定（見圖7）。\n\n圖表 7 HIBOR 基準利率、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率（BLR）\n說明：\n1.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港法定匯率制度於2015年全年大致保持穩定，儘管當時金融市場波動，且美國於十二月開始加息。貨幣市場持續暢順運作，銀行間流動性充裕。作為過去數十年來支撐香港貨幣及金融穩定的關鍵機制，聯繫匯率制度持續展現出高度的穩定性，能有效應對外部衝擊。\n\n# 目標如下\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定指港元在匯率市場上對美元的匯率，維持於港幣7.75至7.85元兌1美元的區間內。 貨幣體系的結構以貨幣局制度為特色，要求貨幣基礎至少由匯儲基金持有的美元儲備完全支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須與匯儲基金中美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包含。\n\n債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供十足擔保\n政府發行的在流通中的紙幣及硬幣\n結算餘額，即銀行於香港金融管理局持有的結算戶餘額總和\n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及票據\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定，透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）來維持。當對港元的需求大於供應，市場匯率強升至強方可兌換承諾水平，即每美元7.75港元時，HKMA會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此時結餘將擴大，壓低港元利率，促使港元匯率從強方限制回調至7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。反之，若港元供應大於需求，市場匯率下跌至弱方可兌換承諾水平，即每美元7.85港元時，HKMA則會向銀行購入港元。此時結餘將收縮，推高港元利率，使港元匯率從弱方限制移動至7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。\n\n本處所列的債務證書及流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣，均以港幣面值列示。匯兌基金在《本年度報告》中的資產負債表所列對應項目，則以港幣表示，相等於根據資產負債表日期的匯率，兌換所需美元金額。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\n本報告所列EFBN金額與交換基金於本年度報告的資產負債表所示金額不同。 根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表交換基金在二級市場交易交換基金票據 (EFBN) 時，所持有的EFBN將與已發行的EFBN互相抵銷，其淨額將記錄於資產負債表內。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 年度總結\n\n# 匯率之穩定\n\n2015年，港元兌美元匯率大致維持穩定，交易於7.7500至7.7657之間（見圖表1）。年初，市場對美國加息的擔憂對港元構成輕微貶值壓力。然而，第二季期間，聯繫匯率制度的干預下，港元匯率回升至接近7.75水平，4月份更因股市活動暢旺，相關股票需求增加，導致聯繫匯率制度多次啟動。下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現調整，全球外匯市場（包括人民幣）波動加劇，港元兌美元匯率仍維持在接近7.75的水平。9月及10月，受離岸人民幣兌換成港元的影響，聯繫匯率制度再次啟動。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調25個基點，但港元兌美元匯率仍維持在窄幅區間內波動，未見顯著資金外流。總體而言，儘管全球金融市場動盪，2015年香港外匯市場運作暢順。\n\n圖一 2015年市場匯率\n\n總結餘在四月、九月及十月多次觸發強方貨幣單位（CU）的情況下，香港金融管理局被動地從銀行購入合共293億美元，並以2272億港元交換。此舉導致總結餘相應擴大，部分擴大則因應銀行對流動資金管理需求強勁，而透過額外發行發行基金票據來抵消（見圖2）。 額外發行發行基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度，因為它代表了貨幣基礎的組成結構轉變，而貨幣基礎完全以外匯儲備支持。截至2015年底，總結餘、未償發行基金票據及票據總額增至12210億港元，較前一年的9925億港元增加。\n\n圖表 2 2015 年總餘額及交換基金票據未償還餘額\n\n# 短期資金市場\n\n在銀行體系流動性充裕的情況下，2015年香港銀行同業拆息利率持續維持低水平。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）由0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%後，香港銀行根據預設公式，於12月17日將基準利率亦上調至0.75%。2015年全年，隔夜至三個月期銀行同業拆息利率均低於基準利率（見圖3），波動幅度溫和，主要受銀行季節性資金需求及8月份金融市場波動導致的流動性收緊影響。香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）之間的利差大致同步，香港元遠期點數於8月因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著升水，年末則因美元利率普遍上調而轉為貼水（見圖4）。總體而言，貨幣市場運作暢通，再貼現窗口借款活動不踴躍，2015年全年僅錄得28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖表3 2015年香港銀行同業拆息利率\n\n圖表4：2015年港元遠期點數\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年創立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直運作暢順，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定長久貢獻良多。 鑒於香港經濟規模較小且開放，並扮演國際金融中心的關鍵角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定承諾維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府的承諾，市民對港元作為支付手段及價值儲存的信心持續穩固。在二零一五年對香港進行的第四條審查中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續肯定聯繫匯率制度是香港的最佳貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架，充足的財政儲備，靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑒於穩健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管，以提升銀行業的韌性。 鑒於美國利率上升，香港金融管理局提醒公眾應做好風險管理的必要準備，並指出觸發弱方兌換保證及港元資金外流，是港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高發行基金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中劃出特定部分用以支撐貨幣基礎。2015年，後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3至107.5%的窄幅範圍內，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平，並於12月31日收市於106.3%（圖5）。根據LERS，雖然已將特定發行基金資產指定用作後備組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財政資源在面對突發性衝擊時，可為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強有力的保障。\n\n圖表5 2015年Backing Ratio的每日波動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港結匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣發行局小組負責監察及審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。 2015年，該小組審閱了包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應情況、國際宏觀審慎措施的應用、美國加息對香港物業市場的影響、基礎利率的計算公式、港元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興經濟體的主權風險等議題。 該小組的討論記錄以及提交給該小組的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已發佈於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。二零一五年，該中心資助了16位研究員，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構主辦了五場國際會議及研討會，主要有：\n\n第六屆國際中國經濟會議於一月舉行，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。會議匯報了十一篇高品質研究論文，涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸繁榮與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等議題。\n五月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、制度與經濟增長會議」。會議探討了多項經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n十月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦準備系統、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」會議。會議探討了貨幣政策、國際資本流動及匯率之間的關係、貨幣政策分歧對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對其他地區的影響，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等議題。\n\n香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）於八月舉辦了第十三屆夏季研討會，並於九月舉辦了第十三屆內地經濟研討會，重點探討了中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。是次研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的專業人士參與。此外，中心年內共舉辦了二十四場公開研討會，內容涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通銀行券總值為港幣360.2億元，較一年前上升5.3%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的紙幣及硬幣總值為港幣11.2億元，較一年前上升2.9%（圖9及10）。政府發行的港幣10元紙幣總值為港幣40億元，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在認可機構的風險管治上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售手法。隨著系統性風險的積累，香港金融管理局於2016年1月1日宣布對香港實施0.625%的逆周期資本緩衝（並於2017年1月1日提高至1.25%）。五間認可機構被指定為系統重要性銀行，將需遵守較高的資本吸收能力緩衝。在《金融機構（紓困及重整）條例草案》提交立法會後，有關復原及重整的改革工作取得重大進展。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、加強消費者教育，以及提升銀行董事及金融專業人員的技能與知識水平。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑑於主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧，新興市場於2015年面臨較高風險的資本外流及經濟增長放緩。為維持銀行體系對抗宏觀經濟環境可能出現的急劇惡化，香港金融管理局持續密切監察授權機構的風險管治及信貸及流動性風險管理系統的有效性。\n\n# 運作監督\n\n二零一五年，香港金融管理局繼續採用監管方法，即在定期現場檢查的基礎上，增加主題性審查的數量。主題性審查是對選定的持牌機構特定風險領域或具體活動進行的深入非現場審查。 這種方法使香港金融管理局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於持牌機構新興及更重要的風險。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局共進行了193次現場檢查。鑒於部分金融機構貸款組合的資產質量出現跡象，管理局加強了對信貸風險管理及資產質素的深入主題性現場檢查。為應對主要先進經濟體貨幣政策轉變所帶來的市場不確定性，管理局亦增加了對財務相關活動的檢查次數。此外，管理局還對與內地業務相關的業務、壓力測試、流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）控制，以及授權金融機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型進行了現場檢查。本年度內，專門團隊亦對授權金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查類似的範圍。表1列出了運作監督工作的詳細資料。\n\n二零一五年，進行了196項場外審查，以評估金融機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運營。監管重點集中於風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸以及巴塞爾協議III標準的落實監測。監管團隊與所選金融機構的董事會及外部審計師保持頻繁聯繫。與金融機構高層管理人員及外部審計師召開了20次三方會議，另與所選金融機構的董事會或董事會委員會舉行了23次會議。\n\n銀行監理審查委員會審議了四宗涉及人工智能授權的案件。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以應對多項優先事項，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條賦予的權力，要求持牌銀行委任外部審計師跟進潛在的重大監管議題。2015年，香港金融管理局根據此條款委託了六份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制措施（AML\/CFT），另外兩份報告則涵蓋私人銀行業務，其餘報告則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，沒有人工智能系統違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動性比率的規定。雖然根據《銀行條例》各項條文，共有84宗違規情況，但均未影響存款人的利益，並且已由相關人工智能系統及時糾正。\n\n表1 運作監督\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條的權力\n\n滙理銀行有限公司繼續受到《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力約束。2008年6月25日，香港金融管理局根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對滙理銀行有限公司香港分行的事務、業務及財產所作出的指示，在本年度內仍然有效。香港金融管理局將繼續與相關部門保持定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總行相關的發展情況，並會密切留意所採取的監管措施，以保障持牌金融機構存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評估\n\nCAMEL審批委員會審查並確定各AI的綜合CAMEL評級。各AI已獲通知其評級，並有機會申請複核。本年度內無任何申請複核。\n\n# 專門監督工作\n\n# 營運及科技風險監控\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續就營運及科技風險管理發布新的或更新的指引，以應對新興風險及行業發展。特別是，香港金融管理局已完成有關電子銀行（e-banking）的《監察政策手冊》（SPM）模組的修訂，使持牌銀行在提供新的電子銀行服務方面擁有更大的靈活性。此外，香港金融管理局亦發布了一項通函，重申持牌銀行董事會及高層管理人員需對有效的網絡安全風險管理進行監督。香港金融管理局亦定期發布其《營運事件通報》，重點介紹所選詐騙案件或運作事件的犯罪手法，以及所識別出的監控漏洞。\n\n香港金融管理局進行以風險為本的主題現場及非現場監管審查，評估所選持牌銀行在企業層面或特定業務範疇內的營運及科技風險管理情況。 這些審查涵蓋持牌銀行營運風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防範異常交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢的科技控制等範疇。 這些監管審查亦配合年度獨立合規評審，評審內容包括營運風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性規劃。 根據此要求，所選持牌銀行須委聘獨立且具資格的評審人員，檢視其相關控制措施的充分性，並修復所發現的不足。 金融管理局亦識別並分析持牌銀行營運及科技風險的趨勢及監管重點，特別針對在維持香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的持牌銀行。\n\n香港金融管理局監察銀行業在2015年底完成基於晶片的自動櫃員機技術的最後階段實施，透過此技術，持牌金融機構已完成純信用卡的換卡程序。金管局亦要求發卡機構實施認證控制，以進一步提升非親身信用卡交易的安全性。另外，接獲報告指部分非接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可能被暗中存取後，金管局要求相關持牌金融機構迅速採取行動，通知及保障受影響的持卡人。金管局投入資源向公眾宣傳及解釋事件的規模及影響，以處理公眾疑慮，並監察持牌金融機構的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n金管局與業界及其他持份者合作，推動一系列措施，包括公眾宣傳電子銀行安全注意事項的計劃、建立網絡安全情報分享平台，以及為香港金融服務業務持續管理論壇舉辦的危機管理演習提供支援及建議，該演習參與機構包括人工智能公司及其他金融機構。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就多間人工智能系統銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引及進行監督。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融管理局聯席委員會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議涵蓋了金融機構或受規管實體在金融服務行業不同領域內密切業務關係的各項議題，以確保監管行動更協調及有效。\n\n年內，金管局進行了二十五項現場及非現場主題審查，並對十五間持牌機構進行非現場監察。 這些審查涵蓋了投資產品銷售、證券交易結算及客戶證券的妥善保管，以及面向零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品及強積金相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月，香港金融管理局向經紀人發出通函，就向客戶銷售非壽險投資產品時的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助經紀人遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與財政及庫務局（FSTB）在《保險公司（修訂）條例2014》的立法過程中密切合作，以建立一個獨立的保險業監管局，並為保險中介人設立法定牌照制度。2015年7月，立法會通過《保險公司（修訂）條例2015》，其中規定，透過授權，金融管理局可就保險中介人活動進行檢查和調查。\n\n金管局已處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RI）的申請，以及一宗RI從事額外受規管活動的申請。亦已批准了204名負責監督RI證券業務的高級管理人員，並對RI提交予金管局以納入其維護的登記冊的9,697名個人進行了背景審查。\n\n# 庫務監管\n\n人工智能機構的流動性風險管理一直是香港金融管理局（HKMA）的監管重點，尤其是在美國利率預期正常化，以及隨後資金流動可能出現逆轉，對其流動性構成影響的背景下。 2015年全年，金管局持續實施加強版的穩定資金要求，以確保持牌機構擁有充足的穩定資金支持其貸款業務。 自2015年1月1日起實施巴塞爾III流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）以來，金管局一直監測第一類金融機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構普遍維持LCR在100%或以上，遠高於根據分階段實施安排於2015年設定的法定最低要求60%。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）對選定的授權金融機構的風險管理控制架構，就預期利率正常化相關風險進行主題性現場檢查。在市場波動期間，金管局亦密切關注市場變化及其對銀行業及個別授權金融機構的影響，並採取適當的後續行動。\n\n# 高層主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行由監管機構主導的自下而上的壓力測試計劃，旨在更深入了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟環境下所展現的韌性，並鼓勵這些銀行制定應對突發金融壓力的應對方案。為更精準地評估所選範疇的風險動態，本年度引入了多項改進措施，以收集更詳盡的數據。金管局分析了參與機構提交的測試結果，並與其深入探討如何進一步完善壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產質量\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n近年來觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已趨緩。全年而言，銀行業總貸款額增長3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著減少（見表2）。由於存款增長速度高於銀行貸款，2015年底整體貸款佔存款比率降至70.1%，較一年前的72.2%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，促使各國加強國際合作與溝通，以維護金融穩定。當年，香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施建設、優化監管及稅務制度，以及積極利用人民幣國際化進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港穩健的經濟基本面及優良的財政表現，持續獲得信貸評級機構的認可，標準普爾維持對香港的AAA最高評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，就影響全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題提供意見。今年七月，香港金融管理局接任亞洲金融穩定委員會區域諮詢小組（Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia，FSB RCG(A)）的共同主席，任期兩年。該小組旨在促進金融穩定委員會成員及非成員之間的政策協調，鼓勵實施金融改革，並就金融穩定問題交換觀點。為加強東盟加三（ASEAN+3）各國宏觀經濟合作，香港金融管理局持續與相關當局緊密合作，強化東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office，AMRO）——該辦公室已升格為國際組織——的運作，以監測及分析區域經濟發展，並支持《清邁倡議多邊化協定》（Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation，CMIM）的決策制定。\n\n年內，由於多項市場因素影響，香港的離岸人民幣池及債券發行規模出現了一定程度的收縮。然而，市場持續有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易量均保持穩定增長。此外，香港作為重要的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，有助於國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）將人民幣認定為可自由使用的貨幣。IMF決定將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將進一步推動人民幣國際化，並促進香港離岸市場的持續發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作，以及其持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢至關重要。2015年，香港的人民幣支付系統交易額創下新高。同時，場外衍生工具交易報告平台持續支持機構，按照於七月推出的場外衍生工具市場監管體制，申報相關交易。\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年進一步提升了香港的金融基礎設施，新增多項服務及組成部分。其中，12月成功推出電子支票服務，現時已有超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及流動應用程式渠道，為客戶接收及處理電子支票。自2013年起，電子帳單呈遞及支付（EBPP）服務的商戶參與度持續增長。此外，於7月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMu）在其基金訂單路由服務下推出新服務，以支持內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）的實施。為加強零售支付產品及服務的監管，支付系統及儲值支付工具條例（PSSVFO）於11月生效。根據PSSVFO，香港金融管理局獲授權推行多用途儲值支付工具的強制性牌照制度，並履行相關監管及執法職能，同時指定重要的零售支付系統，確保其在審慎監管下安全高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015 總結\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫日益緊密，香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極與其他司法管轄區合作，透過國際及區域論壇，包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），共同推動可持續經濟增長及金融體系穩定。 金融管理局亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）風險諮詢組（RCG(A)）的聯席主席，並於十月在香港主辦該小組的第九次會議。RCG(A)為金融穩定理事會成員及非成員提供一個重要的溝通與合作平台，以探討金融穩定相關議題。來自亞洲十六個地區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高級代表出席會議，討論該地區所面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、操守風險以及存款保險計劃的經驗。此外，香港金融管理局亦於八月與全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）共同主辦了一場關於宏觀審慎政策的研討會。該研討會吸引了來自世界各地十八個中央銀行的代表參與，與會者分享了宏觀審慎政策的經驗，重點探討政策工具的校準與評估、其與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。香港金融管理局亦與英國銀行及國際貨幣基金組織共同主辦了一場會議，探討中央銀行及其他政策制定者在選擇最佳貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了超過一百名與會者參與，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 加強亞洲貨幣與金融穩定\n\n香港金融管理局一如既往地致力於區域合作，以促進亞洲金融穩定，並在國際金融事務中發揮區內協調作用。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行主管會議（EMEAP）轄下貨幣及金融穩定委員會的宏觀監察工作協調員，金管局持續編寫該委員會的每半年一次的宏觀監測報告，評估區內的風險及脆弱性，以及相關的政策影響。作為EMEAP支付及結算系統工作小組的主席，金管局與副主席緊密合作，協調該小組在經驗分享、風險管理、監察、標準及最佳實務，以及國內及跨境支付及結算系統發展方面的努力。金管局同時領導該工作小組的跨境合作分組。六月，金管局在香港主辦了EMEAP\/BIS外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議。來自區內及主要經濟體的17個機構代表出席了會議，檢討了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革。\n\n在香港與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局去年簽署亞洲貨幣監管組織（AMRO）協議後，AMRO於2016年2月提升為國際組織，以支持其在加強版多邊協調外匯儲備信託機制（CMIM）中的關鍵作用。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局持續與國際信用評級機構保持密切溝通，以呈報香港經濟表現及財政狀況的客觀評估。 這些努力促成了各主要信評機構於2015年維持香港信評評級。標準普爾將香港評級維持於其最高的三A級，反映該機構對香港作為高收入經濟體而言，具有優於平均水平的增長前景、龐大的財政儲備、持續穩健的財政表現以及強勁的淨外部資產狀況的肯定。穆迪投資者服務及惠譽評級也分別維持香港的評級於Aa1和AA+，僅低於三A級一個等級。\n\n# 香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n二零一五年，市場因素影響了香港的人民幣業務。截至年末，客戶的人民幣存款及存款憑證餘額為一千零一十億元，較去年同期減少了一千一百五十八億元（見圖一）。受內地利率下降的影響，離岸人民幣債券發行規模有所收縮，香港的人民幣債券發行總額因此降至七十五億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增長了九百分之九，達到六千八百三十三億元。人民幣銀行貸款的未償餘額亦較去年同期增長了五十八百分之五十八，達到二百九十七億元（見圖二）。人民幣即時總額結算系統（RTGS）的平均每日成交額增至九百四十七億元，較2014年增長了二十九百分之二十九。同時，香港的離岸人民幣外匯市場持續擴展，根據調查結果顯示，截至2015年4月底，日均成交額約為九十三億美元，較2013年4月（上次三行聯席調查進行時）增長了八十八百分之八十八。香港仍然是全球最大的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場深度和廣度俱佳。為進一步鞏固這一地位，2015年7月實施了人民幣基礎設施計劃（MRF），該計劃擴展了香港的人民幣產品供應。\n\n香港金融管理局擴展跨境人民幣資金流動渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界共同推動香港人民幣金融平台建設的努力，持續取得成效。六月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，允許離岸人民幣業務結算銀行及參與銀行在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得資金匯往境外，以便利銀行在離岸市場進行人民幣流動性管理。九月，中國人民銀行放寬跨境人民幣現金池的規定，使更多跨國企業得以在簡化安排下進行集團內資金轉移。同期，內地當局亦擴大了外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金參與境內銀行間債券市場的機會，並在九月進一步開放了內地外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n2015年11月30日，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）宣布決定，自2016年10月1日起將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子。此項決定肯定了人民幣作為自由使用的貨幣的地位，並有助於提升全球社會對人民幣在國際交易中使用的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將受益於人民幣進一步國際化，以及中國內地與全球經濟及金融體系日益加深融合，從而帶來新的業務機遇。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他地區在人民幣業務上的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同主辦了第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，並與倫敦共同舉辦了第五屆人民幣業務論壇。此外，金管局與馬來西亞和泰國再次合作，促進私營機構就人民幣業務進行交流。 這些舉措強化了香港銀行與其他市場的人民幣業務聯繫，為香港帶來更多相關業務。為更廣泛地推動企業及機構在貿易、投資和融資中使用人民幣，金管局亦積極參與香港及加拿大、日本、非洲等海外市場的業界活動，加強市場推廣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁黃燕良先生於2015年12月11日出席香港與倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間的研討會發言。\n\n# 《CEPA》（《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》)\n\n內地與香港於十一月在《更緊密經貿合作安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署新協議，旨在實現服務貿易的基本自由化。 該協議將2014年在廣東省試行的自由化措施擴大至全國範圍，並原則上向香港銀行提供國民待遇，預計將為這些銀行在內地從事業務提供更大的政策確定性和業務靈活性。\n\n# 培訓\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續為中國人民銀行（PBoC）、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行業監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。除了中央銀行業務及一般風險管理的課程外，課程內容還包括消費者保護、信用參考資料、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融健全性指標分析以及系統性風險監測等主題。此外，HKMA亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表團安排了特別培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n年內，香港金管局安排了八次機構政府債券發售，總額為204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n二零一五年全球金融市場波動劇烈，為投資基金帶來嚴峻挑戰。在如此動盪的投資環境下，外匯基金在2015年的總投資回報為-0.6%，但相較於主要市場指數及同類投資基金，其虧損相對輕微。這主要歸功於香港金融管理局過去數年所採取的一系列防禦性措施，有效提升了外匯基金的抗逆力。\n\n# 香港金融管理局匯儲基金\n\n根據《香港儲備基金條例》，香港儲備基金的主要目的是直接或間接影響香港的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港的貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全，以協助香港保持國際金融中心的地位。儲備基金由財政司司長負責管理，並可在諮詢儲備基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，投資於司長認為合適的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交易所資金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\nEFAC已制定以下投資目標，以供投資基金（外匯基金）參考：\n\n維護資本；\n確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均以高度流動性的美元計價資產充分支持；\n確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n依(a)至(c)之條件，以達成有助於維護基金長期購買力之投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了香港金融管理局轄下的投資基金的法定宗旨，並納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金設有兩個主要投資組合：擔保組合及投資組合。擔保組合持有高流動性的美元資產，以根據聯繫匯率制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分擔保。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。兩個投資組合整體的長期目標債券與股票比例為72:28。就目標貨幣配置而言，資產的81%配置於美元及港元，其餘19%配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已以審慎及漸進的方式，將發行基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。香港金融管理局在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持為發行基金累計盈餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP項下的投資市值總計為1,421億港元，其中私募股權為913億港元，房地產投資為508億港元，尚有未落實的投資承諾1,224億港元。\n\n戰略投資組合，為持有香港交易所及結算有限公司股份而於二零零七年設立，此股份乃政府代表投資基金，為策略目的收購。由於此投資組合性質獨特，故此未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資程序\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置，反映於投資標竿，代表聯匯基金在投資目標下，所能達到的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會以戰術方式進行配置，試圖在標竿之上取得超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與標竿或策略性配置有所不同。實際配置與標竿配置之間的差異，被稱為「戰術性偏差」。雖然標竿以及戰術性偏差的上限由財政司長諮詢聯匯基金投資委員會（EFAC）後決定，但戰術決策則由香港金管局在授權下作出。在允許的戰術性偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可以採取策略，以利用短期的市場波動。\n\n# 資產管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部直接管理約76%的交換基金投資，其中包括整個後盾投資組合及部分投資組合。此部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及為基金實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具風險覆蓋組合。\n\n# 外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦聘請位於多個國際金融中心的外部基金經理，管理約24%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他專業投資項目。聘請外部基金經理旨在利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以捕捉多元化的投資風格，並將市場資訊和知識傳遞給內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本，以及預扣稅款和其他稅項。此類支出主要受市場因素影響，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外部管理的投資組合，已建立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並嚴格監控其合規情況。風險控制工具被應用以評估在正常及不利市場環境下的市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內部及外部經理的投資專業能力。\n\n# 交易所基金績效\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動劇烈。股市尤其表現出異常的波動。年初，主要股市創下新高，然而，第三季度因對中國經濟前景的擔憂，市場情緒急劇惡化，主要股市逆轉了年初至今的漲幅，並出現顯著的季度虧損。隨後，隨著市場情緒的改善，全球股市有所復甦，但年底再度走低。由於與中國內地經濟緊密聯動，香港股市在2015年的表現較其他主要股市更為疲弱。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國將啟動利率正常化並開啟升息週期，2015年美國長期國債收益率僅小幅上漲，此舉受到對全球經濟增長擔憂、持續的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張局勢升溫的影響。另一方面，在歐洲央行積極寬鬆貨幣政策的推動下，短期歐洲政府債券收益率走低，部分甚至跌破零利率。\n\n在2015年，外匯市場上，美元持續走強，美元指數上漲近10%，反映了市場預期美國將逐步調整貨幣政策。歐元則在第一季顯著走弱，創下自1999年以來的單季最大跌幅，原因在於歐洲央行於一月份宣布實施量化寬鬆政策。另一方面，日圓對美元的匯率在2015年基本保持穩定。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現，見表一。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 香港匯儲基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在極度波動的金融市場及艱難的投資環境下，2015年錄得投資虧損158億港元。當中，海外股票錄得收益71億港元，香港股票則錄得虧損50億港元。債券投資帶來收益159億港元，但非港元資產因匯率影響，出現了449億港元的匯兌損失。此外，基金投資控股附屬機構所持的其他投資，則帶來了111億港元的收益。 由於去年美元大幅升值，將外匯基金的非美元資產換算為港元時，此匯兌損失難以避免。 另一方面，策略投資組合則錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n外匯基金於2015年底的總資產達到3,4229億港元。 2015年，扣除策略投資組合後，外匯基金的投資回報率為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及整體投資基金界相比，外匯基金的虧損可謂相對輕微。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局（HKMA）近年已推出一系列防守性措施，包括縮短債券投資組合的久期、增加現金持有比例，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化的進程，特別是透過長期投資計劃 (LTGP) 進行的投資。這些措施增強了外匯基金的韌性，並有助減輕部分潛在損失。\n\n基金由1994年至2015年的年度回報請參閱圖表1。表2顯示2015年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均回報。過去三年平均回報為1.2%，過去五年為1.8%，過去十年為3.3%，截至1994年以來則為5.0%。表3顯示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n圖表1 交易所基金投資回報（1994 – 2015）\n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略投資組合的持倉。\n2. 綜合消費物價指數基於以2009\/2010年為基期的系列計算。\n"}

The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 公司職能\n\n金管局透過媒體、公眾教育項目及其他渠道，與社會各界及市場保持緊密溝通，以促進對其政策及營運的理解。 2015年，金管局為提升公司治理，著重員工專業發展、嚴格執行財務紀律、加強資訊科技安全，並重新調整高級管理層的職責，以應對新計劃及系統的推行，以及工作日益複雜帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 聯繫社區 企業發展\n\n# 公關傳媒\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒密切合作，致力提升透明度，並加強公眾對其政策及工作的理解。2015年，共舉行了59項傳媒活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14場即席訪問及31項其他公開活動。此外，安排了43場傳媒專訪，發佈了325份新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n此外，為加強公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的了解，香港金融管理局分別舉辦兩場傳媒參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL），展示香港世界一流的鈔票印製技術及金融基礎設施。同時，亦舉辦了關於貨幣發行制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的教育研討會，詳細介紹這些重要議題。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖（中）及常務董事（貨幣管理）李惠來（右）在香港印鈔有限公司的媒體參觀期間，檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n香港金融管理局在香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL）舉行傳媒參觀時，展示了自動化支票分類系統。照片中央（由左至右）為香港金融管理局總裁陳德棣先生、金融基礎設施執行董事李奕明先生，以及香港銀行同業結算有限公司行政總裁唐麗嫦女士。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公眾詢問\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供有效途徑，以便他們從香港金融管理局（HKMA）獲取資訊，從而更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務於2015年處理了9,078宗查詢，其中約一半涉及銀行政策與法規、紙幣與硬幣，以及消費者銀行業務。值得注意的例子包括樓宇按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、洗錢及恐怖融資，以及硬幣收藏計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年起收到的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則提供2015年按類別劃分的明細。\n\n圖表1 公眾諮詢總數\n\n# 出版\n\n香港金管局除發布年度報告外， прошлом году亦發布了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定局勢報告》、四期《季刊》及定期更新的《月度統計通報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊及分析。此外，金管局高級管理層更發表了十四篇inSight文章，涵蓋多項時弊及及時的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局二零一四年年報，於香港管理學會二零一五年最佳年報獎的「非營利機構及慈善組織」類別中獲得銅獎。\n\n# 金管局網站\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的公司網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）擁有超過50,000頁的英文及繁體和簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取HKMA最新資訊的便捷途徑。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的授權機構（AIs）證券人員登記冊，以及AIs及本地代表辦事處登記冊。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站將會載有根據該條例維護的儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以方便公眾查閱重要及及時資訊，例如提醒市民時刻警惕電話詐騙，以及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣換取櫃位的位置等。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公共教育計畫\n\n香港金融管理局位於國際金融中心二期55樓的資訊中心，是向公眾介紹金管局的工作，並提升市民對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每週開放六天。展覽區介紹金管局的工作，以及香港的貨幣及銀行業發展歷程，提供豐富的閱讀資料和展覽品，讓公眾深入了解香港的貨幣、銀行及金融相關事宜。\n\n資訊中心為訪客安排導覽團。本年度，該中心接待了超過48,300名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導覽團（見圖3）。自2003年12月開幕以來，已有超過530,400人次造訪該中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過二萬三千冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關議題。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，記錄香港授權金融機構的電子登記冊。\n\n金管局為持續推廣社區聯繫計劃，不時舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，共舉辦了三場講座，約有2,300名中學生及教師參與。講座內容包括聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、智能使用信用卡及存款保障計劃。自1998年計劃推出以來，共有超過54,700人參與。\n\n圖表3 資訊中心各類團體參訪類型\n\n年輕訪客在導覽員帶領下，透過參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣與銀行業的發展。\n\n中學學生與教師參與公共教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招募、培訓及發展一支高專業素質的團隊，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但其可採用與公務員制度不同的聘用條件，以吸引擁有豐富經驗和專業知識的人才。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力維持精簡靈活的架構，並重新調配人力資源以推動新計劃及應付增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織調整\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年12月根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》的頒佈，在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立了零售支付監察部，以履行香港金融管理局的新法定職責，包括對儲值設施及其他零售支付系統的牌照發放及日常監管。為加強部門間協調，並重新調整人員資源，以應對實施新措施所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量和複雜性，於2015年已計劃對若干部門的職責進行調整，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎建設部（FID）承接了執行部門（ENFD）的存款保障計劃管理職能與結算功能，以及來自貨幣處（MMD）的相關業務。同時，該部亦負責銀行部門的銀行相關工作，包括消費者教育、董事發展及銀行從業員勝任力框架。\n\n外部部門接掌了MMD的市場開發功能，而後者將繼續處理與財政市場協會及金融指標相關的工作。\n\nENFD 承接了銀行監督處的反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險處的職能，並更名為執法及反洗錢處。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 人員安排\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年的編制為841個。2016年增加34人，總人數增至875人（增加4%），以應付：（i）新法例及措施的實施；（ii）持續推展已驗證必要性的試驗項目；以及（iii）現有工作的日益複雜及工作量增加。新增崗位將調配至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行及金融體系的穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場檢查、落實國際銀行標準及同儕審查。\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監管。\n\n實施規範，針對透過銀行及經紀機構進行的場外衍生工具交易，依照新實施的場外衍生工具報告及記錄保存規定，建立監理架構。\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法工作；\n\n積極備妥實施《金融機構重組法案》的規劃及準備工作，該法案應用國際標準，以應對金融業「太大而不能倒」的問題。\n\n透過發展針對銀行獨立非執行董事的董事賦能計劃，旨在提升銀行治理水平。同時，我們將與業界合作，推動銀行從業人員在核心業務領域的專業能力框架建設，以進一步強化銀行整體運營能力。\n\n積極提升銀行合規政策及在新興銀行、證券和保險產品領域的研究能力。\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；以及\n\n加強對在岸人民幣市場及CNH市場的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n強化投資、風險管理及法律支援，以配合未來基金的設立及交易所基金投資產品的進一步多元化，同時優化戰略資產配置及投資流程，應對日益嚴峻的投資環境。\n\n實施新的法定制度，授權香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》，監管儲值設施及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 公司職能\n\n臨時資源會根據其他工作需求進行調配。香港金融管理局會將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展局，以協助處理與香港或金管局相關的活動或政策倡議。部分員工會以全職或兼職形式借調，為香港存款保障局及財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪資審核機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）會根據匯率基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）的建議，以及監管委員會（GSC）的意見，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並參考現行市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及公積金計劃，實物福利則極為有限。總現金薪酬包由每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及變動薪酬組成，變動薪酬可根據員工的表現，每年以一次性形式發放給個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬，每年均由金融管理局長（FS）進行審核。審核過程會參考顧薪委員會（GSC）透過專責事務委員會（EFAC）提出的建議。這些建議會考慮顧薪委員會對香港金融管理局上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問機構就金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，以及其他任何相關因素。為維持員工薪酬的競爭力，金融管理局長或會不時對表現卓越的個別員工進行特別薪酬調整。\n\n香港金融管理局的任何經批准的固定薪酬年度調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工的個人表現發放。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員適用變動薪酬制度，以更直接地將其投資表現與薪酬聯繫起來。執行總裁或以上職級的員工薪酬調整或獎勵，由金融管理局根據薪酬及人事委員會的建議批准。相關員工在討論其薪酬時並不在場。部門主管及以下職級的員工薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金融管理局總裁根據金融管理局的授權，在批准的總體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 香港金融管理局\n\n審計署署長報告\n外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 審計委員會\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 關於獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司長先生\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於第134至222頁所載的財務報表，該等財務報表包括截至2015年12月31日的聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、綜合收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包含重大會計政策摘要及其他說明性資料。\n\n# 金融管理局對財務報表的責任\n\n金管局負責根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官的指示，以及香港財務報告準則編製真實而公平地反映財務狀況的財務報表，並為此建立其認為有必要之內部控制，以確保財務報表無重大錯報，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計，對這些財務報表發表意見。我按照《庫務條例》第7條及審計署審計準則，由行政長官發出的指示進行了審計。這些準則要求我遵守道德規範，並規劃和執行審計，以合理程度確認財務報表並無重大錯報。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以取得關於財務報表金額及披露事項的審計憑證。所選擇的程序取決於審計人的判斷，包括評估財務報表存在重大錯報的風險，無論此風險源於欺詐或錯誤。在進行風險評估時，審計人會考慮與實體編製能提供真實且公允視圖的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但此目的並非評估實體內部控制的有效性。審計也包括評估所使用的會計政策的恰當性，以及中央銀行所做的會計估計的合理性，並評估財務報表的整體呈現。\n\n我相信已取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n匯生基金截至2015年12月31日的財務報表，真實而公允地反映了該基金及集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已根據香港財務報告準則妥善編製，符合根據《交易所基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示。\n\n孫大衛\n審計總監\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會\n入境大廈26樓\n格洛斯特道7號\n灣仔，香港\n\n# 目錄\n\n收入支出表\n綜合收益表\n資產負債表\n權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註\n\n主要業務\n重要會計政策\n會計政策變動\n收入與支出\n所得稅\n金融資產及金融負債類別\n現金及銀行活期存款\n銀行及其他金融機構存款\n指定按公允價值計量的金融資產\n可供出售證券\n衍生金融工具\n按成本攤銷之債券\n貸款組合\n黃金\n其他資產\n於子公司之權益\n於聯營公司及合資企業之權益\n投資物業\n物業、廠房及設備\n政府債券、紙幣及硬幣\n銀行體系結餘\n銀行及其他金融機構之存款\n財政儲備存放\n香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存放\n發行之外匯基金票據及票息憑證\n銀行貸款\n其他已發行之債務證券\n其他負債\n股本\n現金流量表內現金及現金等價物分析\n業務分部資訊\n質押資產\n承諾\n或有負債\n重大關聯方交易\n金融工具之公平價值衡量\n財務報表日後非調整事項\n截至2015年12月31日止年度已發布但尚未生效之修正案、新準則及詮釋可能產生之影響\n財務報表核准\n\n# 外匯基金 – 收入及支出表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為本財務報表之列。\n\n# 匯管理局基金 – 綜合收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為本財務報表之列。\n\n# 交換基金 – 資產負債表\n\n於二零一五年十二月三十一日為止\n\n諾曼·T.
