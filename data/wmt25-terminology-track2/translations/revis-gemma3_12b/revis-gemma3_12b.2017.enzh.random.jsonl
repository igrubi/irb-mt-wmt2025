{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong

行政長官聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現理想，遠超預期：實體經濟見到穩定增長；通脹仍然溫和；美國聯邦儲備系統在該年三度加息，並縮減資產負債表，卻未造成新興市場經濟的資本外流或美元走強。在樂觀的市場情緒下，全球股市，包括三大美國股市指數，持續創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲34%。恒生指數在2017年錄得近8,000點（或36%）的升幅，並突破30,000點關卡，於1月達到歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境中充滿樂觀，甚至有些過度興奮。然而，這一切持續到今年2月，當最新數據顯示美國工資上升高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市出現顯著調整。道瓊斯指數在2月的第二週兩天內跌超過1,000點，而恆生指數在同週下跌超過3,000點。美國10年期國債收益率上漲至2.95%。資金流動的迅速逆轉顯示，創紀錄的高市場估值並非建立在紥實的根基之上。這也提醒我們，香港需要一個穩健且強健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動和資金外流所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 銀行體系韌性因防患未然措施而提升。\n\n有云：「預防勝於治療」。金管局於2017年進一步實施風險減輕措施，旨在保障香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。5月，我們推出第八輪針對銀行按揭貸款的逆轉措施，並加強銀行對地產商貸款的信貸風險管理，以加強銀行體系對房地產市場任何逆轉的韌性。經過多個輪次的措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率在2017年底跌至49%，而2009年9月的平均貸款價值比率為64%，平均償債比率亦下降至35%，較2010年8月的41%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被認為「大到不能倒」的不可持續金融機構。這將幫助避免重蹈2008年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時政府動用公帑拯救陷入困境的金融機構，並減低這些機構結業對金融體系、經濟及社會大眾的影響。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩定及可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率遠高於適用的法定要求，名列前茅。這毫無疑問顯示香港銀行體系具有高韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款額增加16%，而資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%跌至0.54%，遠低於自2000年起的長期平均2.2%。銀行業整體資本回報率（根據稅前營運利潤計算）在2017年達11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心，屬良好水平。\n\n# 穩健的銀行業是長期，財務穩定性的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機暴露了單憑規則和法規來限制金融業追求利潤，而未有顧及其主要責任的局限。鑒於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）近期加強推廣「穩健銀行」的實踐，鼓勵銀行發展和追求良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是為解決銀行員工追求短期利潤，損害顧客或銀行長期利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行將適當的激勵制度與其企業文化和價值觀相符合。作為此項計劃的一部分，我們於2017年3月安排舉辦首屆獨立非執行董事（INEDs）年度會議，以突顯建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並幫助INEDs更有效地履行其監督和監察的角色。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，2017年是香港金融管理局（HKMA）在推動金融包容方面取得顯著進展的一年。我們開展了6間實體銀行分行及3間流動分行，服務於偏遠地區。香港銀行公會與EPS及便利店連鎖店合作，推出試驗計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的便利店提款，無需購物。香港郵政亦於今年在離島及新界地區的七間郵政局，推出為長者提供的現金提款服務。為方便長者開戶，香港金融管理局去年設立了專頁及電郵賬戶，並安排專責團隊跟進公眾查詢或與開設銀行賬戶相關的投訴。經多方持份者的努力，個人及企業銀行賬戶的開戶流程已顯著改善，為客戶帶來更佳的經驗。\n\n# 金融科技重塑銀行業\n\n在科技快速發展的新紀元，金融科技已逐步融入我們的生活。在這個不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須把握新發展，並在金融科技的應用上追求創新。隨著智慧銀行新紀元的到來，香港金管局於9月推出七項倡議（詳見106頁），推動金融科技在銀行業的採用，以加強銀行產品和服務的品質，惠及顧客。這些倡議彼此獨立，但又互補，將會為香港支付和銀行服務的未來生態帶來重大轉型。顧客不僅可以享受更方便、快捷和安全的支付及銀行服務，而且還將擁有更多選擇和對其金融交易的更大控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來成功的關鍵，邁進智慧銀行的新紀元將為銀行提供一項絕佳的機會，以升級和轉型。\n\n# 由一帶一路和粵港澳大灣區締造的龐大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，多元化金融產業對香港的至關重要性不言而喻。2017年，香港金融管理局加強了其提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。鑑於香港獨特的優勢——「背靠內地，同時維持國際前景」，一帶一路倡議和粵港澳大灣區的發展將帶來龐大的機遇，並為香港的經濟增長帶來新的動力。為呼應一帶一路倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自推出以來，其合作夥伴數字已增至約90個，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資融資中心打下紥實根基。2017年，中國開發銀行在香港發行首隻一帶一路債券，突顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面所能發揮的樞紐地位。\n\n此外，除了基礎設施融資外，我們積極參與香港作為企業財務中心、私募基金及亞洲衍生產品業務的發展，吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在香港管理其資金、資產及多個財務風險。 這些舉措將進一步鞏固和升級香港的金融及相關專業服務範疇。香港金融管理局亦與有關當局維持緊密溝通，以鞏固合作，致力促進粵港澳大灣區作為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直以「善用香港優勢，滿足國家所需」為主軸發展。隨著2014年推出2014年滬港通、2016年推出2016年深港通，以及去年7月推出債券通北向交易後，內地與其他地區通過香港的金融平台，市場互通互聯已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯了香港作為金融平台，促進全球投資者進入內地金融市場的獨特地位。2017年，香港維持其作為離岸人民幣業務領先地位。人民幣實時全額清算系統的日均交易額高達9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計數據，當年全球逾70%的人民幣支付交易均透過香港處理。離岸人民幣市場繼續有序運作，穩定發展。\n\n# 培育人才以鞏固銀行業的實力。\n\n隨著金融業的持續發展，培育人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局注重銀行業的軟實力，我們亦一直鼓勵和支持銀行從業員的持續能力建設。繼推出反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資和網絡安全兩項專業資歷後，去年我們擴展了其覆蓋範圍，包括零售財富管理和資金管理，以提升銀行從業員透過持續專業發展的核心能力。香港金融管理局亦致力培育年青銀行業人才。於2017年，我們與業界合作推出私人財富管理學徒計劃和金融科技人才加速計劃。鑑於壓倒性的呼應，這些計劃的覆蓋範圍將在未來進一步擴展。\n\n# 審慎的投資策略，提供合理的長期平穩回報。\n\n受益於強勁的全球經濟增長，交易所基金去年錄得2,640億香港元的新高投資回報，各類資產均有回報，包括股權、債券及外匯。整體投資回報為7.4%。投資組合取得12.1%的回報率，而後盾組合則錄得1.8%。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）自2009年成立以來的年化內部回報率達13.7%。雖然去年的投資表現佳績，但日益複雜的投資環境需要金管局繼續謹慎管理交易所基金。我們將維持機動，密切監察市場發展，並在適當時候部署防禦措施。LTGP下的投資亦將進一步擴展。一向以來，在可控風險水平內，管理香港市民財富時，將秉承「資本保值為先，長期增長為後」的投資原則。\n\n雖然全球實體經濟延續去年 的升勢，但 2018年仍潛藏著不明朗因素。這些包括我們一旦通脹回升，美國便會加快加息 的步伐，貿易摩擦持續升溫，以及地緣政治生態惡化。若這些下行風險觸發，將對全球金融市場產生顯著 的影響，並對香港 的資金流動、資產價格和實體經濟產生連鎖影響。因此， 應該 謹慎管理風險。\n\n未來數月，相信香港美元利率走勢將維持在焦點上。美國聯邦儲備委員會已提升利率6次，自2015年12月以來。隨著香港美元利率與其美元對應的息差擴闊，資金從香港美元流向美元的動機變得更大。近期香港美元持續承受走弱壓力，且7.85弱方兌換承擔（CU）已被觸發。正如我們多次強調，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，香港金管局將扮演「超級兌換商」的角色，在市場上購買香港美元並出售美元，以保證香港美元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。此類操作屬正常，亦符合聯匯制度的設計。這不應導致任何擔憂。事實上，現時香港外匯基金舉行超過4兆港元資產，其中香港美元貨幣基礎數額約為1.7兆港元，提供強大緩衝。多年來，香港金管局已將多個防線置於地方，以保障銀行及金融系統的穩定。從正面來看，資金外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，這有助於香港利率環境的正常化，因而促進本地經濟及資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，香港金管局將嚴陣以待，並盡每份努力以保持香港的貨幣及銀行體系穩定。\n"}

The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"city":["城市"],"end":["年底"],"people":["市民"],"built":["建立"],"expanded":["擴展"],"achieving":["取得"],"continuing":["持續"],"pursue":["追求"],"us":["我們"],"saw":["見到"],"abound":["潛藏"],"record":["紀錄"],"remained":["仍然"],"since":["自"],"HK":["香港"],"49":["49%"],"launch":["推出"],"first":["首"],"adoption":["採用"],"webpage":["專頁"],"year":["年"],"increasing":["增加"],"facilitating":["促進"],"billion":["億"],"’":["的"],"lives":["生活"],"great":["重大"],"marks":["適逢"],"competence":["能力"],"developments":["發展"],"reversal":["逆轉"],"indicated":["顯示"],"Thanks":["經"],"brought":["帶來"],"secure":["安全"],"introduction":["推出"],"classified":["不良"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"developers":["地產商"],"2014":["2014年"],"transform":["轉型"],"developing":["開展"],"widening":["擴闊"],"strengthen":["鞏固"],"operate":["運作"],"campaign":["計劃"],"upgrade":["升級"],"maintained":["維持"],"technological":["科技"],"hence":["因而"],"2008":["2008年"],"highlight":["突顯"],"era":["新紀元"],"among":["位居…前列"],"role":["地位"],"41":["41%"],"weathered":["克服"],"addition":["此外"],"fell":["跌"],"pursuing":["追求"],"enhancing":["加強"],"coming":["未來"],"launched":["推出"],"times":["次"],"stepped":["加強"],"efforts":["努力"],"February":["2月"],"1.8":["1.8%"],"concerted":["多方"],"established":["設立"],"11.74":["11.74%"],"together":["一同"],"ensure":["保證"],"result":["造成"],"weaken":["走弱"],"responsibilities":["責任"],"play":["發揮"],"modules":["專業資歷"],"RMB900":["9,000億元人民幣"],"2010":["2010年"],"practitioners":["從業員"],"second":["第二"],"involved":["參與"],"closures":["結業"],"integrated":["融入"],"implement":["落實"],"moving":["邁進"],"make":["讓"],"give":["帶來"],"part":["部分"],"convenient":["方便"],"case":["一旦"],"dropped":["下跌"],"also":["亦"],"gained":["錄得"],"May":["5月"],"always":["一向"],"vigilant":["嚴陣以待"],"created":["締造"],"undoubtedly":["顯示"],"light":["情況下"],"round":["輪"],"needs":["所需"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"sustainable":["可持續"],"competition":["競爭"],"2.2":["2.2%"],"increase":["上升"],"7.85":["7.85"],"foundation":["根基"],"accounts":["賬戶"],"revealed":["暴露"],"quarter":["四分之一"],"smoothly":["有序"],"maintain":["保持"],"perform":["發揮"],"recurrence":["重蹈"],"week":["同周"],"3,000":["3,000"],"set":["設立"],"dollars":["美元"],"several":["多個"],"last":["去年"],"including":["包括"],"shocks":["衝擊"],"high":["新高"],"pace":["步伐"],"world":["全球"],"within":["內"],"response":["呼應"],"stated":["強調"],"century":["世紀"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"significant":["顯著"],"adhered":["秉承"],"25th":["25周年"],"satisfactory":["佳績"],"changing":["變"],"extending":["延續"],"Given":["鑑於"],"page":["專頁"],"close":["緊密"],"greater":["更大"],"September":["9月"],"ever":["以來"],"held":["舉辦"],"introduced":["推出"],"coverage":["覆蓋"],"need":["需求"],"Six":["6"],"develop":["發展"],"include":["包括"],"triggered":["觸發"],"manage":["管理"],"25":["25"],"restrain":["制約"],"wage":["工資"],"leveraging":["善用"],"eighth":["第八輪"],"improvement":["改善"],"all-time":["歷史"],"consolidate":["鞏固"],"Enormous":["龐大"],"highlighted":["突顯"],"stood":["高達"],"importance":["重要性"],"agile":["機動"],"responsible":["肩負"],"pivotal":["樞紐"],"reached":["達"],"allowing":["讓"],"good":["好"],"independent":["獨立"],"highs":["新高"],"0.72":["0.72%"],"put":["將"],"0.54":["0.54%"],"advantage":["優勢"],"spotlight":["焦點"],"prevent":["避免"],"around":["約"],"dialogue":["溝通"],"used":["動用"],"cure":["治療"],"safeguard":["保障"],"appropriate":["適當"],"months":["月"],"prompting":["促使"],"particular":["特別"],"advancement":["推動"],"providing":["提供"],"highest":["最高"],"saying":["有云"],"without":["未有"],"nimble":["機動"],"store":["便利店"],"achieved":["取得"],"oversight":["監督"],"corrections":["調整"],"implications":["影響"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"effort":["努力"],"meet":["應對"],"maintaining":["維持"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"continued":["繼續"],"position":["地位"],"minimise":["減低"],"35":["35%"],"expense":["損害"],"empower":["幫助"],"worked":["合作"],"years":["年"],"2018":["2018年"],"closely":["密切"],"issuance":["發行"],"establishing":["樹立"],"long":["長期"],"diversified":["多元化"],"underscores":["突顯"],"landscape":["生態"],"healthy":["健康"],"promoting":["推動"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"easily":["不易"],"solid":["紥實"],"ongoing":["持續"],"task":["任務"],"efficient":["快捷"],"recently":["近期"],"gradual":["逐步"],"back":["背靠"],"positive":["正面"],"fail":["倒"],"perspective":["來看"],"106":["106頁"],"laying":["打下"],"advisable":["應該"],"various":["多個"],"innovation":["創新"],"follow":["跟進"],"attaches":["注重"],"widespread":["廣泛"],"Many":["許多"],"downside":["下行"],"relying":["依靠"],"T.L":["T.L."],"hikes":["加息"],"status":["地位"],"264":["2,640億"],"inaugural":["首屆"],"offer":["帶來"],"bullish":["牛氣沖天"],"next":["之後"],"reappraise":["重新評估"],"society":["社會"],"continue":["繼續"],"outlying":["離島"],"taking":["採取"],"roles":["角色"],"strengthened":["加強"],"areas":["地區"],"one":["一"],"nurturing":["培育"],"Indeed":["事實上"],"levels":["水平"],"enhance":["提升"],"worst":["最壞"],"actively":["積極"],"successful":["成功"],"line":["主軸"],"convenience":["便利"],"normal":["正常"],"trillion":["兆"],"deteriorating":["惡化"],"movements":["走勢"],"currently":["現時"],"impetus":["動力"],"pressure":["壓力"],"8,000":["8,000"],"launching":["開展"],"supporting":["支持"],"arranged":["安排"],"gains":["回報"],"Supporting":["支持(組合)"],"1.7":["1,700億"],"reduction":["縮減"],"Regarding":[

摘要 2017\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在配合全球經濟擴張的推動下，步伐加快。本地股市上升，住宅物業市場維持其升勢，而房屋可負擔能力收緊。\n\n香港銀行業維持安全穩健，擁有強大的資本和流動性頭寸，以及健康資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港美元對美元回軟，原因是兩地貨幣之間的息差擴闊。然而，公眾對聯匯制度維持高度信心。\n\n貨幣市場繼續有序運作，並擁有充裕的銀行間流動性。香港的基準利率上調75個基點至1.75厘，因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的上升。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局是其監管重點，包括信貸、流動性及科技風險管理。第八輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施推出，以鞏固銀行業在物業市場任何逆轉情況下的韌性。\n\n在政策方面，國際監管標準的本地落實已取得重大進展。解決機制已生效，為銀行體系穩定建立起新的主軸。解決辦公室設立，作為香港金管局努力使解決機制在香港銀行業運作的其中一部分。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n七項新舉措推出，以把握銀行與科技融合所帶來 的龐大機遇，並推動香港成為亞洲的金融科技中心。經一連串網絡建設及能力提升的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升。\n\n香港維持其領先地位於離岸人民幣業務。推出債券通，鞏固香港作為內地機遇的主要門戶。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受益於有利的投資環境，香港交換基金達到紀錄新高的投資收入2,640億港元，為7.4%的投資回報率。\n\n投資多元化持續進行，特別透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。自2009年成立以來，LTGP呈現年化內部收益率13.7%。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳媒、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道與社區及市場保持溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局持續加強企業管治，透過支持員工的專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律及加強資訊科技安全，以應付因落實新舉措及工作日益繁重所引起的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally

經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟協調擴張的背景下，香港在2017年經濟增長加快，勞工市場狀況收緊，通脹壓力保持平穩。預計2018年的經濟增長將維持紥實。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在更協調的全球經濟擴張下，香港經濟在2017年增長加快。實際本地生產總值（GDP）上升至3.8%，較2016年的2.1%增長和過去10年約3%的長期增長（圖1和表1）較高。本地需求回升，私人消費增長加快，總體投資支出回升。更強勁的本地需求反映了有利的就業狀況和收入狀況，資產價格上漲以及改善的商譽。外圍方面，由於全球貿易流量加快步伐，香港的商品出口擴展加快；由於暢旺的貿易和貨物流量以及提升的入境旅遊業，服務出口有所復甦。商品進口錄得更強勁的增長，受出口帶動的擴張需求影響，服務進口則在本地居民旅遊興趣在...下穩步上升。從淨值來看，總貿易盈餘收窄，對GDP增長產生負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，香港美元匯率一般較美元回軟，主要由於港元與美元之間的利率差，以及在...下，利率套利活動推動了這情況。這反映了聯匯制度按照其設計正常運作。雖然香港銀行間利率仍處於相對低水平，但由於新股發行相關的資金需求及銀行年底流動性所需，2017年底香港美元利率面對較大的升勢壓力。就信貸增長而言，經過兩年單位數增長後，2017年總銀行貸款上升了16.1%，增速顯著加快，反映經濟狀況提升及金融市場情緒正面。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸發放標準並無鬆動跡象，整體貸款質素仍然好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在2017年整個期間仍然良好控制（圖2）。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，核心通脹率下降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%為低。特別是，物價指數中的房屋組成項目上升的步伐放緩，反映2016年新簽訂私人住宅租金增幅放緩的滲透效果。大致而言，在強勁的產出增長下，名義工資及收入較溫和的增加有助於遏抑本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦屬溫和，與香港主要資料來源地低通脹情況一致，儘管美元轉弱。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年勞動市場在高於趨勢的經濟增長下收緊。季節性調整後的失業率從2016年的3.4%跌至2017年底的2.9%，為近20年的首時間低於3%（圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門錄得各自的失業率回落，其中零售、金融及專業及商業服務部門的下降更為明顯。隨著總就業人數加快增長，以及私人部門空缺增加，整體勞動需求繼續鞏固。勞動力也擴展，部分反映年長員工（55歲及以上）更積極的參與。在勞動市場收緊及通脹下限的狀況下，實質工資及收入見到更快的增加。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市在2017年幾乎沒有中斷地上漲。恆生指數上升36%，為自2010年（圖4）以來的最大年度漲幅。這波漲勢反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並部分支撐自內地投資者透過股票互聯互通帶來的重大資金流入。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底仍然處於高水平。平均每日成交額擴展至港幣883億，較前一年的港幣669億有所上升，而本地市場提升的總股本資金亦上升至港幣5814億，較一年前的港幣4901億有所增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持升勢（圖4）。交易量由一年前的54,701宗擴展至61,591宗，而房屋價格在2017年上升了14.8%。房屋負擔能力持續挑戰，樓價與收入比率為16.4，較1997年的高位更高，而收入負擔比率則為74.1，遠高於其長期平均水平。1 鑒於樓價上升以及銀行間按揭業務的競爭越趨激烈，金管局在5月推出第八輪審慎措施，以鞏固銀行風險管理和保障銀行體系穩定。這些措施之後，房屋價格增長短暫放緩，隨後在第4季加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，交易活動在該年顯著上升，交易價值和量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報率較去年微升。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2018年的經濟增長會持續強勁。政府預測增長幅度為3至4%，而私人機構分析師則預計經濟將以平均3.2%的速度擴大。外圍方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受惠於全球增長前景的改善以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦。在本地方面，私人消費增長預計將保持穩定，主要受益於有利的勞工市場狀況。至於固定資本形成，建築及建設活動應在住宅供應上升及持續的基礎設施項目推動下穩步進展。雖然改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升可能帶來阻力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在全球溫和通脹及本地成本穩定上升的情況下，預計香港2018年的通脹壓力將維持溫和，但通脹率相信會由2017年的低位逐步回升。例如，通脹的租金組成項目或於2018年下半年因新簽訂私人住宅租金的上升而增強升勢。市場共識預測2018年的標題通脹率將維持在仍然溫和的2.2%，而政府預測核心通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、擴大中的建築及建造活動，以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦，預計將在近期內保持勞動力市場偏緊。私人機構分析師預測2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景在不明朗因素和風險的**前提下**，**包括**與主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定**相關**的風險，**以及**保護主義情緒**升溫**和地緣政治緊張**狀況**的**惡化**。**特別**是，如果這些風險**觸發**資金流動的**逆轉**，**香港**的貨幣**狀況****可能**比預期**加快**地**收緊**，**構成**對實體經濟和資產價格的下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的**前景**仍然**不明朗**。在**短期**內，**現時****有利**的國內經濟**狀況**、被認為的房屋短缺、**低**按揭利率以及**其他**房屋融資來源（**包括****地產商**提供的按揭貸款和來自家長的財政支持），**會****繼續**支持物業需求。然而，**近期**全球金融市場的**拋售****可能會****拖累**市場情緒。從**長遠**來看，房地產市場**繼續****面對**多項**阻力**。**特別**是，隨著美國貨幣政策**繼續**正常化，國內按揭利率**最終****會****上升**。**此外**，在政府**努力**增加土地和住宅供應的同時，預計房屋供需差距**會****逐步****收窄**，這**會****緩和**房價的**升勢壓力**。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n香港銀行業在2017年繼續保持安全穩健，儘管全球經濟存在不明朗因素。獲授權機構（AIs）的資本和流動性狀況仍然強，資產質素維持在健康水平，而盈利能力則因利息差額上升及強勁的信貸增長而改善。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化繼續，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的一個月及三個月期拆息分別上升了49個基點及39個基點。然而，在第四季觀察到明顯的上升。然而，以綜合利率反映的零售銀行港元資金成本，在該年仍然大致平穩（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n整體香港零售銀行辦事處的稅前營運利潤在2017年增長了15.8%。 改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）和手續費及佣金收入增加（+9.4%）。然而，這些增加部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下跌（-29.9%）和經營支出增長（+8.4%）所抵銷。 由於2016年錄得的特定非經常性項目，零售銀行的稅後利潤下跌了18.1%。 零售銀行的稅後平均資產回報率從2016年的1.44%降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差由2016年的1.32%擴闊至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，由2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然手續費和佣金收入上升了9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生產品業務的收入則下跌了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比下降至2017年的41.9%，較2016年的43.2%有所下降，原因是營運成本（+8.4%）上升速度放緩，低於營運收入（+11.8%）（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減損費用下降至73億港元，較2016年的8億港元減少。\n\n#

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管對香港貨幣匯率的壓力有所減弱，香港的匯率及貨幣市場繼續以有序的方式運作，並擁有充裕的流動性。 聯匯制度一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支撐，並展現出高度抗衝擊能力，以應對各種衝擊。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣的外部匯率，以對美元的外匯市場匯率計，在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內保持平穩。貨幣體系的特點是採用貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，並要求貨幣基礎的相應變動與美元儲備的相應變動完全一致。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務證書，提供十足擔保予三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣\n- 政府發行的紙幣和硬幣流通\n- 整體餘額，即銀行存放在香港金融管理局的結算賬戶餘額總和\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局堅決承諾履行可兌換承諾 (CUs) 來維持。當對香港美元的需求更大於供應，且市場匯率轉強至強方可兌換承諾的7.75美元兌一美元時，香港金融管理局準備好沽出香港美元換取美元。整體結餘將隨之擴大，推高香港美元利率，創造貨幣狀況使香港美元舉動離開強方上限，並維持在7.75至7.85的可兌換範圍內。反之，若香港美元的供應大於需求，且市場匯率轉弱至弱方可兌換承諾的7.85美元兌一美元時，香港金融管理局將從銀行購入香港美元。整體結餘將隨之收縮，推高香港美元利率，使香港美元舉動離開弱方上限，並維持在可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2017 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n香港美元匯率在2017年一般見到壓力（圖1）。主要在港元與美元利率息差擴闊在...下，因利息套現活動而推動，港元對美元逐步回軟，從1月3日的7.7566跌至8月22日的年低7.8265。在9月下旬至11月上旬期間，港元匯率錄得一定強大，因新股提供（IPO）相關資金需求而收緊港元流動性，並在7.80至7.81的窄幅範圍內穩步交易。年底時，港元再次出現壓力，部分反映港元流動性狀況改善，以及年底商業對美元需求上升。總體而言，港元匯率市場在2017年整個期間運作正常。\n\n由於CUs並未被觸發，整體結餘及未償還外匯基金票據總額在2017年約為港幣1,225.3億（圖2），無大變動。當年，香港金融管理局發行了總額為港幣80億增發的外匯基金票據，以應對銀行對流動性管理需求的上升。這導致整體結餘在2017年底減少至港幣179.8億。增發外匯基金票據在聯繫金幣制原則下進行，因為這僅代表貨幣基礎組成的改變，從整體結餘轉移至未償還外匯基金票據。貨幣基礎仍然全面由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港美元銀行同业利率在2017年首八個月仍然偏軟，其後面對更多升勢壓力，直至年底（圖3）。儘管有對美國聯邦儲備局加息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，香港美元銀行同业利率在首八個月一般仍然偏軟。因此，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在1月至8月期間擴闊。從9月起，短債香港美元銀行同业利率出現顯著回升，主要受新股集資活動及年底資金需求推動。相應地，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在短債範疇收窄。總體而言，2017年短債銀行同业利率主要低於基準利率。\n\n基準利率分別於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，總計上調75個基點，由1.00%調高至1.75厘，原因是美國聯邦基金利率的目標範圍在當年三次上調共75個基點，由0.50至0.75%調高至1.25至1.50%。基準利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的修訂公式進行，該公式規定基準利率設立於美國聯邦基金利率現行目標範圍下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息率（HIBORs）五日移動平均數的平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，港元期貨點數的貼現於首三個季度逐步擴闊，12個月港元期貨點數在9月中達到約-615點（圖4）。在第4季，港元期貨點數的貼現微升，與港元與美元息差的負息差收窄同步。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行間流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗口貸款額由2016年的5.3億港元上升至2017年的10.3億港元。\n\n# 聯匯制度\n\n自一九八三年設立以來，聯匯制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支柱，並在一連串區域及全球金融危機中展現了高度的韌性。政府重申對聯匯制度的十足承諾，其承諾的可信度亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而得到進一步強化。公眾對港元作為支付手段及保值工具的信心持續強勁。在二零一七年與香港的第四條項諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織重申對聯匯制度的支持，並評論指出聯匯制度仍然是香港的最佳匯率安排。合併穩健的金融監管、謹慎的財政管理及靈活的市場，聯匯制度合作良好，有助於香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯匯制度對香港而言，維持最佳的安排。」\n\n穩健的銀行體系對LERS（聯繫匯率制度）的正常運作至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業貸款、與物業相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管，以增強銀行業的韌性。隨著美國聯邦儲備系統繼續正常化貨幣政策，香港美元利率將逐步正常化。香港金融管理局重申，根據LERS的設計，資本外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方貨幣單位（CU）以及貨幣基礎的縮減，都是港元利率正常化的必要過程。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並做好準備應對潛在的金融波動。\n\n為加強貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的交換基金資產分配用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率，定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎，於2017年內維持在106.7–108.2%的範圍內，未曾觸及上限或下限觸發點。該比率於12月31日收市為108.1%（圖5）。根據LERS，雖然已指定特定交換基金資產用以支持相關投資組合，但所有交換基金資產均可使用以支持港元匯率。若發生突發衝擊，交換基金龐大的財政資源將提供強大的後盾，以保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（CBC）是外匯基金諮詢委員會下屬的委員會，負責監察及審核與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。在2017年，CBC 審議了多個議題，包括香港樓價短期動態的影響因素、香港銀行業拆息率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行業拆息率（LIBOR）息差的決定因素、內地物業估值變動對企業貸款的影響，以及按揭債務服務負擔對香港私人消費的影響。CBC就這些議題的討論紀錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，已公布於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n香港金融研究機構（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年來，HKIMR 更加強調其活動與政策的相關性，特別體現在其會議活動和訪問學者計畫中。HKIMR與主要央行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的會議。同時，2016年推出的主題研究學者計畫，持續支持與香港金融管理局（HKMA）認為重要的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了18位研究學者，並公布了29篇研究論文。該中心當年舉辦了四項國際會議及工作坊：\n- 第八輪年度國際中國經濟會議，題為「中國經濟再平衡：將往何處？」，於1月在香港舉行。該會議提供了一個論壇，讓學者、政策制定者及業界專家討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析及政策議題。共有11篇高品質的研究論文發表，涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革及國際溢出效應等議題，亦包括人民幣匯率及內地貨幣政策框架與傳導機制。\n- 香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）第十五屆夏季工作坊於7月舉行。該工作坊旨在提供一個機會，讓HKIMR及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的成員展示他們的論文，並提升研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）與國際清算銀行聯合舉辦的會議，題為「匯率的價格、實質與金融影響」，於8月舉行。該會議提供了一個平台，進行深入且具見地的討論，涵蓋匯率制度、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備積累過程中的風險採取，以及外匯市場的行為。\n- 由香港金融管理局（HKMA）、美國聯邦儲備理事會及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合贊助的會議，主題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗汲取」，於10月舉行。該會議檢討了過去十年主要央行所採取的非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗與教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興市場的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟及金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out

銀行業穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局繼續將重點放在授權機構風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，以鞏固銀行業應對物業市場逆轉的能力。隨著網絡威脅上升，香港金融管理局加強了對授權機構技術風險管理的監督。同時，香港金融管理局推出了七項舉措，預備香港邁入智能銀行的新紀元。授權機構反洗錢及反恐融資控制的成效，仍然是香港金融管理局監管的重點，作為其打擊金融犯罪的努力。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局採取進一步努力，推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容，並解決中小企業及新創企業在香港開立及維持銀行賬戶時所遇到的困難。同時亦提升了對授權機構投資及保險產品銷售的監督，以進一步鞏固客戶保障。\n\n在國際監管及會計標準的本地落實方面，取得了重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨平穩資金比率、大額風險敞口限制、恢復計劃及國際財務報告準則第9號。為支持在不斷變化的銀行環境和演進的風險生態下，對能力建設的需求，香港金融管理局協調行業發展董事賦權計劃及提升銀行從業員的勝任能力框架。\n\n《金融機構（處理）條例》於2017年7月7日開始運作，使香港成為少數金融穩定理事會成員地區之一，擁有全面跨部門金融機構解決機制。該條例旨在強化金融穩定的主軸，賦予貨幣管理局必要權力，以有序方式管理金融機構在可能對金融體系造成潛在不利影響的情況下的失敗。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的一項目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。此目標的實現取決於金融體系具備強大的承受衝擊能力，並能提供香港經濟所需 的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可以透過其經營業務的方式影響系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，若以混亂的方式失敗，亦會對系統穩定性造成影響。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在確保銀行具備強大的承受衝擊能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位方面，發揮關鍵地位，這最終有助於避免失敗。貨幣管理局肩負在香港監管銀行業務的審慎監督責任，其中包括採取存款的業務。其負責在香港核准持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構共同稱為核准機構（AIs）。貨幣管理局亦負責指定及監督特定金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法保證，亦非香港審慎監管框架設計用以保證零風險金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為解決機構，致力於確保在認可機構出現故障的事件中，解決措施可 以有序地進行，以維持認可機構向其顧客提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港金融機構的解決機制已設立，根據該機制，貨幣管理局為認可機構及其他金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了192項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括持牌機構（AIs）的CAMEL評分1、公司治理、業務運作及風險管理。作為HKMA持續推動持牌機構更強勁風險治理的一部分，HKMA與持牌機構董事會或董事層委員會舉辦了30次會議，討論集中於重要的風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監察其近期公司治理指引的採用情況。此外，亦舉行了27次的三方會議，由HKMA、持牌機構及其外部核數師參與。\n\n除場外活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續進行常規的現場檢查，並輔以針對評估風險較高的地區的主題審查。這種方法容許香港金融管理局優先配置監管資源，重點關注金融機構所面對的新興及顯著風險。香港金融管理局在這一年內進行了401次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理與控制仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一重點是科技風險及營運風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加了海外檢查的數字，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制的現場檢查和主題審查的數字。此外，專門團隊亦對金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險監督\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總銀行貸款增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%增長。根據表2所載，貸款增長是廣泛的。\n\n具體而言，內地相關貸款截至2017年底增長17.5%，達到4,188億港元（表3）。其中包括644億港元，這些貸款已入帳至在香港註冊成立並在內地設有子公司的銀行。\n\nAIs的資產品質在2017年仍然健康。零售銀行的不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%下降至2017年底的0.54%，亦低於自2000年以來長期歷史平均值2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，不良貸款比率從0.85%下降至0.67%。就與內地相關的貸款而言，零售銀行的此類貸款不良貸款比率在2017年從0.82%下降至0.75%。就整個銀行業而言，此比率則從一年前的0.80%下降至0.67%。\n\n在該年，香港金融管理局加強了監管努力，以保證金融機構繼續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，對金融機構對主要企業的風險敞口進行了提升監測。進行了針對性的主題檢查，重點關注信貸風險管理的關鍵控制措施，例如貸款審批標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及對地產商貸款、資產擔保融資和保險費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n物業價格於2017年繼續上升。有更多由授權機構（AIs）提供的貸款，涉及有多重按揭或收入主要來自香港以外的借款人。鑒於這些發展，香港金融管理局於5月19日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高授權機構為新的住宅按揭貸款計算資本充足率的風險加權底線，降低適用於已存在按揭的借款人的物業按揭貸款的貸款成數上限，以及降低適用於主要來自香港以外地區的借款人的物業按揭貸款的債務償還比率上限。\n\n香港金融管理局自2009年起推出的物業按揭貸款的宏觀審慎措施，提升了銀行對房地產業市場相關風險的抗風險能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）在12月跌至49%，較2009年9月的64%下降，當時逆周期措施首次推出前的水平。平均負債收入比率（DSR）亦下降至12月35%，較2010年8月的41%下降，當時首次應用了DSR的上限（圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局見到一些地產商以高槓桿為其物業發展項目提供資金，並有部分地產商向物業買家提供高LTV比率的按揭。為解決這些發展項目所涉及的風險，香港金融管理局於5月12日推出新風險管理措施，適用於向地產商貸款。這些措施包括要求銀行機構降低建築融資的融資上限；要求銀行機構為其向地產商的貸款，特別是按揭貸款相對於股東權益比例較高的貸款，設立更多資本準備；以及進行一輪主題審查，以保證銀行在向地產商的貸款中繼續跟進謹慎的貸款標準。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局與土地註冊處合作開展e-Alert服務，於2月。該e-Alert服務提供通知給相關認可機構，當有關按揭物業的進一步按揭登記就此方面提交至土地註冊處進行登記時，讓按揭銀行能採取適當的風險緩衝措施。\n\n# 運營及科技風險的監督\n\n網絡安全威脅在當年持續上升。香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了監管努力，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為香港金融管理局於2016年推出的網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）的一部分，30間銀行完成了對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。另一方面，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）在與銀行及證券業進行廣泛諮詢後，聯合決定推出網上股份交易強制雙重驗證。一輪專注於銀行網絡安全控制及營運韌性的現場檢查亦有進行。香港金融管理局進一步與主要銀行的高層管理人員進行了一輪討論，以評估銀行如何管理潛在新市場參與者因科技推動而帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n9月，香港金融管理局宣布一項措施組合，協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行的新紀元。在監管方面，香港金融管理局提升金融科技監管沙盒至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行及科技公司均可使用的聊天室設施，以及在香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會及保險業監管局之間設立連結，以便提供一個單一入口，用以進行跨行業金融科技產品的試驗。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出了「Banking Made Easy」計劃，旨在識別及減低監管摩擦，以提升顧客使用金融科技及網上銀行服務的經驗。現時，一個工作小組已設立，重點關注遠程開戶及帳戶維護、網上金融及網上財富管理。\n\n現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的審討已經展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n\n# 庫務活動監控與流動性風險\n\n隨著我們繼續恢復正常貨幣政策，全球資金流動性可能會日益波動。鑒此，香港金管局在當年重點關注流動風險的監管。香港金管局亦提升了其監管流動性壓力測試，加入了增發情景，包括一個更具壓力但合理的資金流出情景，以及一個短期、信心驅動的銀行擠兌情景。香港金管局加強了對個別AIs的流動性狀況的監察與分析，並規定部分AIs鞏固其流動風險管理能力。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行更多針對持牌機構（AIs）債務證券組合的市場風險管理現場審查。一輪主題審查已進行，以評估持牌機構（AIs）在境外貨幣債券投資活動上升所導致的潛在風險，並評估相應風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖措施。\n\n# 防範洗錢及資助恐怖主義（ML\/TF）\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》2017年6月23日刊憲，並將於2018年開始運作。此項修訂旨在根據金融行動特別工作組（FATF）所頒佈的最新國際要求，更新香港的反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）監管制度。這些更新，連同AML\/CFT法定指引的更新，將幫助釐清及落實以風險為本的客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序，用於開設賬戶及維護誠實顧客，並在這些程序遙距進行時，鼓勵創新。\n"}

Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力於提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新措施旨在促進銀行及支付行業金融科技的發展和使用，亦受到持份者的好評。經一連串網絡建設和能力建設的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象亦進一步提升。債券通的推出進一步鞏固了香港作為通往內地機遇的主要門戶的地位。香港金融管理局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力也開始見到成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑒於快速的科技發展，香港金融管理局於9月宣布推出七項舉措，以預備香港邁向智慧銀行的新紀元。這些舉措包括：\n- 開展快速支付系統（FPS），以實現數碼零售支付的完全連繫；\n- 推出開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才發展；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行的推出；以及\n- 推動簡政便民銀行倡議，以減低顧客數碼體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融科技促進辦公室 (FFO)，一同與香港金融管理局的銀行部門發揮樞紐地位，推動這些措施的落實，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象得到進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的成員數字增長至87個，而創辦時約為40間。在當年，IFFO舉辦並參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，以促進持份者之間的經驗分享及合作聯繫。特別是，IFFO推動了在首屆債務融資與投資者圓桌會議上，基礎設施股本投資參考協議範本的發展，旨在加強基礎設施項目之可貸性和投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於7月推出，標誌香港與內地資本市場相互接軌的另一重要里程碑，進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。當年，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度上升至5,000億元人民幣，從原先的2,700億元人民幣。香港維持全球最大離岸人民幣流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動暢旺，這體現在本港人民幣即時全額結算（RTGS）系統交易量創下新高，以及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據最大股份。\n\n繼2016年推出企業財資中心（CTCs）稅制後，香港金融管理局加強其外展努力，以吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立企業財資中心。至2017年底，超過40%的企業告知香港金融管理局，他們正積極計劃設立，或已設立企業財資中心業務。\n\n香港金融管理局積極貢獻於國際討論，議題對全球及區域金融穩定具有重要性。香港金融管理局行政總裁於4月擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，以領導有關關鍵金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及快捷運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位奠定了紥實的根基。2017年，四宗銀行間即時轉賬系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）取得100%系統可用性，較目標的99.95%為高。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已設立賬戶，與兩間內地中央證券登記結算機構（CSDs）合作，以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表有關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為推動本地零售支付業界的 一般 效率與安全，金管局於 8月 指定 4宗 零售支付系統 (RPSs) 於《支付條例》下，將其營運納入金管局的 監督。金管局 亦 進行 對 16 間 儲值支付工具 (SVF) 發牌機構的監督，這些機構 積極 推出 新產品及服務，旨在 帶來 更多 選擇予 顧客，並提供 理想 的用戶 經驗。 另一方面，電子支票 及 電子帳單呈現及支付 (EBPP) 服務的 覆蓋 範圍進一步 擴展，以 包含 香港與全部 廣東省 的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港在亞洲金融科技方面中心\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n鑒於科技的快速發展，香港金管局於9月宣布了七項舉措，旨在幫助香港預備進入智慧銀行的新紀元。這些舉措旨在幫助銀行業提升至較高水平，並把握科技與銀行融合所帶來龐大的機遇。\n\n智慧銀行將帶來零售和企業顧客之間十足的互相連繫，並允許金融服務和交易以高度的流動性、速度、便捷性和安全性執行。\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界及金融科技社群密切工作，並在實施七項倡議方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 加快支付系統\n\n快速支付系統是一個多幣種平台，會讓公眾能夠使用手機號碼或電郵地址，輕鬆地全天候進行實時資金轉賬。該系統可支援以港幣及人民幣進行支付。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與快速支付系統，讓所有支付參與者之間建立緊密聯繫。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，快速支付系統預定於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個工作小組，成員包括主要信用卡發卡機構、銀行、持牌儲值支付工具發牌機構及商戶收單機構，以建立香港零售支付的通用二維碼標準。通用二維碼標準會促進商戶使用單一二維碼接受來自多個支付服務提供者的二維碼支付方案，為顧客和商戶提供更大的便利。這個工作小組已最終確定有關的技術規格，並且會落實安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API 讓銀行數據可供第三方存取，以促進銀行及其他行業服務的整合。用戶因此可方便地在 一 個系統上享受 安全 的服務，並在安全環境中操作。為促進銀行業對開放API 的發展與採用，香港金融管理局已擬訂開放API 架構草案，內容包括 選擇 的開放API 職能、部署 時間 框架、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、促進 措施及維護模式，以供為期 兩 個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n一項主要的研究項目是關於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年首份DLT白皮書之後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月公布。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三項概念驗證工作，即貿易融資、數字身分管理及房貸申請。它亦提供意見，說明於銀行及支付產業部署DLT時，與治理、法律合規及一般控制原則相關的落實問題。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳 Norman 先生宣布於香港金融管理局金融科技日發表有關區塊鏈技術的第二份白皮書。\n\n憑藉香港金融管理局領導的貿易融資概念驗證工作的成功，香港七間銀行決定將原型系統商業化，建立名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）的生產系統，以數位化並分享貿易文件，自動化流程，旨在提升整體貿易流程，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險與詐欺。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出金融科技職業加速計劃。學生的呼應是正面。收到超過3,000份申請，來自421名申請人。最後，74名學生接受實習機會，與香港金融管理局及12間銀行合作，自7月起進行與金融科技相關的專案，持續6個月或1年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區內合作的第一步，我們正與深圳合作推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽訂協議，將（i）為金融科技公司提供相互的軟著陸支持；（ii）於10月共同舉辦深圳-香港金融科技獎，以表彰和獎勵兩地出色的金融科技產品及解決方案；以及（iii）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融公司進行暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳諾文先生（中），在香港金融管理局金融科技日上簽署並交換關於軟落地安排的諒解備忘錄，與中國銀行保險監督管理委員會總監何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席李 George  李博士。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎電子傳單。\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融管理局簽訂金融科技合作協議，就創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊分享及專業知識交流等方面展開合作。\n\n在11月，香港金融管理局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署了解備忘錄，聯合建立全球貿易連繫網絡（GTCN），該網絡會將新加坡國家貿易平台連接到香港貿易通平台，以便數字化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、快捷且具成本效益。它將是一個開放平台，允許其他地區未來參與。GTCN預計將於2019年首季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年9月推出的FSS已升級至FSS 2.0，以促進與銀行及科技公司的溝通，推動新想法和新計劃。繼此，FSS 2.0具有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，以便在金融科技項目的早期階段向銀行和科技公司提供意見。\n- 科技公司可以透過聊天室尋求意見，而無需通過銀行即可進入FSS。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）和保險業監理機構的沙盒已聯匯，使跨行業金融科技產品的試驗有單一進入點。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS已測試28款新科技產品。其中14宗試點試驗已完成，有關產品隨後已推出至市場。\n\n# 銀行取得輕鬆倡議\n\n一項「銀行輕鬆辦理」倡議已推出，旨在減低阻礙科技創新的監管阻力。一項專責小組已設立，現時重點關注以下地區：\n- 遠程客戶入職及戶口維護\n- 網上金融\n- 網上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行，未有實體分行，預期將提供動力以推動金融科技在香港的應用，並帶來新型客戶體驗於流動及數碼銀行服務。它們亦有助於推動金融包容，因它們通常針對零售領域，無論是個人或中小企業 (SMEs)。香港金融管理局已啟動對現有虛擬銀行授權指引的檢討，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的推出。\n\n# 智能銀行的新紀元\n\n#

Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

儲備管理\n\n全球經濟及金融市場在2017年表現優於預期。全球股市造好，受益於主要發達及新興市場經濟體同步增長、強勁的企業盈利，以及市場預期主要央行會逐步收緊貨幣政策。雖然美國聯邦儲備局如預期般提升利率三次，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表，但10年期美國國債收益率仍然平穩，美元對其他主要貨幣不…反而回落。在這樣有利的環境下，儲備基金的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下紀錄新高，為投資回報率7.4%。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》訂立，外匯基金的主要目標是影響香港貨幣的匯率，無論是直接或間接。基金亦可動用以保持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，幫助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，投資於財政司司長認為適當的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n金融管理局制定了以下投資目標予外匯基金：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 保證在任何時候，全部的貨幣基礎均全面支持於流通性極高的美元資產；\n(c) 保證足夠的流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 在前提下，根據 (a) 至 (c)，爭取投資回報以幫助保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了交易所基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置之中。\n\n大致而言，發行基金有兩大資產組合：後補組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。後補組合（BP）持有高度流通性極高的美元計價資產，以提供十足後補，符合貨幣基礎在貨幣局制度下的規定。投資組合（IP）則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國家的債券及股權市場，以保障資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升長期回報，香港金融管理局已在謹慎且循序漸進的方式下，將部分匯兌基金的投資分散到多元化的資產類別中，包括新興市場及內地的債券和股票、私募股權及房地產。新興市場及內地的債券和股票歸屬於投資工具計劃，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）管理。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）下投資的市場價值上限設立於匯兌基金累積盈餘的三分之一，而未來基金的一部分撥款用於長期資產，將產生額外容量。\n\n為策略投資組合，於2007年設立，以持有香港交易所結算有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府代表交易所基金購入，用於策略目的，由於此投資組合的獨特性質，故未將其包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 存款與香港金融管理局基金\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。利率一般掛鉤於IP1的表現，但未來基金則視乎投資組合的配置，其利率與IP及LTGP掛鉤。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為65：35。預期未來基金與LTGP掛鉤的部分將逐步增加至2018年約50%。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n匯基金的投資過程以兩類資產分布的決定為基礎：戰略性資產分布和戰術性資產分布。戰略性資產分布反映於投資基準，代表匯基金投資目標的長期最佳資產分布，鑑於此。在戰略性分布的指導下，資產會策略性地選持，以爭取在基準之上取得額外回報。這意味著實際的分布往往與基準或戰略性分布不同。實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰術性偏離」。雖然基準和追蹤誤差限額由財政司司長與匯金局金融穩定委員會（EFAC）協商後定出，但戰術性決定及容許的戰術性偏離範圍則由香港金融管理局在授權下制定。在容許的戰術性偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可以選持以利用短期市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）儲備管理部門直接管理約73%的外匯基金投資，其中包括全部的BP和部分IP。這部分IP包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多個實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具對沖投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n此外，香港金融管理局除內部管理資產外，亦僱用外部基金經理管理約27%的交易所基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產類別。僱用外部經理的目的是運用市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以取得可持續的回報，從多樣且互補的投資方式中受惠，並與交易所基金分享市場見解及技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅費。此支出主要由市場因素定出，且每年可能不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n全球金融危機後，金融市場的波動性達到新高，突顯了風險管理的重要性。為內部及外部管理的投資組合，已設立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監察對指引和法規的遵守情況。風險評估已加強，以支持匯兌基金投資多元化的步伐。風險控制工具被採用，以在正常及不利市場狀況下評估市場風險。詳細的績效歸因分析亦進行，以識別績效來源，使香港金融管理局能最佳地使用內部及外部經理的投資技能。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任投資。例如，香港金融管理局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發行《負責任擁有權原則》，該原則屬自願性質，有助投資者釐定如何最好地應對其在香港上市公司的投資責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，香港金融管理局已鼓勵其香港股票投資組合中指定的外部基金經理採用《負責任擁有權原則》。此外，前線部門及風險管理及合規部已將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入多個內部程序，以制定和監察投資活動。香港金融管理局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n# 2017年金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟和金融市場表現理想。在主要發達國家和新興市場經濟體同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將逐步收緊貨幣政策的背景下，全球股市表現亦佳。特別是香港股市上升了36%，優於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場，短週期美國國債收益率因美國聯邦儲備系統如預期般提升利率三次，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表而飆升。然而，全年來，10年期美國國債收益率仍然平穩於約2.4%。其他主要10年期政府債券收益率亦不大變動，例外的是德國國債，因歐元範疇的紥實經濟增長以及市場對歐洲央行政策收緊的預期而上升。\n\n在貨幣市場上，美元對其他主要貨幣回落，儘管美國聯邦儲備局的加息以及其資產負債表縮減開始。美元的下跌造成了歐洲和日本經濟回升，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策收窄。 歐元和日圓分別對美元在2017年升值約14%和4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣及債券和股票市場的表現如表1所載。\n\n表 1 2017 年市場回報\n\n# 聯匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金錄得2017年投資收入2,640億港元。 其中，海外股票錄得804億港元回報，香港股票錄得583億港元回報，債券錄得344億港元回報。此外，非香港元資產的正面估值上調帶來535億港元回報，而外匯基金投資控股附屬機構持有的其他投資則錄得374億港元回報。 另一方面，戰略投資組合錄得45億港元估值回報。\n\n去年香港基金的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下新高，高出2007年的紀錄（1,422億港元）1,218億港元。\n\n證券交易所基金的總資產在年底達 HK$40,153 億。長期投資計劃 (LTGP) 下的投資總值為 HK$2,356 億，其中私人股權總值為 HK$1,572 億，不動產為 HK$784 億。未償還的投資承諾總值為 HK$162.4 億。\n\n於2017年，交易所基金的投資回報（不包括策略組合）為7.4%。具體而言，IP取得12.1%的回報，而BP錄得1.8%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP錄得年化內部回報率13.7%。\n\n香港外匯基金自1994年至2017年的年度回報載於圖1。表2顯示了2017年的投資回報以及基金在多個不同年期內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年的平均回報為2.5%，過去十年的平均回報為2.2%，自1994年起的平均回報為4.9%。表3顯示基金資產截至31日12月2017年的貨幣組成。\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁余偉文（中）先生在2017年外匯基金記者會上發言。\n\n圖1

The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the

企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。 過去的一年，金管局繼續加強企業管治，支持員工的專業發展，嚴格控制財務紀律，並加強資訊科技保安，以應付因落實新措施及工作繁重程度增加而產生的挑戰。\n\n# 聯繫社區 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒密切合作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及工作的了解。2017年，共舉辦了86場開放式傳媒活動，包括九場記者會、十六場場面對面訪問及61場其他公開活動。此外，安排了42次傳媒訪問，並發行了共360份雙語新聞發佈稿。亦每日常處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升各界對香港金融管理局（HKMA）主要職能的認識，金融管理局舉辦了媒體導覽活動，讓媒體參觀全新翻新的HKMA資訊中心。此外，亦為本地及海外媒體進行深入的媒體簡報及教育工作坊，內容包括債券通計劃、按揭貸款的審慎措施、解決機制及外匯基金投資等廣泛主題。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德銘先生於香港金融管理局資訊中心向傳媒推出一幅名為「小改變，大頌歌」的馬賽克藝術作品。該藝術作品以維多利亞港及香港天際線為主題，並使用總共135,811枚不同面額的香港硬幣締造而成。\n\n香港金融管理局首席執行官陳諾文先生與本地報章進行媒體專訪，就香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室的重點措施進行介紹。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務提供了一個有效途徑，讓公眾更能了解香港金融管理局（HKMA）的主要職能和運作。二零一七年共處理了8,752宗查詢，其中約一半涉及銀行政策與法規、貨幣及經濟問題、消費者銀行業務，以及紙幣和硬幣等事宜。值得注意的例子包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函、貨幣及經濟統計數據、樓宇按揭貸款的審慎措施，以及防止洗錢和恐怖主義融資等。\n\n圖1顯示自2014年收到的公眾查詢數字，圖2提供2017年收到查詢的性質分解。\n\n圖 1 公眾查詢\n\n圖2 2017年諮詢性質\n\n# 刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，2017年香港金融管理局公布了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告及4宗季度通訊，並定期更新每月統計通訊，以提供最新的、主題性的關於香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的資訊及分析。此外，香港金融管理局發行了共23篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的多個議題。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過六萬頁的英文及繁體與簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維持的獲授權金融機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs的證券從業人員登記冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》維持的儲值支付工具（SVF）牌照持有人登記冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷聯網，以引起公眾對香港金融管理局新舉措的關注，例如開戶程序、儲值支付工具的監管制度、基礎建設融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室，以及重要且及時的資訊，例如提醒公眾需保持警惕，以防假冒電話詐騙，以及「硬幣收集計劃」下硬幣推車的設置位置。\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心設於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向公眾介紹香港金融管理局工作，並推動社會對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心設有展覽範疇及圖書館，並於每週開放六天。展覽範疇介紹香港金融管理局的工作以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展情況，亦提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展覽供公眾研究。\n\n資訊中心政策專區的新面貌，推出香港金融管理局的工作及相關金融概念，於2017年2月24日完成翻新工程後重新啟用。翻新後的政策專區設有多個互動遊戲和裝置，將趣味融入學習，並以簡單的方式解釋複雜的金融概念。訪客的意見正面。\n\n學生在資訊中心的政策專區試玩教育遊戲，了解香港金融管理局的工作。\n\n資訊中心為訪客舉辦導覽團。本年度，資訊中心接待了超過59,000名遊客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過650場導覽團（圖3）。自2003年12月啟用以來，已有超過645,000名市民造訪資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁邊，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，供研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行主題之用。根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，圖書館亦維持持牌金融機構及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及持牌金融機構的證券從業人員登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心內的圖書館。\n\n為接觸社區並提升市民對香港金融管理局工作的認識，香港金融管理局於2017年舉辦4宗公眾教育講座，約有2,000名中學生及教師參與。講座主題包括聯匯匯率制度、香港紙幣、銀行體系穩定、消費者保護、存款保障計劃、金融科技、一帶一路及金融行業職業發展。自1998年該公眾教育計劃推出以來，已有超過58,400名市民參與。\n\n不同區的中學學生與教師參與一場公開教育研討會。\n\n圖3 2017年資訊中心團體參觀類別\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）招募、發展及維持一支高度專業的人才隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對變動的工作優先次序。雖然金管局是政府的重要**部分**，但它**僱用**員工的**以...計**方式與公務員制度**不同**，以**吸引**具備**經驗**和專業知識的人員。作為一個公眾**機構**，金管局旨在**保持**精簡和靈活的架構，並在可行情況下，重新調配員工資源以**應對****增加**的工作量。\n\n# 組織變動\n\n決議辦公室於2017年4月1日設立，以落實2016年6月頒布的《金融機構（決議）條例》。該辦公室旨在保證香港的決議機制能為銀行運作。這對於加強香港銀行業在任何危機情況下的韌性至關重要。\n\n# 人力配置\n\n2017年香港金融管理局的設立為927。此數字將於2018年增加35%至962（3.8%的上升），以保證提供足夠資源，應付新舉措及現有工作的繁重。新職位採用於下列職能：\n\n加強銀行及金融穩定，包括：\n– 加強支持推出加快支付系統及簡易銀行服務的措施；\n– 提升監管能力，應對銀行在區域及業務上的擴張，並促進（一）在銀行服務提供中更廣泛地採用金融科技，以及（二）與其他監管機構在網絡安全及金融科技問題上合作；及\n– 支持欺詐及洗錢情報工作組的工作，以打擊欺詐、洗錢及其他類別的金融犯罪，並加強法規執行行動在反洗錢及虛擬資產基金相關法規下的法律支持。\n加強投資、風險管理及其他相關的支持，以推動交易所基金投資活動的進一步擴張和多元化。\n確保金管局擁有必要的人才資源，以應對機構的長期發展所需，因此需要加強全球宏觀及金融部門的監測，並提升人才發展計劃。\n\n表1說明了香港金融管理局的設立及強大。\n\n表1 香港金融管理局於2018年1月1日的設立及強大\n\n臨時資源被調派以應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局亦會調派職員到其他國際或本地機構進行借調，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）和金融服務發展局，以協助香港或金管局有興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分職員以全職或兼職形式被調派，為香港存款保障局和財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據發行基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）的意見，並考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及強積金計劃，實物福利極少。現金薪酬包包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，浮動薪酬可能根據表現，每年以一次性形式發放給個別成員。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬由財務匯報局（FS）每年檢討，並參考財務委員會（EFAC）向其提出的建議。財務委員會（GSC）會評估香港金融管理局在過去一年的工作表現，以及由獨立人力資源顧問機構為金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，並考慮其他任何有關因素。為保持薪酬的競爭力，或會不時對工作表現優秀的成員進行特別薪酬調整。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬調整及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的浮動薪酬發放，均根據個人表現發放予各成員。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員在浮動薪酬制度的

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

交易所基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師的報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審核交易所基金及其子公司（「集團」）的財務報表，載於第157至243頁，包括交易所基金及集團於2017年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該年終結的收入支出賬戶、綜合收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括顯著會計政策概要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表反映基金及本集團於2017年12月31日的財務地位，以及截至該年終結的財務表現和現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會發行的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」），妥為編製，且已根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官指示取得。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我按照最高行政長官根據《流通資金條例》第7條所作的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行了審計。我在這些標準下的責任，進一步說明於我的報告中「審計財務報表的審計師責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與集團保持獨立，並已按照這些標準履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我取得的審計證據足夠且適當，可作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我的專業判斷下，於2017年12月31日終結的財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在審計財務報表整體的情況下處理的，並用以形成我的意見，我並未就此提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局肩負其他資訊的責任。其他資訊包括香港金融管理局2017年年度報告中所載的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師對此的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不包括其他資訊，我並未就此表示任何形式的意見。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，考慮該資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不符，或否則顯著失實。 根據我所進行的工作，如果我認為該資訊存在重大錯誤，我規定需要報告該事實。 在此方面，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 金融管理局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計委員會的財務報表責任\n\n貨幣管理局肩負編製財務報表的責任，該等財務報表須真實且公平地表達，並按照香港會計師公會發行的香港財務報告準則，以及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條制定的指示編製，並為貨幣管理局認為必要以確保財務報表無重大錯誤陳述的內部控制措施，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並在適用情況下披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及使用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會肩負監督集團財務報告流程的責任。\n\n# 審計師在審計財務報表方面的責任。\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認整體財務報表是否免於重大錯誤陳述，無論是因舞弊或錯誤引起，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，總是能夠發現已存在的重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，並且如果個別或整體來看，可能合理地影響基於這些財務報表的用戶所做的經濟決定，則被考慮為重大。\n\n作為審計委員會審計準則的審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n- 識別並評估財務報表中可能存在的重大錯報風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行適當的審計程序，以取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我意見的依據。因詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或動用內部控制，因此未能發現因詐欺導致的重大錯報的風險，較因錯誤導致的風險為高；\n- 了解與審計有關的內部控制，以便設計適當的審計程序，但此舉並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣當局所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及其會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或狀況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，或若這些披露不充分，則須修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或狀況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈報、結構及內容，包括相關的披露，並評估財務報表是否以達到公允呈報的方式，反映其底層交易和事件；以及\n- 取得有關集團內實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且適當的審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我肩負集團審計的指導、監督及執行責任。我單憑自身對審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我與交易所基金顧問委員會的審計委員會就審計範圍和時間安排等事項進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何顯著內部控制重大缺陷，以及其他顯著的審計結果。\n\n我亦提供給交易所基金諮詢委員會審計委員會一份聲明，證明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，提供相關保障。\n\n根據與交易所基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會的溝通，我釐定在本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，並因此成為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項可能造成的負面影響會超過公開溝通所帶來的公共利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛\n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n貨幣管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金控制人所授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定，管理外匯基金。該基金的主要職能是維持香港貨幣的兌換價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：Backing Portfolio、Investment Portfolio、長期增長 Portfolio 以及 Strategic Portfolio。Backing Portfolio 的資產全面匹配香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。Investment Portfolio 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長 Portfolio 持有私募股權及房地產投資。Strategic Portfolio 持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府購入，為基金的策略目的之用。運作範疇資訊載於附註 30。\n\n# 二 顯著會計政策\n\n# 2.1% 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係按照所有適用之香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，該準則為一集體名稱，包括所有適用之個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港特許會計師學會（HKICPA）發行的解釋，以及在香港一般公認的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）採用之顯著會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行特定的新版及修訂版香港財務報告準則，這些準則於現時會計期間首次生效或可供提前採用。附註3提供有關會計政策如有任何變更的資訊，這些變更源自首次採用這些發展，且與集團反映於這些財務報表中的現時及以往會計期間有關。\n\n# 2.2% 財務報表編製之基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司和合資企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要業務所載於附註十六和十七。\n\n財務報表編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除下列資產及負債按其公允價值呈現外，其他均按歷史成本計量：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.11）；以及\n- 投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告數額。這些估計和相關假設是根據經驗和多個其他因素而定，這些因素在當時情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成了對帳面價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值從其他資料來源中並不顯而易見。實際結果可能與這些估計有所差異。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續檢討。修訂會計估計若僅影響該期，則於該期認可；若修訂影響現時及未來期，則於修訂期及未來期認可。\n\n附註18包含有關投資物業公允價值估計的相關假設。附註36包含有關金融工具公允價值估計的相關假設。除涉及這些公允價值估計的會計判斷外，本集團應用會計政策沒有其他重要的會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3% 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團控制一家實體，當其因參與該實體而有權獲得浮動回報，並且擁有透過其對該實體的實力影響這些回報的能力。在評估集團是否擁有實力時，僅考慮集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。\n"}
