{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"\"Capital

貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石。\n\n自1983年起實施的聯繫匯率制度（聯繫匯率制度）幫助香港度過了眾多挑戰和衝擊，體現了其作為香港經濟繁榮的基石，以及香港作為國際金融中心的地位。儘管當年面對複雜的外部和內部環境，聯匯制度仍順利有序地運作，再次證明其在不確定時期的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦保持穩健。事實說明一切：港元匯率持續穩定，並在最近幾個月強勢位於可兌換區間強方，而銀行存款在當年亦持續增長。總而言之，並未觀察到港元或銀行體系出現明顯的資金流出。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行體系的穩定，不僅反映了我們體系的強韌性，也體現了對我們體系的強大信心。這並非一蹴而就，而是通過多年努力建立緩衝機制及加強監測，並配合我們對社交媒體平台上謠言的迅速回應，以及運用環球銀行金融電信協會(SWIFT)等工具。\n\n多年來我們為不測風暴所做的準備，已為香港的貨幣和銀行體系奠定了堅實的基礎和強大的緩衝能力。除了公帑中龐大的外匯儲備，我們的銀行體系亦擁有強健的資本緩衝、充足的流動性及非常優良的資產質素，無論以國際或歷史標準衡量均屬優秀。自2009年起實施的八輪針對物業按揭的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，亦大大增強了銀行對物業市場下行風險的應對能力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監管是我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們亦不時加強監察及監管架構。除了密切監察銀行的信用及流動性風險外，今年我們的新工作重點是運用從銀行收集的科技及細粒度數據，以更深入及及時的方式提升監測港元資金流向及金融市場活動的能力。同時，亦根據快速演變的經濟及營運環境，加強了壓力測試及應變規劃。\n\n事實上，我們堅實的監管制度已獲得國際上的強烈認可。今年內，國際貨幣基金組織重申，香港憑藉其充足的緩衝措施，具備良好條件應對週期性和結構性變化。香港在打擊洗錢和恐怖主義融資方面的有效法律框架，亦獲得財務行動特別組織（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太地區首個在財務行動特別組織的相互評估中取得總體符合標準結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，對維護貨幣和金融穩定至關重要。為維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能對香港貨幣或銀行體系構成疑慮的惡意謠言保持高度警惕，並迅速作出回應。尤其在社交媒體和即時通訊工具普及的今天，此點更為重要。在社會動盪期間，製造恐慌的人曾在社交媒體平台上散播各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速且清晰地澄清這些謠言，證明能有效澄清事實、阻止虛假信息進一步傳播，並維護國際社會和公眾對我等體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱。\n\n銀行體系，作為經濟活動的重要支柱，在確保社會和經濟的順利運作中扮演著根本性的角色。儘管自下半年以來營運環境充滿挑戰，各銀行與其他機構並肩努力，竭盡所能維持其核心功能的正常運作，並持續服務企業和公眾。\n\n除了基本銀行服務，例如存款和轉帳外，銀行的一項重要功能是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們充分了解並關注企業，特別是中小企，在經濟下行時期所面臨的現金流問題。在維護銀行體系穩定性的前提下，我們已推出多項舉措，以確保持續向中小企提供資金支持。具體而言，銀行的逆周期緩衝資本比率於2019年10月和2020年3月兩次調低，總計150個基點至1.0%；銀行監管儲備水平亦於2020年4月減半。 這些措施釋放約港元1萬億的借貸空間，為銀行提供更多向企業（包括中小企）提供貸款的空間。我們也成立了一個平台——銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，匯集香港主要銀行，共同探討加強對中小企資金支持的具體措施。我很高興看到許多銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，為有需要的客戶推出紓緩措施，例如暫緩還款，協助他們渡過難關。\n\n鑑於一些中小企業反映開設銀行帳戶存在困難，而開戶正是接觸各種銀行服務的第一步，我們在過去幾年來一直致力解決這個問題。我們的工作已取得成效，企業開戶情況有所改善。為進一步推動普及金融，金管局率先推出分層帳戶服務——簡易帳戶（SBAs），採用簡化的客戶盡職審查程序，為新創企業和中小企業提供傳統銀行帳戶以外的選擇。截至目前為止，已開設超過2,800個簡易帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上\n\n我們始終銘記需要在監管與發展之間取得合理的平衡。鑑於國際金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其長期穩定。重點工作有四方面：科技、綠色金融、與內地互聯互通以及人才發展。\n\n# 在數位時代擁抱科技\n\n香港自2016年成立金融科技促進辦公室及2017年推出智慧銀行計劃以來，積極推動金融科技發展，進展迅速。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的蓬勃發展，體現在快速支付系統「轉數快」的強勁發展勢頭。這項全球首個跨銀行、跨多種貨幣及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台，在短短15個月內已註冊四百萬用戶，於750萬人口中顯示出高滲透率。政府亦已採用「轉數快」，為公眾提供繳納稅款、差餉及水費的更大便利。預期越來越多的企業會使用這項快速、安全和便捷的收付款方式，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行體系中，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務運作方面已取得顯著進展。根據金管局進行的一項研究，近90%的受訪零售銀行已採用或計劃採用人工智能於其業務應用中。在金管局的推動下，銀行已將大數據及消費者行為分析應用於其個人信貸產品中。他們亦已在前兩階段推出了超過800個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋銀行產品及服務範疇。雖然鼓勵銀行應用金融科技，我們亦沒有忽略加強數字銀行服務中科技風險管理及消費者保障的需要。有關方面已及時向銀行提供監管指引。\n\n合規科技（Regtech）是銀行界極具興趣的另一個領域，因其潛力可讓銀行更有效率且具成本效益地進行監管合規及風險管理，尤其是在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界對合規科技的採用，並推動合規科技生態圈的發展，金管局（HKMA）於上月舉辦了首屆打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）合規科技論壇，並發布了第一期合規科技電子通訊，以探討合規科技的潛在應用範例。同時，作為銀行業監管機構，金管局正探索應用監管科技（Suptech），包括新興的數據科學與分析技術，以提升工作效能與效率。我們已開展一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年實施監管科技的路線圖。\n\n從更宏觀的角度來看，這僅僅是銀行體系金融科技發展的開端。金管局在今年授予了八間虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行於2020年3月正式推出服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行則透過金管局的金融科技監管沙盒展開試行。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及更多創新和多元化的銀行服務引入香港，從而提升我們銀行體系的全球競爭力。\n\n更多令人振奮的發展也預期將在國際層面出現。在成功完成概念驗證，將我們的基於區塊鏈的貿易融資平台貿易聯動與其歐洲對應平台連接後，我們正與中國人民銀行進行另一項概念驗證，為跨境貿易的數位化創造條件。我們已與泰國中央銀行啟動一項聯合研究項目，以探討央行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際結算銀行亦於十一月在香港設立創新樞紐中心，以促進中央銀行界別的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地證明了香港在金融科技發展領域的領先全球地位。\n\n# 推動綠色及永續金融，共創美好未來\n\n近年來，與氣候相關的風險已引起越來越多的全球關注。為響應全球努力應對這項挑戰，金管局於五月份公布了三項重點措施，以不同方式推動香港發展綠色金融。\n\n作為銀行業監管機構，金管局正採取三階段方式推廣綠色和可持續銀行業。第一階段已制定評估銀行綠色程度的框架，現正向業界諮詢，為第二階段制定監管期望及要求，以及第三階段的實施奠定基礎。\n\n作為外匯基金的管理機構，金管局積極推動負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入投資活動中。具體而言，若綠色及ESG投資的長期回報與其他投資在經風險調整後相較，我們會優先考慮進行綠色及ESG投資。自2015年作為早期投資者進入綠色債券市場後，我們將繼續擴展綠色債券組合，並投資於其他ESG資產。我們亦會與志同道合的投資者及監管機構合作，透過參與ESG社群中的國際組織，推動ESG的最佳實踐。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年因全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易緊張局勢及本地社會事件而趨於軟化，同時勞工市場面臨日益增加的壓力。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健及韌性，擁有強勁的資本狀況、充足的流動性以及良好的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管面對充滿挑戰的外部和內部環境，香港的貨幣體系依然穩固，這從港元匯率的穩定以及外匯和貨幣市場的順暢運作可見一斑。這不僅反映香港貨幣體系的穩健性，也體現了對香港貨幣體系的信心。\n\n金管局更新了流動資金安排架構，並引入了一項新的處置資金安排，同時作出多項優化。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局致力監察銀行信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行體系穩定。在推廣智慧銀行方面亦取得良好進展，包括發出八個虛擬銀行牌照，並鼓勵採用合規科技。這些努力亦配合加強對銀行科技風險管理的監管，以及提升數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n金管局簡化投資者保護措施，以改善顧客體驗，同時促進以客為本的銀行文化。\n\n香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）獲得財務行動特別組織（FATF）正面評價，使其成為亞太地區首個在FATF第四輪相互評估中展現整體合規表現的特別組織成員地區。\n\n新的規則和法規將陸續推出，以加強銀行體系監管制度，符合最新的國際標準。香港宣布採取三階段方法，推動綠色及可持續銀行業，為全球應對氣候變化作出貢獻。\n\n同時，金管局在落實銀行處置機制方面取得了重大進展，特別是推動具本地系統重要性銀行（D-SIB）建立新的吸收虧損能力層級，以促進金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港的金融科技生態系統正加速發展，銀行體系內開放應用程式介面框架的推行取得良好進展，全球首個國際結算銀行創新樞紐中心已成功成立，同時電子支付中使用快速支付系統「轉數快」的應用持續擴大。\n\n香港穩居全球離岸人民幣業務的樞紐地位。在粵港澳大灣區發展的背景下，與內地互聯互通不斷加強，香港居民使用金融服務也變得更加便捷。\n\n為進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，正致力於開拓新的機會，特別是在基建投資融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金方面。\n\n金融學院成立，旨在匯聚點，培育金融業領袖人才，並作為貨幣與金融研究的知識庫，包括應用研究。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受益於有利的投資環境，外匯基金實現歷史第二高的投資收益，達港元2622億元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n金管局持續推動投資組多元化，尤以長期增長組合（LTGP）為重。自2009年啟動以來，LTGP的內部回報率年率達12.6%。在推動負責任投資方面亦有令人鼓舞的進展。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會大眾及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的理解。\n\n在機構內，金管局非常重視維持企業管治，透過支持員工專業發展、實施嚴謹的財政紀律及提升資訊科技保安，以應對新措施推行及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n"}

junior translators' attempts. All translations correctly use \"認可機構\" for \"AIs\" and \"Authorized institutions.\" The core issue lies in the phrasing around \"grace period,\" \"large exposures,\" and \"connected party exposures.\"\n**General Observations:**\n*   **Formality:** All translations are reasonably formal, appropriate for regulatory language.\n*   **Fluency:** Some are more fluent than others. The use of \"緩衝期\" (buffer period) is a good alternative to \"寬限期\" (grace period) in some contexts, but not consistently applied.\n*   **Vocabulary:** The translations of \"large exposures\" and \"connected party exposures\" vary. \"大額風險\" (large amount of risk) and \"關聯方風險\" (related party risk) are common, but \"重大風險敞口\" (significant exposure) and \"關聯方風險敞口\" (related party exposure) are more precise and commonly used in financial regulations.\n*   **Grammar:** Generally sound, but some sentences are slightly clunky.\n**Specific Evaluation:**\n*   **Translator 1:** \"大型風險及關聯方風險的限度\" is a bit awkward. \"限度\" (limit) feels tacked on.\n*   **Translator 2:** \"獲准享有\" is slightly more formal than necessary. \"對大額風險承擔及關聯方風險承擔的限制\" is repetitive.\n*   **Translator 3:** \"關連人士風險\" is less common than \"關聯方風險.\" \"有關\" is unnecessary.\n*   **Translator 4:** Using quotation marks around the rules and code is stylistically correct and improves readability. \"在…方面享有\" is a bit wordy.\n*   **Translator 5 & 6:** Using \"緩衝期\" is a good choice, and \"重大風險敞口\" and \"關聯方風險敞口\" are the most accurate translations for the exposure terms. \"落實\" (implement) is a good verb choice.\n**Improvements & Best Approach:**\nThe best translation should combine the strengths of several options. I will prioritize:\n1.  Using quotation marks for the rules and code.\n2.  Employing \"緩衝期\" for \"grace period\" as it conveys a sense of a temporary allowance.\n3.  Using \"重大風險敞口\" and \"關聯方風險敞口\" for the exposure terms.\n4.  Streamlining the sentence structure for better flow.\n5.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年出現收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易摩擦及本地社會事件。隨著年下半年經濟狀況迅速惡化，勞工市場面臨日益增加的壓力。通脹亦因豬肉價格急劇上升而增加。預計2020年經濟表現將持續面臨挑戰，新型冠狀病毒爆發對本已疲弱的經濟造成衝擊。鑒於艱難的經濟環境，政府與金管局已推出措施支持經濟，特別是家庭及中小企。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n繼2018年擴張2.9%後，香港經濟在2019年收縮1.2%，為自2009年以來首次出現年度收縮。尤其是在下半年，經濟陷入衰退，經季節調整後的本地生產總值（本地生產總值）連續在第二、第三和第四季下降（圖1）。經濟活動的下滑反映了本地需求顯著減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件對消費活動和營商氣氛造成重大影響，私人消費支出錄得自2003年以來首次年度下降。整體投資支出也因營商氣氛疲弱而下降。在對外方面，全球經濟增長放緩以及中美貿易緊張局勢下施加的額外關稅導致香港的貨品出口下降。服務輸出也創下歷史上最大的年度跌幅，因為社會事件導致訪港旅遊業嚴重惡化。由於本地需求和再出口誘發的需求較小，貨品進口及服務輸入也進一步下降。從淨出口（貿易順差）來看，淨出口在2019年對本地生產總值產生了積極貢獻（圖1），因為總進口下降的速度比總出口更快。\n\n鑑於強勁的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間推出多輪措施，以緩解居民的財政負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企以及受衝擊較大的行業，如零售、飲食服務、運輸及旅遊業。為讓銀行能更支持本地經濟並協助緩解經濟週期，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆周期緩衝資本比率由2.5%降至2.0%，從而為銀行提供更多靈活性，釋放港元200至300億元的銀行貸款予包括中小企在內的企業，並同時建立銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。此外，中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）於9月推出新的八成信貸擔保產品，允許現金流量減弱的中小企借款人申請本金寬限期，以獲得即時支援。進一步地，SFGS於12月推出新的九成信貸擔保產品，為中小企、業務經驗較少的企業，以及希望開設私人實踐的專業人士提供額外的融資支援。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n港元匯率及貨幣市場於2019年順利有序地運作。全年，港元匯率大致穩定。由於弱方兌換保證於3月觸發，金管局以港元7.85\/美元1的匯率向銀行購入港元及售出美元，總結餘隨聯繫匯率制度的設計而減少。銀行同業拆息長端維持大致穩定，而短端利率則普遍上揚。在零售層面，數間零售銀行於10月下旬將最優惠貸款利率調低12.5個基點，反映美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的調整。至於貨幣總體數字，總貸款於2019年增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%為高，總存款則在該年度增長2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n基礎通脹率，扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，於2019年微升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%略高。通脹溫和上升，主要受惠於自5月起鮮豬肉供應中斷導致的豬肉價格上漲（圖2）。排除基本食品項目後，全年價格壓力維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費物價指數的租金組成項目有所緩和，與私人住宅新租約較早的綜合趨勢同步。更廣泛而言，名義工資的溫和增長以及商業租金增長速度放緩，有助於控制本地企業成本。外部方面，進口物價通脹有所緩和，與香港主要進口來源地的通脹下降以及全球經濟增長放緩的背景一致。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2019年上半年大致保持韌性，但下半年面臨日益增加的壓力（圖表3）。失業率在頭兩個季度維持在多年來的低點2.8%後，經季節調整後，第三季上升至2.9%，第四季則上升至3.3%，其中消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率因社會事件而顯著上升。整體勞動需求在年後期明顯減少，總就業人數及私人部門職位空缺均下降。勞動需求減少尤其體現在零售、住宿及飲食服務業，以及進出口貿易和建造業。在供給方面，勞動人口參與率略有下降，部分原因是對經濟衰退的週期性反應。隨著勞工市場承受更大壓力，名義工資及收入的增長在年底出現放緩跡象。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了劇烈的波動。在首四個月市場上漲後，由於對中美貿易緊張局勢再升級的擔憂，恒生指數在五月份急跌（見圖4）。儘管六月份在主要中央銀行釋出更寬鬆貨幣政策的信號下有所回升，但由於全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件，股價再次承壓。年末，隨著美國與中國內地達成「第一階段」貿易協議，股價重新獲得上升動力。恒生指數全年收於28,190點，全年上漲9.1%。相比之下，平均每日成交額較去年同期下降約19%。一家主要內地科技公司及一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，有助於通過首次公開招股集資總額在2019年達到3142億港元。香港在2019年連續第二年在全球首次公開招股集資總額中排名第一。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2019年前五個月出現強勁反彈，但其餘月份則普遍回落。年初市場情緒有所改善，部分原因是中美貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時緩和，但隨後因中美貿易局勢再度升級、持續的社會事件以及疲弱的本地經濟狀況而受到影響。總體而言，樓價從五月份的高峰期至十二月溫和下跌了5%，但由於首五個月反彈了10%，全年仍錄得5%的增長（見圖4）。2019年的交易量較前一年增加4%，達到59,797個單位，反映了年初的活躍交易活動。置業負擔能力仍然緊張，價收入比和收入槓桿比率分別維持在17.9和80.9的高位，遠高於其長期平均水平。為協助有即時置業需求的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司於十月中旬提高了按揭保險計劃下，符合按揭貸款條件的已落成住宅物業價值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面臨更強的下行壓力。特別是，零售店面的價格和租金均錄得了自2008年全球金融危機以來的最大跌幅，反映了當年惡化的經營環境。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港的經濟表現預期於2020年將面臨嚴峻挑戰，並伴隨與冠狀病毒爆發相關的顯著下行風險。零售、住宿、餐飲服務、旅遊和交通等尚未從社會事件造成的影響中復甦的行業，將會遭受雙重打擊。然而，在2020至21年度《財政預算案》中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性派發現金以及在中小企融資擔保計劃下提供政府百分百擔保的特惠低息貸款，預料將為經濟提供一定支持，特別是家庭和中小企業。於2020年3月16日，金管局進一步將銀行的逆周期緩衝資本比率從2.0%降低至1.0%，這將有助於銀行更積極地支持本地經濟，特別是預料因冠狀病毒爆發的影響而面臨額外短期壓力的行業和個人。按本地生產總值組成部分分析，由於消費者和企業信心脆弱，私人消費和投資可能仍然疲軟。雖然政府消費將有助於經濟增長，但公共投資支出預計會相對緩慢，原因是部分大型基建項目已告完成。在對外方面，「第一階段」美國與中國內地之間的貿易協議被評估為對本地經濟在短期內略有正面影響。然而，香港的對外貿易表現將繼續受到全球經濟增長和貿易流量疲弱的影響。特別是，冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區內供應鏈運作受阻，以及跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，從而制約香港的出口。政府預測2020年實質本地生產總值增長介於-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織和私營機構分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n2020年通脹壓力預期將會緩和，原因在於經濟狀況不佳、私人住宅租賃市場的整合以及溫和的進口通脹。市場共識預測2020年的整體通脹率為1.8%，政府則預計整體及基本通脹率分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞工市場方面，由於經濟前景疲弱及冠狀病毒爆發，失業率在短期內可能進一步上升。私營部門分析員預期2020年的失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n二零二零年的經濟前景黯淡，並受到多項不明朗因素及風險的影響，包括全球經濟放緩、中美貿易關係、內地經濟表現、本地社會事件以及冠狀病毒爆發持續存在的影響。特別是，持續的冠狀病毒爆發可能引發更明顯的全球經濟放緩及資產重新定價，由此產生的不利宏觀經濟環境及較為緊縮的金融條件，進一步對國內實體經濟活動造成下行壓力。然而，主要央行更為積極地放寬貨幣政策，或可緩解疫情對經濟造成的負面影響。\n\n# 銀行體系的表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2019年表現出韌性，儘管面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張局勢和本地社會事件等嚴峻環境。銀行資產負債表走勢穩定，貸款和存款均溫和增長。銀行體系的資本和流動性狀況保持穩健，資產質素亦能維持良好水準。銀行體系保持盈利，平均資產回報率亦保持穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council.

貨幣穩定\n\n2019年香港美元匯率及貨幣市場運作順暢有序。全年香港美元匯率保持穩定，並在年底走強至可兌換範圍的強方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港的貨幣政策首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣相對於美元的匯率，在外匯市場上維持在港元7.75至7.85兌1美元的區間內。 貨幣體系結構的特徵是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表 1），包括：\n\n負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供充分的擔保。\n\n政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣的總結餘，即銀行存放在金管局的結算戶口的結餘。\n\n金管局代表政府發行外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n港元的匯率穩定是透過自動利率調節機制，以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證（CUs）來維持。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方兌換保證匯率（港元7.75兌1美元）時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求出售港元以換取美元。總結餘隨後會擴大，以壓低港元利率，創造貨幣狀況，使港元遠離強方上限，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換保證區域內。相反地，如果港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方兌換保證匯率（港元7.85兌1美元）時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求買入港元。總結餘隨後會收縮，以推高港元利率，使港元遠離弱方下限，並維持在兌換保證區域內。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，以及本地經濟放緩，港元在2019年仍保持穩定，匯率交投順暢有序。年初時，港元與美元的負利率差擴大，吸引了套息活動，即沽售港元以換取美元，使港元匯率接近弱方兌換保證匯率7.85（圖1）。隨後，隨著港元匯率持續走弱，三月期間弱方兌換保證匯率被觸發八次。其後，港元持續維持在7.85的弱方兌換保證匯率附近。自五月底起，由於規模龐大的新股集資活動、企業的派息以及半年結算，強勁的港元需求促使港元走強。雖然年中後港元匯率一度回落，但自十月底起，港元重新獲得動力，並在年末維持在兌換保證匯率的強方水平。這部分反映了股票相關港元需求，包括首次公開招股，以及因年底流動性收緊而導致的港元短倉交易平倉。總體而言，2019年港元匯率市場運作正常。\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證匯率，總結餘（貼現窗前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2018年底的港幣1,136.2億元下降至2019年底的港幣1,133.0億元（圖2）。當年，金管局根據聯匯制度的設計，應銀行要求，在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平下購入合共港幣22.1億元，導致總結餘（貼現窗前）由2018年底的港幣76.4億元收縮至2019年底的港幣54.3億元。當年，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額小幅上升，由港幣1,059.8億元增至港幣1,078.7億元，反映根據既定慣例發行相關票據以償還利息。貨幣基礎整體仍完全由外匯儲備支持。截至2019年底，總結餘（貼現窗前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為港幣1,133億元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2019年，港元銀行同業拆息長端大致維持穩定，而短端利率則普遍上升（圖3）。短端利率亦因新股集資活動相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需求而出現更多波動。自2018年4月以來總結餘的減少，可能使港元銀行同業拆息對本地市場港元資金供求變動的反應更加敏銳。\n\n基本利率於2018年12月底為2.75%，在2019年8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共調低75個基點，至同年11月初降至2.00%。此調整反映美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次總計下調75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。在11月18日至26日及12月19日至31日期間，基本利率高於2.00%，反映當年最後兩個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）的隔夜及一個月期利率出現顯著上升趨勢。因此，2019年底基本利率收市為2.49%。基本利率的調整遵循2009年3月26日公佈的修訂公式，該公式規定基本利率為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限高出50個基點，或隔夜及一個月期香港銀行同業拆息五日移動平均值的平均數，以較高者為準。在零售方面，多家零售銀行在10月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調後，將其最優惠貸款利率調低12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期匯率點子的折扣在頭兩個月擴大，隨著港元與美元利率差的變化而有所波動，至二月中旬，12個月期的港元遠期匯率點子達到約-708點（圖4）。其後，隨著港元與美元負利率差的收窄，港元遠期匯率點子的折扣逐漸收窄，並在年底轉為升水。總體而言，香港的貨幣市場運作有序。貼現窗借款額由2018年的港元402億減少至2019年的港元383億。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度在過去三十多年來對香港的貨幣及金融穩定貢獻良多，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其穩健性。在今年發生的社會事件背景下，社交媒體上流傳著一些對聯匯制度及香港金融穩定構成質疑的謠言。金管局迅速且有力地透過傳統媒體及社交媒體駁斥這些謠言，向公眾保證聯匯制度將繼續實施，香港亦不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局亦發佈多篇文章，協助公眾了解聯匯制度的運作、資金流動情況及利率前景。這些努力有效維持了公眾對聯匯制度的信心，全年市場的有序運作可見一斑。政府同樣堅定支持聯匯制度。政府對此承諾的公眾信心，以及港元作為支付手段和價值儲存工具的地位，亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定而進一步加強。在國際貨幣基金組織2019年與香港的第四條磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申其對聯匯制度作為香港金融穩定基石的長期支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是香港合適的貨幣制度，這得益於香港透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟及謹慎的財政架構。\n\n健全的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系高度流動且穩健，流動性水平及資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行體系的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業、樓宇按揭貸款及內地相關貸款的監管。與往年相比，總結餘較為低，銀行普遍已加強其流動性管理安排，並更積極地管理日常資金頭寸。此外，金管局亦持續與銀行保持緊密溝通，以確保市場流動性的順暢迴圈，尤其是在大型首次公開招股的（新股集資）認購期前後及期間。本年度未出現交收阻滯，貼現窗持續有效且高效地運作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將外匯基金資產的特定部分撥作支持貨幣基礎。2019年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.9–112.1%的區間內波動，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。12月31日，該比率收報111.2%（圖表5）。根據聯匯制度，雖然已指定特定的外匯基金資產用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。若發生突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財務資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發行委員會（CBC）監察及審議與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。 2019年，委員會審議了包括針對聯匯制度運作的事件研究方法、總結餘與香港利率之間的關係、對聯匯制度的期權市場觀點採取更完善及靈活的處理方式，以及未來首次公開招股對香港銀行同業拆息的影響等議題。委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交給委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均於金管局網站上發佈。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心），前身為香港金融研究中心，致力於研究貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域的議題，並將研究結果應用於政策制定。這體現在研究中心的研究人員及海外學者所探討的廣泛議題，以及其舉辦的研討會和活動中。研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為重點的研討會。其研究交流項目支持與金管局、香港及該區域相關的政策議題研究。\n\n2019年，研究中心接待了14位研究學者，發表了17篇工作論文，並舉行了11場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。此外，中心還舉辦了三場國際會議。\n\n第10屆中國經濟年度國際研討會，題為「中國的金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由研究中心、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合舉辦。研討會為來自央行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家提供了一個世界級的論壇，討論在金融改革所引致的變化及內地經濟發展背景下，內地金融部門所面臨的風險問題。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

銀行體系穩定\n\n香港銀行體系在2019年保持穩健及穩定，儘管全球及本地經濟持續疲軟。多虧業界的共同努力，銀行體系在社會事件期間持續正常運作。為減輕對公眾造成的不便，已採取相應措施。當年，金管局將監管重點放在認可機構的信貸及流動性風險管理上。隨著網絡威脅不斷升級，以及業界對科技的日益依賴，金管局亦加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，金管局簡化了投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，並保障客戶權益。同時，我們亦加強了對數字金融服務的消費者保護，並持續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著財務行動特別組織對香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的第四輪相互評估完成，評估結果顯示整體符合要求且成效顯著，特別肯定銀行體系對風險的良好理解，以及金管局在AML\/CFT領域推行以風險為本的監管工作。金管局持續參與反詐騙及洗錢情報共享的公私合作計劃，並積極支持銀行體系採用合規科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，金管局於2019年向八間虛擬銀行頒發銀行牌照，並宣布採取三階段方案，以促進香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。金管局一直與銀行業界密切合作，優化監管政策和程序，並推行提升人才專業能力的措施，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，本地工作取得重大進展，推行國際監管標準，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔標準。金管局亦繼續致力確保為認可機構建立可信的處置機制，包括制定有關吸收虧損能力的規定，以提升認可機構的可重整性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的一般目標是促進銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。實現此目標有賴於金融體系具備高度的韌性，並能為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行或會因其業務運作方式，甚至在萬一情況下，因未能有序處理而影響金融系統的穩定性。 金融管理專員作為監管機構，致力維護金融穩定，確保銀行具備應對突擊的能力，並能在危機發生時迅速恢復。 金融管理專員負責對香港的銀行進行審慎監管，包括授權持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及收存公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構 (AIs)。此外，金融管理專員亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基建 (FMIs)。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法確保，香港的審慎監管框架亦未設計用以消除金融體系中的零風險。相反地，作為處置機構，金融管理專員致力於確保，若然認可機構出現經營困難，其相關風險亦可有序處理。為此，香港已建立一套針對金融機構的處置機制，根據該機制，金管局為認可機構的處置權責單位。為確保香港的處置機制能夠有效運作，必須制定相關的處置法規及政策標準，並進行處置規劃，以移除影響認可機構可處置性的障礙，同時提升金管局處理陷入困境的認可機構的能力。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採取國際協調一致的處理方法。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n於2019年，進行了196項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為加強金管局持續推動的風險管治，與認可機構的董事會或董事層級委員會舉行了26次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外部審計師之間還舉行了32次三方會議。\n\n除了離地審核外，金管局定期進行現場審查，並配合對風險較高範疇的專題評估。年內共進行了 405 項現場審查和專題評估。信貸風險管理持續是這些審查和評估的重點，科技風險及營運風險管理亦是另一個主要關注點。為加強流動性及市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的落實，金管局同時增加了相關的現場審查和專題評估。此外，專門團隊亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務的活動進行現場審查和專題評估。\n\n表1呈現了金管局於2019年的總體監管活動概覽。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2019年適度增加。總貸款額增長6.7%，相比2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，在香港使用的貸款和在香港境外使用的貸款分別錄得7.7%和5.8%的增長。\n\n截至2019年底，內地相關貸款增長7.4%至4,564億港元（表3）。\n\n認可機構的資產質素保持健康。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率自2018年底的0.51%下降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年起的長期歷史平均水準2%。就銀行業界整體而言，特定分類貸款比率上升至0.57%，從0.55%。就內地相關貸款而言，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率自2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，但仍低於歷史水平。就銀行業界整體而言，該比率上升至0.75%，較一年前的0.55%為高。\n\n年內，金管局加強了監管工作，以確保認可機構在不確定的經濟環境下持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。償債壓力測試已得到強化，以涵蓋更全面的風險範疇及採用更嚴峻的壓力假設。強化後的壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端衝擊。為評估認可機構在不同領域的信貸風險管理實務，金管局進行了有針對性及主題性的審查，例如向從事高風險業務的企業貸款、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行及財富管理客戶提供的有抵押貸款。鑒於中小企在經濟下行期間較容易面臨更大挑戰，金管局於十月設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，旨在鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則所允許的範圍內，持續支持中小企的融資需求。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n香港銀行業對物業市場下行的抗風險能力，因金管局自2009年起推行的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施而顯著增強。新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，在2009年9月首次推行逆周期措施後，降至2019年12月的53%，較當時的64%明顯下降。新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率，亦在2010年8月首次實施供款與入息比率上限後，由41%降至2019年12月的36%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監督\n\n金管局採用三階段方式，在網絡防衛計劃下實施網絡防衛評估框架。第一階段評估，涵蓋所有主要銀行，已於2018年完成。第二及第三階段涵蓋的認可機構已基本按計劃完成評估。金管局亦已著手全面檢討網絡防衛計劃，以根據過去幾年的經驗對該計劃進行微調。\n\n十月，金管局發佈了修訂版的《監管政策手冊》(SPM) 模組，主題為「電子銀行風險管理」。此次修訂旨在為業界提供更大的靈活性，以應對客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。金管局同時發佈了一套高層原則，就人工智能的使用提供指引，以為業界參考。\n\n自六月社會事件爆發以來，金管局一直與銀行業界保持密切對話，以監察事件對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機的現金，並盡快修復遭破壞的設施。金管局亦迅速採取行動，反駁企圖削弱公眾對銀行體系信心的惡意謠言。由於銀行業界的共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施迅速恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的不便亦降至最低。鑒於社會事件帶來的營運風險不斷上升，銀行被要求採取額外的預防措施，以加強營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險管理的監督\n\n在本年度內，金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。 評估重點為認可機構流動性壓力測試計劃的穩健性，以及應急融資管理。金管局亦評估認可機構在計算流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）方面是否符合相關監管要求，以確保用於計算的數據的謹慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著程式交易在銀行業界日益普及，金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構在這方面的風險管理實踐。鑒於倫敦銀行同業拆息（倫敦銀行同業拆息）可能在2021年底後停止發佈，金管局提醒認可機構提前做好轉向備用參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查，以監測它們的準備情況。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐融資（ML\/TF）\n\n金管局根據風險為本的監管原則，監督認可機構的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）。本年度進行了18次現場審查及61次非現場評估，其中包括針對私人銀行業務及新科技應用治理的專題評估。金管局與業界分享了有關認可機構應用風險為本的監控措施於中小企業的專題評估所得的觀察結果及最佳實踐，以協助其採用適當的企業開戶程序及相關服務。\n\n# 財務行動特別組織（FATF）相互評估報告：香港\n\n2019年金管局及香港整體打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的一大亮點，是9月發表的財務行動特別組織相互評估報告。該報告代表了財務行動特別組織第四輪對其成員管轄地區進行相互評估以來的最佳整體成績之一。在香港的評估中，其打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的成效評分中，11項即時成效項目中有6項獲得重大評級，且在相互評估的技術合規方面獲得高分。\n\n報告對金管局以風險為本的方法監督打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度（AML\/CFT）表示滿意，指出金管局對銀行體系內的洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險有良好的理解，對儲值支付工具（SVF）行業的風險亦有合理的認識。報告亦正面評價銀行體系在AML\/CFT方面的集體努力，例如較大型認可機構增加使用數據分析，絕大多數可疑交易報告均由認可機構提交，以及銀行體系積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）。\n\n報告建議在幾個方面進行改進，包括加深對一些高風險領域的了解，例如境外貪污及稅務罪行，以及發展儲值支付工具等領域。已開始著手處理這些建議；金管局已於七月發布更新的ML\/TF風險評估報告，並已展開針對私人銀行業務及新技術使用的治理的現場審查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last year.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus Caring Organisation

推動金融科技倡議；以及\n透過銀行易計劃進一步推動合規科技的應用。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局的銀行部門共同發揮關鍵作用，推動這些倡議的落實。\n\n香港在協助國際投資者配置人民幣資產方面扮演不可或缺的角色，憑藉滬港通及債券通等互聯互通機制，提供無與倫比的在岸市場通道。過往一年內，債券通的註冊投資者數目及每日成交額均實現三倍增長，充分體現了這一點。債券通及滬港通亦進一步推出優化措施，為國際投資者投資內地境內證券提供更大便利與靈活性。金管局亦與內地當局密切合作，探討並落實一系列金融便利化措施，讓香港居民可更便捷地跨境使用粵港澳大灣區的金融及銀行服務，包括預期的理財通機制。香港穩守全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐地位。根據國際結算銀行（國際結算銀行）三年一度的外匯與衍生工具市場成交額調查，香港繼續為全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n持續努力開拓新機會，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金設立提供更為有利的稅務及監管環境。為推廣香港作為綠色金融樞紐，金管局組織了一系列大型活動及針對性宣傳推廣活動，以促進基建投資及融資，以及企業財資中心（企業財資中心）的發展。為增強香港的軟實力，金融學院（金融學院）於六月成立，致力於培育金融業領袖人才並推動研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行及監管領域，金管局在多個區域及國際委員會中擔任領導角色。金管局曾擔任金融穩定理事會（金融穩定理事會）的監管合作常設委員會（監管合作常設委員會）主席，直至2019年8月31日。目前，金管局正擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的監管及實施準則小組（監管及實施準則小組）主席，並擔任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)下設的金融市場工作小組（金融市場工作小組）主席。此外，金管局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）的非銀行監察專家小組（非銀行監察專家小組）共同主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全高效運作，為香港奠定了穩固的國際金融中心地位。四個銀行間即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易資料儲存庫（HKTR）於2019年實現了100%的系統可用率，超越了99.95%的目標。透過CMU與兩家內地中央證券存管機構設立的賬戶，CMU協助處理債券通北向通交易的結算，並代表有關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」作為香港元RTGS系統的延伸，讓公眾能夠全天候跨銀行及儲值支付工具進行即時零售資金轉帳及支付，在首年運作中表現順利。用戶對此項設施的使用情況穩步上升，截至2019年底已累計四百萬個註冊用戶，交易量亦增至三倍。快速支付系統「轉數快」為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，金管局已指定並監管六個零售支付系統（RPSs）根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）。金管局亦於五月發出兩項新的儲值支付工具牌照，使儲值支付工具持牌人總數達到十八間。儲值支付工具持牌人於本年度繼續積極推出新產品及服務，以增加客戶選擇及提升用戶體驗。\n\n# 二零一九年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行倡議\n\n金管局於2017年9月宣布了七項智慧銀行倡議，旨在協助銀行體系達致更高的運作標準，並把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的巨大機遇。當年，這些倡議的落實工作以及香港金融科技生態系統的轉型均取得了顯著進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統「轉數快」\n\n香港在數碼時代的金融基建發展中，快速支付系統「轉數快」於2018年9月推出，是一個重要的里程碑。快速支付系統「轉數快」進一步推動香港電子支付的應用，為公眾及企業提供高效便捷的支付服務。截至2019年底，參與服務供應商已增加至30間銀行及11個儲值支付工具，新增了九間銀行和一個儲值支付工具。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」的使用量亦持續穩步增長。截至2019年12月31日，該系統已錄得四百萬個註冊用戶（圖1），並處理了4400萬筆交易，總交易金額達港元748.5億及人民幣170億元。2019年12月，日均交易量達168,000筆，涉及港元2.4億及人民幣3800萬元（圖2），較其於2018年10月首個完整運作月份的51,000筆交易顯著增長。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」紀錄：\n- 截至2019年12月31日，註冊用戶達400萬\n- 截至2019年12月31日，交易筆數達4,400萬\n- 2019年12月平均每日交易額為港元24億及人民幣3,800萬，總交易筆數為168,000筆。\n\n金管局與業界合作，將快速支付系統「轉數快」的使用範圍擴展至繳費及其他商戶付款。例如，商戶已可使用多種代理識別碼，並透過QR碼接受部分或超額付款。為方便從商戶手機應用程式啟動手機銀行或儲值支付工具電子錢包應用程式，金管局制定了相關技術規範。此舉將大幅提升客戶透過手機設備使用「轉數快」進行商戶及企業付款的體驗。\n\n金管局亦與相關政府部門緊密合作，協助他們使用快速支付系統「轉數快」收取公眾繳費。由11月1日起，稅務局、差餉物業估價署及水務署發出的賬單均印有「轉數快」的QR碼，方便公眾使用支援的流動銀行或儲值支付工具電子錢包掃描付款。金管局將繼續與各政府部門及公營機構合作，探索其他潛在應用範疇，以方便公眾透過「轉數快」付款。\n\n為提高公眾對轉數快的認識，金管局已開發一系列新的教育及宣傳資料，例如為電視及電台播放的公共利益公告，以及用於數碼平台的視頻及電子橫幅。金管局亦參與展覽會，向中小企及企業推廣轉數快。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具亦發起推廣活動，並提供優惠，以鼓勵客戶註冊使用轉數快，並用其進行資金轉賬及繳付帳單。\n\n此外，金管局邀請了多家業界組織及機構就「轉數快」進行簡報，以介紹其功能以及該系統可能為不同企業在收款及付款方面帶來的潛在效益。\n\n政府已採用快速支付系統「轉數快」以繳納稅款、地租、政府租金及水費。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面（開放API）\n\n<think>\nAll six translations are reasonably good and adhere to the dictionary terms. However, there are subtle differences in fluency and naturalness. Here's a breakdown:\n* **HKMA (金管局):** All translations correctly use 金管局.\n* **banking products and services (銀行產品及服務):** All translations correctly use 銀行產品及服務.\n* **Open API (開放API):** All translations correctly use 開放API.\n* **Open API endpoints (開放API接口):** All translations correctly use 開放API接口.\n* **the banking sector (銀行體系):** All translations correctly use 銀行體系.\n**Strengths Across Translations:** The consistent use of the dictionary terms is a major strength. The sentence structure is generally correct.\n**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**\n* **\"Facilitate\" and \"Promote\":** Several translations use \"促進\" (promote) or \"促成\" (facilitate\/bring about). While not incorrect, \"促進\" feels slightly less precise than \"facilitate\" in this context. \"推動\" (push forward) is another option that could be considered.\n* **\"Adoption\":** The word \"adoption\" is a bit clunky in some translations. While \"採用\" (adopt) is technically correct, it can sound a little formal.\n* **\"Applications\" vs. \"申請\":** Some translations use \"應用程式\" (applications) while others use \"申請\" (application\/request). The original English refers to applications *for* banking products and services, so \"申請\" is more accurate.\n* **Month Formatting:** Some use \"1月\" while others use \"一月\". \"1月\" is more common in formal documents and news reports.\n* **Flow and Sentence Structure:** Some sentences are slightly more convoluted than they need to be. Simplifying the phrasing would improve readability.  For example, the phrasing \"以支援銀行產品及服務的申請\" can be streamlined.\n* **Repetition:** The repeated use of \"開放\" (open) can be slightly monotonous.\n**Best Translation and Reasoning:**\nTranslation #5 is arguably the closest to a perfect translation, using \"推動\" which is a good alternative to \"促進\" and maintaining a good flow. However, I would make a few minor adjustments to improve the overall fluency and naturalness. I would also use \"1月\" for consistency.\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n* Replace \"促進\" with \"推動\" in the first sentence.\n* Streamline \"以支援銀行產品及服務的申請\" to \"為銀行產品及服務申請提供支援\".\n* Use \"1月\" and \"10月\" for month formatting.\n<\/end>\n金管局持續推動銀行體系發展及採用開放API，並按照開放API框架的四階段方法進行。第一階段，20間零售銀行於1月開放超過500個開放API接口，涵蓋銀行產品及服務的資訊。第二階段，銀行於10月開放超過300個API，為銀行產品及服務申請提供支援。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n在貿易融資方面，今年第一季度已完成貿易聯動與we.trade的概念驗證試驗。11月，香港銀行間清算有限公司的子公司與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所簽署諒解備忘錄，進行貿易聯動與人民銀行貿易金融平台的概念驗證試驗，以為香港與中國內地的企業提供更便捷的貿易融資服務。\n\n關於央行數碼貨幣（央行數碼貨幣），金管局與泰國中央銀行啟動了名為Inthanon-LionRock的聯合研究項目，旨在研究央行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用，並促進香港和泰國銀行之間的港幣和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收（外匯交易同步交收）。\n\n金管局金融基建助理總裁彭志豪先生（左起第一位），與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）數字貨幣研究所所長穆長春先生（右起第一位），共同見證香港貿易金融平台有限公司總裁唐慧星女士（左起第二位）與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所副所長兼深圳金融科技研究院院長迪剛先生（右起第二位）簽署諒解備忘錄，以進行貿易聯動與人民銀行貿易金融平台連結的試驗。\n\n在人工智能（AI）方面，金管局進行了一項關於人工智能技術在銀行業界的應用研究。主要結果於十一月發表，隨後於十二月發佈了題為「Reshaping Banking withArtificial Intelligence」的完整報告。\n\n報告《Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence》於十二月發佈。\n\n一份資訊摘要已發布，旨在突出香港銀行業界使用人工智能的關鍵事實和數據，這些數據來自一項調查。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，金管局繼續與其戰略夥伴合作推行金融科技人才培育計劃升級版，以培育不同職業發展階段的年輕人才。去年有超過220名學生受惠於該計劃。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First, Long-Term Growth Next\"":["保本先行、長期增值"],"10 Years plus

儲備管理\n\n環球金融市場在2019年的表現好過預期，因為主要央行的寬鬆貨幣政策效果抵消了對全球經濟增長放緩和中美貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。環球股市在2018年第四季大幅調整後反彈，同時主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上升。在如此有利的環境下，外匯基金在2019年錄得投資收入262.2億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響港元匯價。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長（FS）授權，並在授權範圍內，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已為外匯基金的投資目標設定了以下。\n\n以保全資本；\n確保貨幣基礎在任何時候，均完全由高度流動的美元資產支持；\n確保有足夠的流動性可供維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n在(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以協助保全基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標已全面考慮外匯基金的法定目標，並且已納入基金的組合架構及目標資產配置。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金主要有兩個投資組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流動的美元資產，以依貨幣發行局制度規定，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場，以維護其資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興巿場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基建）以及房地產投資。新興巿場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（長期增長組合）持有。長期增長組合下投資的市值上限，定為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一總額，以及與長期增長組合相關的未來基金及外匯基金附屬公司的資金總額。\n\n策略性資產組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份由政府代表外匯基金出資購入，以達致策略性目的。由於其獨特性質，此資產組合並未納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備存款、政府資金及法定組織的存款。利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鉤，惟未來基金為主要例外，其利率與投資組合及長期增長組合掛鉤，並參考配置比例。截至2019年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合之間的配置比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和策略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表外匯基金的投資目標所決定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行配置，以嘗試達致超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置經常與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準和循跡誤差限額由財政司司長在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後決定，但策略性決策以及戰略性偏離的容許範圍則由金管局在授權下制定和設定。在容許的戰略性偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可以採取倉位以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於2018年8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室（外匯基金投資辦公室，EFIO），以統籌其投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的員工直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括全部的支持組合（BP）及部分投資組合（IP）。這部分的投資組合包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生工具疊加投資組合。\n\n# <think>\nAll six junior translations are remarkably similar, and largely correct. The core issue is the slightly awkward phrasing of \"使用外聘投資經理\" (use external managers). While grammatically sound, it lacks a certain natural flow in Chinese. The repetition of \"#\" at the beginning of some translations is also unnecessary, as it appears to be a carryover from the original markdown formatting.\nThe dictionary provides '外聘投資經理' for 'external managers', which is accurate and appropriate. The key improvement needed is to rephrase the sentence to sound more idiomatic. Instead of directly translating \"Use of external managers,\" a more natural phrasing would be \"採用外聘投資經理\" (employ external managers) or \"運用外聘投資經理\" (utilize external managers). \"採用\" implies a deliberate choice and integration, which is often the context when discussing external managers. \"運用\" suggests leveraging their expertise. Given the brevity of the original English, \"採用\" feels slightly more fitting.\nTherefore, the best translation would remove the unnecessary \"#\" and rephrase the sentence to \"採用外聘投資經理.\"<\/thing>\n採用外聘投資經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，金管局聘請外聘投資經理管理外匯基金約29%的資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。金管局聘請外聘投資經理旨在利用市場上最佳的專業投資技術，以實現可持續的回報，並發揮多樣化且互補的投資方式，從而汲取他們在市場洞察力和技術專長。\n\n與使用外聘投資經理有關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本以及預扣稅及其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素決定，每年可能有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。內部和外聘投資經理的投資組合均已制定嚴格的監控措施和投資指引，並密切監控指南和法規的遵守情況。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估已得到加強，以支持外匯基金增加的投資多元化程度。風險管控工具被應用於評估常態和不利市場狀況下的市場風險。此外，還進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別績效來源，使金管局能夠評估如何最好地利用內部和外聘投資經理的投資技能。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持外匯基金在投資過程中納入環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素，適用於公眾及私募市場投資。\n\n在公開市場投資方面，金管局實施與程序相關及投資相關的措施。金管局採納的其中一項程序相關措施是，證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《負責任的擁有權原則》（pRO），有助投資者釐清如何在投資香港上市公司時，最佳地履行其擁有權責任。在管理外匯基金時，金管局已制定涵蓋外部基金經理的委任及監察程序的ESG因素內部指引。金管局委任管理香港股票組合及中國股票主動投資管理組合的外部基金經理，須根據「符合或說明」原則，遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》；而委任管理金管局已發展市場股票組合的外部基金經理，則需遵守國際公認的ESG標準。除外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦納入金管局由內部人員負責管理的債券投資的信用風險分析中。\n\n至於公眾市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起便投資綠色債券，是這個市場的早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司運營的聯合貸款組合管理計劃，該計劃專注於新興市場的可持續項目。展望未來，金管局將透過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金來擴展其綠色債券組合。金管局亦計劃透過採用ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的新基準，並與股票投資經理合作，他們在投資決策中應用ESG因素，來建立以ESG為主題的股票投資策略。\n\n關於私募市場投資，金管局在其盡職調查過程中會審視專責合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策與實踐。特別是，在所有長期增長組合的投資中，ESG風險評估是盡職調查的必備環節。針對長期增長組合，金管局投資於具可持續性的項目；例如，自2013年起，金管局已透過直接及合作投資於可再生能源項目，以及在其房地產投資組合中投資具綠色及可持續特徵的綠色建築物及倉庫。展望未來，金管局將持續尋找具可持續性的項目，並在房地產投資中將綠色認證作為主要考量因素。\n\n金管局將密切監察環境、社會及管治（ESG）標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入其投資過程。此過程得益於金管局與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。作為聯合國支持的負責任投資原則的簽署方，而該原則為全球負責任投資的領先框架，金管局期望參與制定ESG最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採納負責任投資。此外，金管局亦是FCLTGlobal的會員，該組織是一個非營利機構，透過舉辦研討會和研究，致力於促進企業及投資決策的長遠規劃。2019年，金管局亦成為氣候相關財務資訊披露工作組的支持者。\n\n如欲了解更多關於金管局的 RI 政策架構詳情，請參閱《企業社會責任》章節。\n\n# 外匯基金表現\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管對全球經濟增長放緩和美中貿易緊張局勢有所擔憂，但由於主要央行實施了寬鬆貨幣政策，環球金融市場在2019年表現良好。在2018年第四季經歷了顯著調整後，環球股市在2019年大幅反彈。在債券市場方面，主要政府債券收益率顯著下降，而債券價格在2019年頭三個季度隨著貨幣寬鬆而上漲。儘管債券價格在第四季因收益率略有回升而回落，2019年債券市場的整體表現仍屬滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場中，主要貨幣對美元的表現各異。由於美中貿易關係升級，人民幣在第三季度下跌了3.8%，但在第四季度隨著貿易緊張局勢緩和，人民幣回升了部分前期損失。總體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。雖然由於無協議脫歐的風險升高，英鎊在第三季度下跌了3.2%，但隨著第四季度脫歐問題的逐步明朗，其後顯著反彈，最終對美元升值4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金於2019年錄得達港元2622億的投資收入。其中，債券收益為港元1145億，香港股票組合收益港元221億，其他股票收益港元1007億，非港元資產則錄得負的貨幣轉換效果港元130億，以及基金投資控股附屬公司所持其他投資的收益達港元379億。另外，策略性資產組合錄得評值收益港元25億。\n\n外匯基金的總資產在年底達到港元4,206.7億。長期增長組合的投資總值為港元335.1億，其中私募股權為港元233.4億，房地產為港元101.7億。已承擔尚未提取作投資的總額達到港元219.3億。\n\n外匯基金 2019 年的投資回報，排除策略性資產組合後為 6.6%。 具體而言，投資組合回報率達 9.7%，而支持組合則增長了 2.5%。長期增長組合自 2009 年成立以來，內部回報率年率為 12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First,

機構職能\n\n金管局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體平台、其網站、資訊中心及各種其他渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。在機構內部，致力改善金管局的公司治理，包括支持員工的專業發展、建立嚴謹的財政紀律、提升資訊科技保安，以及推動創新文化，以應對新措施實施及工作日益複雜的挑戰。\n\n# 凝聚社區\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度及推進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。本年度共舉辦125項公開活動，包括10場記者會、12場面即席訪問及103項其他公眾活動。此外，另安排了25場媒體訪問。共發佈466份新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，金管局為本地及海外傳媒以及社區內的重要意見領袖舉辦了媒體簡報會及教育研討會，以加深他們對多個範疇的了解，例如聯繫匯率制度、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為一個具競爭力的國際金融中心。\n\n自2018年7月起，金管局已推出多個社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育及溝通。目前共有五個社交媒體渠道在運作：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube，截至2019年12月底，總共擁有超過45,000名關注者。面對2019年下半年的社會事件，金管局利用社交媒體闢謠，澄清有關銀行營運及金融穩定的不實傳言，此舉在傳播事實及防止謠言擴散方面成效顯著。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供有效途徑，以更好地了解金管局的主要職能和運作。2019年共處理了9,742宗查詢，其中約一半涉及銀行業政策及規例、銀行消費者事宜以及紙幣和硬幣。顯著的查詢包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行業相關指引及通告、快速支付系統「轉數快」以及貨幣與經濟數據。\n\n圖1顯示自2016年以來收到的公共諮詢數量，圖2則提供了2019年按諮詢性質劃分的細節。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文先生在香港銀行公會卓越人士講座暨午餐會上發表演講。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文（左）與當時的金管局總裁陳德銘會見傳媒，以宣布余偉文接任金管局總裁。\n\n# 出版物\n\n除《金管局年報》外，2019年金管局亦發布了兩期《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》、四期《季報》，以及定期更新的《金融數據月報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，金管局還發布了19篇《匯思文章》，涵蓋與其工作相關的各項議題。這些《匯思文章》為金管局闡述其主要新規劃或政策背後的理由，並及時回應公眾關注的時事議題，提供了一個有用的溝通渠道。\n\n# 金管局網站\n\n金管局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過四萬頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的主要途徑。網站載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條維護的認可機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及認可機構證券業務員工登記冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》維護的儲值支付工具持牌人登記冊。今年九月，金管局官方網站進行了重大翻新，並以全新設計佈局、更豐富的內容、更完善的導覽結構及更便捷的搜尋功能重新推出。網站讓用戶能更輕鬆地根據個人喜好搜尋資訊。特別是，網站新增了「智醒消費者」專區，公眾可以在此找到關於銀行及相關產品或服務的實用資訊。這與金管局長期致力推動「聰明及負責任」使用銀行服務的目標一致。\n\n金管局推出其重新設計的網站。\n\n金管局網站更新後，新增了一個「智醒消費者」專區。\n\n金管局自2018年起分階段透過開放應用程式介面（開放API）開放其網站上發布的金融數據及重要資訊。至2019年，金管局已按原計劃在其網站上開放了130組開放API。金管局積極推動開放API的發展與應用。\n\n# 金管局資訊中心\n\n位於國際金融中心2期55樓的金管局資訊中心，是向社區介紹金管局的工作，並提升公眾對貨幣與銀行業事宜的認識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區和圖書館，並於每周開放六天。展覽區介紹了金管局的工作，以及香港的貨幣與銀行業發展情況，同時提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料和展品。\n\n金管局於本年完成了資訊中心——歷史長廊——的翻新工程。翻新的歷史長廊備有數碼顯示屏，讓訪客以更互動的方式回顧香港及全球的重大貨幣及金融事件，並於十月重新向公眾開放。\n\n歷史長廊的第一部分是多元展板，展示1842年至1993年的重大事件。\n\n歷史長廊的第二部分是一個電子展板，展示自1993年金管局成立至今的重大事件。\n\n資訊中心為遊客舉辦導覽活動。該中心當年接待了超過48,000名遊客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過480場導覽活動（圖表3）。自2003年12月開幕以來，已有超過753,000人次參觀了資訊中心。\n\n資訊中心為學校及其他團體訪客安排導覽團。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，館藏超過26,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，用以研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據《銀行業條例》第20條的規定，維護認可機構及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及認可機構證券業務員工的登記冊。\n\n# 公眾與消費者教育\n\n為接觸社區並提高公眾對金管局工作的認識，金管局於2019年舉辦了一場公開教育講座，邀請逾400名中學生及教師參與。講座內容包括介紹金管局的工作、香港紙幣、快速支付系統「轉數快」、儲值支付工具、金融科技以及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，已有超過6萬名教師及學生參與此計劃。\n\n來自不同區中學的學生和老師參加了2019年公共教育研討會。\n\n金管局本年度的消費者教育工作重點，是教育市民保護他們的「個人數碼鎖匙」。這個概念旨在幫助市民明白，保護用於登入網上帳戶的個人資料，與保護家中的鑰匙一樣重要。核心訊息是，在數碼世界中，與網上銀行和其他數碼金融服務相關的帳戶登入資料及個人資訊，都應妥善保護。為此，金管局在電視、電台、手機應用程式、社交媒體及其他數碼和戶外平台進行了廣泛宣傳，重點介紹保護個人數碼鎖匙的實用技巧。\n\n大型推廣計劃在個人數碼鎖匙方面透過廣泛的跨媒體宣傳進行。\n\n亦持續推行各項措施，以教育公眾成為聰明且負責任的金融用戶。例如，呼籲民眾提高警覺，提防冒充銀行來電的詐騙電話，以及在社交媒體上散佈的投資詐騙。處理個人信貸產品時需要注意的事項，特別是在稅務申報期間辦理的個人貸款。\n\n為提升中學生的金融知識，金管局連續第五年與各相關機構聯辦「全港通識理財問答比賽」。今年比賽首次應用資訊圖表，協助學生更深入理解複雜的金融概念。網上問答吸引逾10,450人次參與，最終舉行決賽，並首次於金管局舉行。\n\n錦標賽吸引了超過一萬份線上投稿，最終將在金管局舉行現場競賽。\n\n今年，金管局啟動了「童心親親理財學堂」的第二階段，與一所教育機構合作舉辦。這個學堂包括模擬銀行遊戲、父母講座及教師專業培訓工作坊，旨在讓幼稚園學生、家長和老師，以及年輕成人都能參與。此外，金管局還與一間專業協會合作，為小學學生和家長編製漫畫故事書，並向大專院校學生舉辦講座。\n\n金管局繼續支持投資者及理財教育委員會在香港推動金融知識，並將與不同持份者探討進一步合作，以最大化消費者教育的影響。\n\n跨世代外展計劃第一階段成果典禮與第二階段的正式啟動同時進行。\n\n幼稚園學童參與銀行模擬遊戲。\n\n漫畫故事書由專業協會聯手製作，為向小學生及其家長傳播使用銀行及金融服務的實用技巧。\n\n# 我們的夥伴\n\n雖然金管局是政府的重要組成部分，但它以與公務員不同的條件聘用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人才。金管局招募、培訓及維持一支高度專業的團隊，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作重點。\n\n二零一九年金管局的編制為一千零五人。當年，金管局進行跨部門流程再造，以提升各工作流程的效率，並重新調配現有資源以支援新舉措。由於此嚴謹的流程再造，金管局二零二零年的總體編制維持不變，仍為一千零五人。現有資源已重新調配，以執行以下新任務：\n\n# 銀行與金融穩定\n- 實施針對虛擬銀行的監管制度，並應對日益複雜的審慎監管標準\n- 提升對保險中介機構新監管制度的監督能力\n- 加強對銀行文化改革的持續監測，並對銀行及其他相關機構提供信託服務進行監管\n\n# 儲備管理\n- 加強投資及風險管理，並提供其他必要的支援，以進一步擴展及多元化外匯基金的投資活動。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心\n- 支持增強香港稅務安排在不同金融服務領域的國際競爭力。\n- 加強對交易資料儲存庫數據的日常質性市場監察及分析。\n\n表1說明了金管局的設立及規模。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據管治委員會（GSC）的建議，經外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）審議後，決定金管局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及僱傭條件，並考慮市場現行薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及公積金，實物福利極為有限。總現金薪酬包由每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及變動薪酬組成，變動薪酬可視乎個人表現，每年以一筆過形式發放予個別員工。\n\n金管局員工的薪酬每年由財政司司長檢討，並參考管治委員會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會提出的建議。檢討時會考慮管治委員會對金管局上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司對金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。有時會作出特別薪酬調整，以嘉獎表現卓越的個別員工，並維持其薪酬的競爭力。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to socialise.\n","terms":{"\"Capital preservation First,

企業社會責任\n\n金管局致力於履行其企業社會責任，並旨在成為負責任及可持續發展的機構。此承諾體現在各個方面，包括推動可持續及環境友好的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境以及營造關懷的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色永續銀行\n\n氣候變遷是威脅人類福祉和世界經濟可持續發展的主要風險之一。銀行經營的金融界是社會不可分割的一部分，同樣也會受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。金管局致力於探索應對這一挑戰的方法。在此背景下，金管局在五月公布了一系列促進香港綠色金融發展的措施，包括採納分三階段的方式推動綠色和可持續銀行業務。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n作為外匯基金的投資管理機構，金管局認為負責任投資（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於金管局是全球最大的資產所有者之一，其選擇將對基金管理人配置資產的方式產生顯著影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局認為RI是一種投資方式，會考慮環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素對長期投資回報及其可持續性的影響。金管局相信，藉由適當強調RI及長遠經濟表現，可更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並降低其基礎投資所涉及的與ESG相關的風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n金管局的指導原則是，如果長期經風險調整收益與其他投資相當，通常會優先考慮ESG投資。在適當情況下，金管局在其投資過程中採用以下負責任投資原則，這些原則體現了其作為負責任長期投資者的信念。\n\n# 整合\n\n金管局將ESG因素納入其投資分析程序，以識別風險及機會，因為金管局認為這些因素可對其投資的長期價值產生重大影響。具體而言，金管局已將ESG因素整合到公開市場投資及私募市場投資的投資過程中。針對公開市場投資，金管局在債券的信用風險分析中納入ESG因素。金管局會選聘與其RI理念相符的外聘投資經理，並向所有外聘投資經理傳達其RI理念，期望他們能協調一致，以實現整體可持續的長期經濟表現目標。針對私募市場投資，金管局會在盡職調查程序中審查專責合夥人的ESG政策及實踐。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局在其持有的上市公司股票中行使股東權利，以維護其投資的長期利益。金管局認為，以ESG因素為導向的企業責任行為有助於長遠創造股東的長期利益。金管局的資產經理預期將透過主動行使資產擁有權，包括行使投票權及與相關企業溝通，協助金管局履行其在基礎投資中的資產擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局希望與志同道合的投資者和監管機構合作，推動投資長期管理的良好實踐。金管局參與並在公開活動上發言，分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用責任投資（RI）。\n\n請參閱儲備管理一章，以了解金管局今年在RI方面的相關工作。\n\n# 推廣普及金融\n\n金管局非常重視普及金融，並一直致力於推動不同社會群體使用基本銀行服務，以滿足公眾的基本日常需求以及合法企業的營運需要。特別是，金管局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，著重以下優先領域：\n\n鼓勵銀行推出更多銀行服務設施，並發展數碼及創新渠道，以提供基本銀行服務，服務大眾，特別是偏遠地區居民、公共屋邨居民及長者；\n\n促進並監控個人及中小企開設銀行帳戶的便利性。\n\n增強銀行服務對特定客戶群體的易達性，例如，殘障人士和少數族裔。\n\n促進並監測銀行貸款向中小企業的供應；以及\n\n授權八間虛擬銀行，這些銀行將積極推動普及金融，於提供銀行服務時。\n\n# 社群\n\n# 推廣金融知識\n\n金管局透過多種渠道推廣金融知識。除了舉辦教育項目，鼓勵公眾明智且負責任地使用銀行及金融服務外，金管局在其重新設計的官方網站上設有全新專區「智醒消費者」，公眾可以在此找到關於銀行及相關產品和服務的實用資訊和貼士。除了金管局官方網站及刊物外，還利用Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram及Twitter等社交媒體平台，提供銀行及金融事務的最新資訊。\n\n金管局資訊中心自2003年起作為金管局的主要公眾教育及研究資源，向社區介紹金管局的工作，並促進公眾對貨幣與銀行業事宜的認識。 每日為來自學校及非牟利機構的團體訪客提供導覽服務。亦會為學生舉辦公眾教育講座及其他活動，以增強他們的金融知識及金融素養。此外，金管局與投資者及理財教育委員會緊密合作，透過理財教育平台「錢家有道」，在香港推廣金融知識。\n\n請參閱機構職能一章，以了解金管局在年內推動金融知識的工作。請參閱銀行體系穩定一章，以了解金管局在年內推動普及金融的工作。\n\n# 針對特殊群體的需求\n\n#

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

意見\n\n我謹此證明，我已審計外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）載於第187至293頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及其收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註，其中包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n在我意見中，該財務報表真實及公允地反映了外匯基金及集團截至2019年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至當時止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則（“香港財務報告準則”）編製，且符合《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條賦予行政長官的指示。\n\n# 意見根據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示，以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我的責任在我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節有更詳細的說明。根據這些準則，我與集團保持獨立，並已履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我發表意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我的專業判斷中，於審計2019年12月31日止年度的財務報表時，最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在審計財務報表整體過程中處理的，並在形成我的意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 金融資產和金融負債以公平值估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為港元3,874,223百萬，金融負債總額為港元1,158,686百萬，並以公平值估值。\n\n對於這些金融資產的91%以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層級輸入），或透過基於可觀察市場數據的估值方法進行估算（第二層級輸入）。\n\n對於這些金融資產中剩餘的9%，其公允價值是透過估值方法估算，而這些方法所使用的輸入值並非基於可觀察市場數據（第三層輸入值）。此類金融資產總額為港元338.758億元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於涉及的金額龐大且涉及估計，金融資產及金融負債的公平值評估為關鍵審計事項。\n\n金融資產及金融負債公平值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n了解評估不同類別金融資產和金融負債的程序，涵蓋相關監控措施。\n\n評估及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的應用程式監控措施。\n\n取得金融資產及金融負債之評價、存在性、權利義務及完整性之函證。\n\n若引用市場價格，則需核實價格對獨立來源。\n\n- 在採用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法時，評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並核實輸入數據來源是否為獨立來源；以及\n\n在使用非可觀察市場數據的估值方法時，評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入值的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業的公平值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公允價值計入，截至2019年12月31日總計為港元22,481億元。集團亦持有二十二間合營公司，總計港元44,506億元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由集團直接持有或由合營公司持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。有關估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括估值方法及假設。\n\n審計程序包括投資物業以公平值估值：\n\n取得及審閱集團直接或透過合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值是否根據估值報告所載的估值。\n\n審查估價師的獨立性和資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適當性以及假設及輸入資料的合理依據。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金融管理專員負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括金融管理專員2019年年報內的所有資訊，除財務報表及我的審計師報告外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此提供任何形式的保證。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估其是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否存在重大錯誤陳述。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為此資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我將報告此事實。目前，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會就財務報表的職責\n\n金融管理專員負責根據香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，編製真實且公允的財務報表。同時，金融管理專員亦負責建立其認為有必要以確保財務報表沒有重大錯誤陳述的內部控制，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員負責評估集團的持續經營能力，披露與持續經營相關的事項（如適用），並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會負責監察集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是就財務報表整體是否存有重大錯誤陳述，取得合理確信，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，並發布一份審計師報告，其中包含我的意見。合理確信是一種高度的確信，但並非保證，依照審計署的審計準則所執行的審計，通常能夠發現存在的重大錯誤陳述。錯誤可能源於欺詐或錯誤，並且如果個別或總體上，它們可能合理地預期會影響基於這些財務報表所做的使用者經濟決策，則被視為重大錯誤陳述。\n\n作為根據審計署的審計準則進行審計的一部分，我運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我：\n\n識別並評估財務報表是否存在因舞弊或錯誤導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，作為我提出意見的基礎。未能發現因舞弊導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤導致的風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制。\n\n取得與審計相關的內部控制之了解，以設計適當的審計程序，但並非用以就集團的內部控制有效性發表意見；\n\n評估金融管理專員所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其所作的會計估計和相關披露的合理性。\n\n就評估金融管理專員採用持續經營基礎進行會計的適當性，並根據所取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我將在我的審計師報告中引起注意財務報表中相關的披露內容，如果這些披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至我的審計師報告日期所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來的事件或情況可能會導致集團無法持續經營。\n\n評估財務報表整體的呈現、結構及內容，包括披露事項，並確認財務報表是否以公允呈列的方式反映交易及事項；並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我負責集團審計的指導、監督及執行。我對我的審計意見負全責。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會就審計的計劃範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺失等事宜進行溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向他們通報所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，如適用時，提供相關保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會溝通的事項，我確定那些在本期財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，因此為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面影響合理預期會高於公開溝通所帶來的公共利益，否則我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n朱約翰\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n26樓\n入境大廈\n7
