{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石。\n\n自1983年實施的聯繫匯率制度（LERS）幫助香港抵禦了多次挑戰和衝擊，展現了其作為香港經濟繁榮基石及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管當年面對困難的內外環境，聯繫匯率制度仍繼續以暢順有序的方式運作，再一次證明其在不確定性時期的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦仍然穩健強大。港元匯率在近月保持穩定，並加強至兌換範圍的強大範圍內，而銀行存款在當年持續增長。簡單而言，未觀察到香港元或銀行體系出現明顯資金外流。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行體系的穩定反映了我們體系的穩健，亦體現了對我們體系的強大信心。這並非一夜之間發生，而是經過多年的努力，建立緩衝並加強監察，輔以我們對社交媒體平台上的謠言作出迅速回應。\n\n多年來我們為應對雨天的準備，已為香港的貨幣和銀行體系建立了穩固的根基和強大的緩衝。此外，我們的資金中擁有龐大的外匯儲備，銀行體系亦具強大的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性以及良好資產質素，無論是按國際標準或歷史標準皆是如此。自2009年起落實的8輪針對按揭的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，大大加強了銀行對物業市場逆轉的抵禦能力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監管構成我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們亦不時加強監察及監管架構。除了緊密監察銀行的信貸及流動性風險外，今年我們的一項新舉措是利用科技及從銀行收集的細緻數據，提升我們監察港元資金及金融市場活動的能力，以適時深入的方式進行。同時，因應快速變化的經濟及營運環境，壓力測試及應變計劃亦已加強。\n\n事實上，我們健全的監管制度已獲得國際社會的廣泛認可。今年，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定香港具備良好條件，應對周期性及結構性變化，鑒於其重大緩衝能力。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資方面的有效法律及制度架構亦取得金融行動特別任務組（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太區首個在FATF互評中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的根基，對保障貨幣和金融穩定至關重要。為維持市場信心，我們必須保持警覺，迅速回應任何可能引發對香港貨幣或銀行體系的懷疑的惡意謠言。鑒於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及，這特別重要。在社會事件期間，恐慌製造者曾在社交媒體平台上散播各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速且明確地澄清這些謠言，證明這對釋除疑慮、制止不實謠言傳播，以及維持國際及公眾對我們體系的信心，是有用且有效的。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱。\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，發揮著確保社會和經濟暢順運作的基本作用。儘管自下半年以來營運環境困難，銀行業仍與其他機構一同努力，竭盡全力維持其核心功能的正常運作，並繼續服務企業和公眾。\n\n此外，除了存款和轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的一個重要功能是提供信貸給借款人，以支持實體經濟。我們明白並關切企業，尤其是在困難經濟狀況下所面對的資金周轉問題。在保障銀行穩定的前提下，我們已推出一系列措施，以確保繼續向中小企提供資金支持。特別是，銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率在10月2019年和3月2020年兩次下調，總計150個基點至1.0%；銀行存款準備金率亦在4月2020年下調一半。這些措施釋放約一萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多向企業（包括中小企）提供貸款的空間。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行界中小企貸款協調機制——匯聚香港主要銀行，共同探索和討論具體措施，以加強對中小企的資金支持。我樂見不少銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，並引入了例如針對有需要的客戶提供還息不還本等紓緩措施，以克服當前難關。\n\n鑒於一些中小企反映開立銀行帳戶的困難，而這正是使用各項銀行服務的首個步驟，我們過去幾年來一直致力應對這個問題。我們的工作已取得成效，企業開戶的改善情況已可見。為進一步推動金融包容，香港金管局主導推出分層帳戶服務－簡易帳戶（SBAs），採用精簡的客戶盡職審查程序，為初創企業和中小企提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。截至目前為止，已開立超過2,800個SBAs。\n\n# 國際金融中心：日益彰顯實力\n\n我們一直留意到監管與發展之間需要取得合理平衡。鑒於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其更長期的穩定。目前有四個重點範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融互聯互通，以及人才發展。\n\n# 迎向數位時代的科技\n\n香港自2016年設立香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室，並於2017年引入智能銀行計劃後，便快速推動金融科技發展。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活力可見於轉數快（FPS）的採用勢頭，它是全球首個支持多幣種、跨行及電子錢包的實時零售支付平台。轉數快登記數目在短短15個月內達到四百萬，相當於在750萬市民人口中具有高滲透率。政府亦採用轉數快，為市民提供繳交稅款、地稅及水費時的更大方便。預期越來越多企業將使用這種快速、安全及方便的收取及付款方式，以提升運營效率。\n\n在銀行業，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務營運方面，看到重大進展。根據香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行的一項研究，接近九成受訪的零售銀行已採用，或正計劃採用人工（智能）於其業務應用中。在HKMA的協助下，銀行已應用大數據及消費者行為（分析）於其個人信貸產品。他們亦已在首兩個階段推出超過800個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋一系列銀行產品及服務。在鼓勵銀行使用金融科技的同時，我們亦沒有忽略加強數字銀行服務中科技風險管理及消費者保護的需要。適時的監管指引已提供給銀行於這些範疇。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行界另一重要領域，因其潛在能力支持銀行更有效率且有效益地進行監管合規和風險管理，特別是在反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界更廣泛採用Regtech並建立更廣泛的Regtech生態系統，香港金管局於11月舉辦了首屆AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發佈了首個Regtech通訊，以討論Regtech的潛在應用情況。同時，作為銀行監管機構，香港金管局正探討應用監管科技（Suptech），包括新數據科學與分析技術，以提升工作成效與效率。我們已開展一系列研究，並制定了藍圖，用於之後幾年落實Suptech。\n\n從更廣的角度來看，這僅僅是銀行業金融科技旅程的開始。金管局本年批出8張虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行於2020年3月正式推出其服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行已透過金管局的金融科技監管沙盒開始試點計劃。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及為香港市民引入更多創新和多元的銀行服務，幫助提高我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n更多精彩發展亦預期會在國際層面出現。在成功完成一項試驗，將我們的區塊鏈貿易融資平台 eTradeConnect 與其歐洲對接夥伴連接後，我們正在進行另一項試驗，與中國人民銀行的平台合作，以促進跨境貿易的數碼化。我們已開始與泰國銀行展開一項聯合研究項目，探討中央銀行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行亦於11月在香港投入首個創新樞紐中心運作，以促進中央銀行界別內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地證明了香港在金融科技發展領域的領先作用。\n\n# 推動綠色及可持續金融，為了更美好的未來。\n\n氣候相關風險近年來備受全球關注。為貢獻全球應對此挑戰的努力，香港金管局於5月公布三項關鍵措施，以推動香港在不同領域的綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正採取一個分三個階段的方式，推動綠色及可持續銀行業務。在第一階段，已制定一套評估銀行「綠色基準」的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定監管期望及要求，以及第三階段的落實奠定基礎。\n\n作為匯券基金的經理，香港金融管理局積極推進責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入其投資活動中。具體而言，我們已採用在風險調整後的基礎上，若綠色及ESG投資的長線回報與其他投資相若，則優先（考慮）綠色及ESG投資的原則。早於2015年投資者中，我們投資於綠色債券市場，並將繼續增長綠色債券組合，並投資於其他環境、社會及管治資產。我們亦將與理念相近的投資者及監管機構攜手，透過參與ESG社群的國際組織，推動ESG的最佳實踐。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of

經濟與金融環境\n\n在2019年全球經濟放緩、中美貿易摩擦持續以及本地社會事件的影響下，香港經濟出現回軟，同時勞動市場面臨增加的壓力。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健且有韌性，擁有強大資本、充足的流動性及健康的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管面對困難的內外環境，香港的貨幣制度穩固且穩健，這體現在港元匯率的穩定以及外匯及貨幣市場的暢順運作。這不僅反映了香港貨幣制度的穩健，亦展現了對其穩固的信心。\n\n一項新解決方案機制被引入，並作出若干優化措施，於香港金管局修訂的流動性便利設施框架內。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n金管局投放巨大努力監控銀行信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行穩定。亦作出良好進展，推動智能銀行發展，包括授予8間虛擬銀行牌照，並鼓勵採用監管科技。這些努力輔以監督銀行科技風險管理，以及加強數字金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n香港金融管理局理順投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時採取進一步舉措，推動以客戶為中心的銀行文化。\n\n香港的反洗錢及反恐融資制度獲得金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的正面評估，使其成為亞太區首個在FATF第四輪互認評估中取得整體合規結果的成員管轄區。\n\n新規則及條例已推出，以符合最新國際標準，提升銀行監管制度。香港公布三個階段的方案，推動綠色及可持續銀行業，成為全球應對氣候變化的努力。\n\n同時，香港金融管理局作出重大進展，特別是推動落實銀行解決機制，並建立一層新的損失吸收能力，以推動本地系統重要銀行金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港的金融科技生態系統正增強勢頭，在銀行業落實開放應用程式介面框架方面取得良好進展，設立了全球首個國際結算銀行創新中心，並繼續增加使用更快支付系統進行電子支付。\n\n香港保持堅定的立足點，作為離岸人民幣業務的全球中心。在粵港澳大灣區發展的背景下，香港與內地的金融聯繫正在加強，香港居民使用金融服務也更加方便。\n\n大量努力作出以開放新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，特別在基礎設施投資和融資、綠色金融及私人股權基金方面。\n\n香港金融學院設立，旨在成為培育金融領導力的卓越中心，並作為貨幣與金融研究知識的寶庫，包括應用研究。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受惠於利好投資環境，香港儲備基金錄得歷來第二高的投資收入，達2,622億港元，相當於6.6%。\n\n香港金融管理局深化其在投資多元化方面的努力，尤其著重於長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。自2009年成立以來，LTGP錄得年化內部回報率12.6%。在推動責任投資方面亦有鼓勵的進展。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及各項其他渠道，保持與社會和市場的有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及營運的了解。\n\n在機構內，香港金融管理局非常重視維持企業管治，透過支持員工專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律及提升資訊科技保安，以應對因落實新措施及工作複雜度增加而帶來的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents.

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易衝突及本地社會事件。隨著經濟情況在下半年迅速惡化，勞動市場面對增加的壓力。通脹亦因豬肉價格急升而增加。鑒於新型冠狀病毒爆發對本已轉弱的經濟雪上加霜，預計2020年的經濟表現將持續困難。鑒於困難的經濟環境，政府及香港金融管理局已推出措施支持經濟，尤其家庭及中小企業。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 真實活動\n\n隨着2018年出現2.9%的增長，香港經濟在2019年收縮了1.2%，標誌着自2009年以來首個年度收縮。特別是，經濟在下半年進入衰退，季節性調整後的實際國內生產總值（GDP）在第二、第三及第四季度連續下跌（表1）。經濟活動的下跌反映了國內需求顯著減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件對消費活動和情緒產生大幅影響，私人消費開支記錄了自2003年以來首個年度下跌。整體投資開支亦在低迷的商業情緒下有所下降。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩以及在美中貿易摩擦之下實施的額外關稅，帶來了香港商品出口的下跌。服務出口亦出現紀錄上最大年度下跌，因為社會事件帶來了入境旅遊的嚴重轉差。由於國內和再出口誘發的需求較小，商品和服務進口也轉差。從淨貿易角度來看，淨貿易在2019年帶來支持GDP（圖1），因為總進口下跌的速度比總出口更快。\n\n鑑於強大的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間推出多項措施，以減輕居民的財務負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企以及受重創的行業，包括零售、食品服務、運輸及旅遊業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟並緩和經濟週期，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率由2.5%降至2.0%，從而讓銀行擁有更多靈活性，釋放港幣200至300億元的銀行信貸，提供予包括中小企在內的企業，亦設立了中小企貸款協調機制。此外，於9月推出了一項新的中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）80%擔保產品的減輕措施，讓資金流轉弱的中小企借款人可申請還息不還本，以獲得即時支持。進一步地，於12月推出了SFGS下的新九成貸款擔保產品，為中小企、經營經驗較少的企業，以及希望設立自己業務的專業人士提供額外支持，以取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年，香港的率及貨幣市場以暢順有序的方式運作。港元匯率在全年大致穩定。由於3月疲弱側可兌換承擔被觸發，金管局以7.85港元兌1美元的匯率向銀行購入港元，並向銀行出售美元，導致根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，總結餘下跌。港元銀行間利率在更長期維持大致穩定，而短期利率則普遍上揚。在零售層面，多項零售銀行在接近年底的10月，隨着美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的下調，調低其最佳貸款利率12.5個基點。至於貨幣總量，總銀行貸款在2019年增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%上升，而總存款則在當年增長2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n基礎通脹率，扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，於2019年輕微上升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%。通脹的輕微上升主要促使於自5月起豬肉供應中斷，導致豬肉價格上漲（圖2）。排除基本食品項目後，全年價格壓力大致維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費者物價通脹中的住宅租金成分，與較早前私人住宅新鮮出租租金的整合同步放緩。更廣泛地說，名義工資的輕微增長以及商業租金的放緩，有助於控制本地商業成本。從外部來看，進口價格通脹放緩，符合香港部分重大進口來源的通脹下跌，在較慢的全球經濟增長情況下。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場大致保持有韌性，但下半年則面臨日益增加的壓力（圖3）。經過首兩個季度維持在多年低點2.8%後，季節性調整後的失業率在第三季度上升至2.9%，第四季度則上升至3.3%，其中消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率在社會事件之下更見可見上升。整體勞動需求在下半年亦明顯收縮，總就業人數和私人部門職位空缺數目均下降。勞動需求的減少特別明顯於零售、住宿及食品服務行業，以及進出口貿易和建築行業。在供給範圍內，勞動力參與率輕微下降，部分原因是對經濟衰退的周期性回應。隨著勞動市場壓力不斷增加，名義工資和收入的增長在年底顯示出放緩的跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了劇烈波動。首個四個月市場攀升後，由於對中美貿易摩擦升溫的擔憂（圖4），恒生指數在5月急跌。雖然在6月回應主要中央銀行顯示更寬鬆貨幣政策的信號後，股價有所回升，但隨着全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件，股價再次承受壓力。年底，美國與中國大陸達成「第一階段」貿易協議後，股價重新爭取到一些上升勢頭。恒生指數以28,190點收市，全年整體錄得9.1%的年度上升。相反，平均每日成交額較去年同期下跌約19%。一家重大內地科技公司和一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，幫助通過首次公開招股（首次公開招股）籌集的股本資金擴展至3,142億港元。香港在2019年連續第二年在全球首次公開招股籌資額方面高踞首位。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2019年首五個月錄得強勁反彈，但其後全年整體有所回落。年初市場氣氛因對中美貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時緩和而提升，部分原因是此，但隨後因中美貿易摩擦再升級、持續的社會事件以及本地經濟狀況轉差，氣氛再度受挫。整體樓價自5月至12月回落5%，但由於早於首五個月錄得10%的反彈（圖4），全年仍錄得5%的增長。2019年的交易量較較早前增加4%，達到59,797宗，反映了早於年初強勁的交易活動。房屋可負擔性仍然偏緊，樓價收入比及收入負擔比分別高達17.9及80.9，遠高於其長線平均。為協助有即時房屋需要 的買家，香港按揭證券公司（HKMC）於10月調高了符合按揭保險計劃資格的已落成住宅物業的上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面對更強的壓力。特別是，零售物業的價格及租金自2008年全球金融危機以來錄得最大下調，反映了當年營商環境轉差。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港的經濟表現預計在2020年將面臨重大挑戰，與新型冠狀病毒爆發相關的短期下行風險顯著。一些行業，例如零售、住宿、食品服務、旅遊及交通，尚未從社會事件所造成的影響中完全復原，將會受到雙重打擊。然而，2020\/21財政預算中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金發放以及在SFGS下提供的新低息貸款，並承諾100%政府擔保，預期將對經濟提供一定支持，尤其惠及家庭及中小企。2020年3月16日，香港金融管理局進一步下調銀行逆周期資本緩衝比率，由2.0%降至1.0%，這將讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，特別是那些預期會因新型冠狀病毒爆發所帶來額外短期壓力的行業及個人。按GDP組成部分分析，私人消費及投資可能維持疲弱，原因在於消費者及企業信心脆弱。雖然政府消費將貢獻經濟增長，但公共投資支出預期在一些重大項目完成後將相對放緩。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議被評估對本地經濟在短期內有輕微正面影響。然而，香港的對外貿易表現仍將受到全球經濟增長和貿易流量疲弱的影響。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區域供應鏈中斷及跨境經濟活動放緩，例如在旅遊業，從而抑制香港的出口。政府預測2020年實際GDP增長將涵蓋-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織及私人分析機構的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n通貨膨脹壓力預期在2020年會因經濟狀況欠佳、私人住宅租賃市場的整合以及輕微的進口通膨而趨於溫和。市場共識預測2020年的總體通膨率為1.8%，而政府則預計總體和基礎通膨率將分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動力市場方面，鑒於經濟前景疲弱及冠狀病毒疫情爆發，失業率在短期內可能進一步上升。私營部門分析師預計2020年的失業率將上升至約4%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年經濟前景審慎，受到多項不確定性及風險的影響，包括來自全球經濟放緩、美中貿易關係、中國大陸的經濟表現、本地社會事件以及新型冠狀病毒爆發持續的影響。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發若持續延長，可能導致更可見的全球經濟放緩，並引發資產重新定價，導致不利的宏觀經濟環境與更緊縮的金融條件，進一步對國內實體經濟造成下行壓力。然而，主要央行協調的貨幣政策寬鬆努力，可能提供緩衝，以抵消疫情對經濟造成的負面影響。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n儘管2019年面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易摩擦及本地社會事件等困難環境，香港銀行業仍表現出韌性。銀行資產負債表趨勢保持穩定，貸款和存款均適度增長。銀行業的資本和流動性狀況穩固，資產質量亦保持良好。銀行業在資產回報率穩定的情況下，錄得盈利。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣穩定\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。港元匯率全年保持穩定，並在年底接近兌換範圍的強勢一方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次展現其對衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港幣對美元在外匯市場的匯率在一個區間內保持穩定，該區間為每美元7.75–7.85港元。貨幣制度的結構特點是貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少100%由美元儲備支持，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n\n債務憑證，提供十足支持予三間發行紙幣的銀行。\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中的總餘額，即銀行持有於香港金融管理局（HKMA）的清算賬戶餘額的合共。\n\n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及票息憑證（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制，以及金管局堅定 履行 兌換範圍 的承諾（CUs）來保持的。當 港元 需求 大於 供應，且 市場 匯率 轉強 至 強大 兌換範圍 的 7.75 港元兌一 美元 時，金管局 準備好 在 要求 之下 向銀行 出售 港元 以 換取 美元。其後，結餘 將 會 擴展，推動 港元 利率 下降，從而 創造 貨幣 狀況，使 港元 回復 至 7.75 至 7.85 的 兌換範圍 內。反之，如果 港元 供應 大於 需求，且 市場 匯率 疲弱 至 弱勢 兌換範圍 的 7.85 港元兌一 美元 時，金管局 準備好 在 要求 之下 從 銀行 買入 港元。其後，結餘 將 會 收縮，推動 港元 利率 上升，使 港元 保持 在 兌換範圍 內。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，以及本地經濟放緩，港元在2019年仍然穩定，並以暢順有序的方式進行交易。年初時，港元與美元的負息差擴大，吸引投資者進行沽出港元、買入美元的套息交易，推動港元匯率接近弱方兌換範圍7.85（圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續轉弱，弱方兌換範圍最終在3月觸發8次。其後，港元持續維持在弱方兌換範圍7.85附近。自5月起，由於大型新股集資活動帶來了強勁的港元需求，企業股息支付需求以及半年結算，導致港元匯率加強。雖然半年結算後港元匯率一度下跌，但自10月起重拾勢頭，並在年底時保持在兌換範圍的強方範圍內。這部分反映了與股權相關的需求，包括新股集資，以及部分因接近年底流動性收緊而導致的沽空港元頭寸平倉。整體而言，港元匯率市場在2019年全年正常運作。\n\n由於弱方結算價被觸發，總結算餘額（貼現窗前）及未償還的發行債券由2018年底的11,362億港元下跌至2019年底的11,330億港元（圖2）。當年，金管局根據銀行要求，在弱方結算價為7.85的情況下，購入總額221億港元，導致總結算餘額（貼現窗前）由2018年底的764億港元收縮至2019年底的543億港元。當年未償還的發行債券由1,059.8億港元輕微增加至10,787億港元，反映根據既定做法發行發行債券以吸收發行債券的利息支付。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足由外匯儲備支持。總結算餘額（貼現窗前）及未償還的外匯基金債券和票據於2019年底為11,330億港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2019年，香港美元銀行同業利率在更長期端仍然大致穩定，而短期利率則大致上升（圖3）。短期利率亦經歷更多波動，主要受新股集資相關資金需求及季節性流動性需要所帶動。自2018年4月以來，總結餘額的減少，可能帶來香港美元銀行同業利率對本地市場港元資金供求變動的更高敏感度。\n\n基準利率於2018年8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共下調75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至2019年11月初的2.00%。美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次調整，總計下調75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。在11月18至26日及12月19至31日，基準利率調整至高於2.00%，反映了該年最後兩個月，一夜之間及每月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）顯著上揚的趨勢。因此，基準利率於2019年底收報2.49%。基準利率的調整根據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式進行，該公式訂定基準利率為高於美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限50個基點，或一夜之間及每月HIBORs的五日移動平均數的平均值，取較高者。在零售方面，多項零售銀行在10月接近年底美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下降後，調低了最佳貸款利率12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期點數的折扣在首兩個月擴闊，大致跟隨港元對美元的息差變化，12個月期港元遠期點數在2月中達到約-708點（圖4）。其後，隨著負的港元對美元息差收窄，港元遠期點數的折扣逐漸縮窄，並在年底轉為保費。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場運作有序。貼現窗借款在2019年減少至383億港元，較2018年的402億港元有所減少。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出大幅貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其韌性。在今年社會事件的背景下，一啲無根據的謠言在社交媒體上流通，對聯繫匯率制度和香港的金融穩定產生懷疑。金管局果斷且積極地駁斥這些謠言，並透過傳統媒體和社交媒體釋除公眾疑慮，重申聯繫匯率制度將維持，香港不會實行外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局發布了數目文章，幫助公眾了解聯繫匯率制度的運作、資金流向以及利率前景。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯繫匯率制度的信心，正如全年市場的有序運作所反映。政府亦穩固地支持聯繫匯率制度。公眾對政府承諾以及使用港元作為支付方式和保值方式的信心，因外匯和貨幣市場的穩定而得到進一步鞏固。在2019年與香港的第四條協議磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定其一向支持聯繫匯率制度，將其視為香港金融穩定的基石，並評論聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港適當的匯率安排，其支持來自香港透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對 LERS 的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系高度流動性且穩健，流動性狀況和資本充裕程度均遠高於最低國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局一直緊密監察銀行信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試的結果，並保持其對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管努力。與上一年的總結餘相比，銀行普遍加強了流動性管理安排，並在日常資金狀況方面更加積極。此外，金管局一直與銀行保持緊密對話，以確保市場上流動性的良好回收，尤其是在大型首次公開招股的認購期之前和期間。今年並未見到任何結算堵塞的情況，貼現窗口繼續有效且有效率地運作。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將一特定部分的外匯基金資產分配以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2019年於109.9–112.1%範圍內波動，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。比率在12月31日收報111.2%（圖5）。根據LERS，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用作支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元匯率。面對突發衝擊，外匯基金的大量財政資源與香港穩健的銀行體系將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（CBC）的貨幣發行委員會小組監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2019年，CBC 考慮了包括對LERS營運的事件研究、香港整體結餘與利率之間的關係、有關LERS的選擇權市場觀點的提升及更靈活的處理方式，以及未來首次公開招股對HIBOR的影響等議題。CBC就這些議題進行的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣板營運報告，均已刊登於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n#

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new

由於行業的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件期間繼續正常運作。為確保對公眾造成的不便盡可能減至最低，已採取相關措施。在該年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）專注於對授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理。 鑒於網絡威脅不斷升級，以及行業對科技的增長依賴性，香港金融管理局加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局精簡其投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。我們亦加強了在數位金融服務中的消費者保護，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組對香港AML\/CFT制度進行第4季互認評估的結果。整體而言，香港的制度被評估為合規且有效，特別是銀行界對風險的良好了解，以及香港金融管理局以風險為基礎的監管工作在AML\/CFT方面獲得正面認可。香港金融管理局繼續參與公私合作，分享有關詐騙及洗錢的情報，並積極支持銀行界採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，金管局於2019年批出（牌照）8間虛擬銀行的銀行牌照，並公布了一個三個階段的策略，以推動香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。金管局一直與銀行業界保持緊密合作，以優化監管政策和流程，並開展人才培育計劃，促進人才的發展。\n\n同時，本地實施國際監管標準取得顯著進展，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準和大額風險敞口標準。香港金融管理局亦繼續其工作，以確保將為持牌機構作出可信的處置機制，包括實施有關吸收損失能力要求的規則，以提升持牌機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。在於金融體系具有高度韌性，並且能夠提供香港經濟需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其企業的經營方式，可能影響系統的穩定性，在極端情況下，甚至可能因失序而失敗。金融管理局作為監察當局，發揮關鍵作用，透過確保銀行有韌性以應對衝擊，並能在危機發生時回應以恢復其地位，從而最終有助於預防危機。金融管理局負責在香港對銀行進行審慎監察。其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和存款公司，這些公司統稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。金融管理局亦負責指定和監察若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保，亦非香港審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為處置當局，致力確保在認可機構變得不可持續時，其失敗可以有序地處理。為此，香港已設立一套處置機制，根據該機制，貨幣管理局為認可機構的處置當局。為確保香港的處置機制有效運作，制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置計劃以移除對認可機構處置可行性的阻礙，並提升 HKMA 解決失敗認可機構的能力至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，HKMA 采用國際協調方式。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2019年，進行了196項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評分評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續推動更強風險治理的努力的一部分，與持牌機構的董事會或董事會級別委員會舉行了26場會議。此外，香港金融管理局、持牌機構及其外部審計師之間召開了32場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦有進行定期現場審查，並針對評估風險較高的範疇補充主題審查。本年度共進行了405項現場審查和主題審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些審查和審閱的重點。另一重大重點是科技風險和營運風險管理。金管局同時增加針對流動性風險和市場風險管理以及落實巴塞爾資本充足度框架的現場審查和主題審查的數目。同時，專業團隊對持牌機構（Authorized Institutions）在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關企業的活動進行現場審查和主題審查。\n\n表 1 載有香港金融管理局於2019年監管活動的整體概要。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n2019年銀行貸款適度增加。總貸款額增長6.7%，相比2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款及用於香港以外的貸款分別增長7.7%及5.8%。\n\n截至2019年底，內地相關貸款增至金管局4,564億，按年增長7.4%（表3）。\n\n人工智能的資產品質仍然健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率輕微下降，從2018年底的0.51%降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。整體銀行業的不良貸款比率輕微增加，從0.55%增至0.57%。具體而言，在與大陸相關的貸款方面，零售銀行不良貸款比率從2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，仍低於歷史標準。整體銀行業的比率則從一年前的0.55%上升至0.75%。\n\n在該年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）增加監管力度，以確保銀行機構（AIs）在不確定的經濟環境下繼續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。償付能力壓力測試已加強，以納入更全面的風險範疇和更嚴重的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極為的衝擊。為評估銀行機構在不同範疇的信貸風險管理實務，進行了針對性的和主題性的審查，例如向從事高風險業務的企業提供融資、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的擔保融資。鑒於中小企（SMEs）在經濟下滑期間可能面對更大的挑戰，香港金融管理局於10月設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，期望鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內繼續支持中小企的融資需要。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n香港銀行業對房地產市場逆轉的韌性，自2009年起，因香港金融管理局引入的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎政策而大幅加強。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）在2019年12月降至53%，自2009年9月的64%（在逆周期措施首次引入前）。新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）亦在2019年12月降至36%，自2010年8月的41%（當供款與入息比率上限首次應用時）（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監督\n\n香港金融管理局採用三個階段的方案，以實施網絡韌性評估框架，根據網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）。第一階段評估，涵蓋所有重大銀行，已在2018年落成。餘下階段的評估，涵蓋第二及第三階段，已實質性完成，大致按照計劃進行。鑒於過去幾年的經驗，金管局亦開展了對CFI的全面檢討，以完善該計劃。\n\n10月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）刊登了《監管政策手冊》（SPM）關於「電子銀行風險管理」的修訂模組。此修訂旨在提供業界更大的靈活性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。香港金融管理局亦刊登了一套智能（人工智能）的高層原則，以提供指引給業界。\n\n自6月社會事件開始以來，香港金融管理局一直與業界保持緊密對話，以監察對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）的現金，並盡快維修被破壞的設施。香港金融管理局亦迅速採取行動，反駁惡意謠言，以維護公眾對銀行體系的信心。 鑒於銀行業的共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施已盡快恢復正常服務，並將對公眾造成的不便減至最低。鑒於社會事件帶來上升的營運風險，銀行被要求採取額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理之監督\n\n本年度，進行了一輪主題審查，以評估金融機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點為金融機構流動性壓力測試計劃及應急融資管理的穩健性。香港金融管理局亦評估金融機構在計算流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）方面是否符合監管要求，以確保計算所用輸入數據的謹慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業日益普及，香港金融管理局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估人工智能在這領域的風險管理實踐。考慮到倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止刊登，香港金融管理局提醒人工智能機構做好轉向替代參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查以監察它們的準備情況。\n\n# 反洗錢及反恐融資（ML\/TF）\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）對授權機構（AIs）的反洗錢／反恐融資（AML\/CFT）系統進行以風險為本的監管。本年度內，進行了18次現場檢查及61次非現場檢討，包括針對私人銀行及新技術應用治理的主題性檢討。香港金融管理局從針對授權機構在中小企（SMEs）應用以風險為本的AML\/CFT控制措施的主題性檢討中分享觀察結果及最佳實踐，以協助授權機構採用適當的中小企開戶程序及服務提供方式。\n\n# 金融行動特別工作組（FATF）互認評估（ME）香港報告\n\n2019年，香港金融管理局及香港整體反洗錢\/反恐融資（AML\/CFT）制度的亮點，是金融行動特別小組（FATF）於9月發表了ME報告。該報告代表了FATF第四輪對其成員司法管轄區的評估中，最佳的整體成果之一。香港在評估其AML\/CFT制度的成效時，於11項即時成果中獲得六項「重大成效」評級，並在ME的技術合規方面獲得高分。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局以風險為本的反洗錢\/反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管方法給予評估，指出香港金融管理局對銀行業的洗錢\/恐怖融資（ML\/TF）風險有良好了解，對儲值支付工具（SVF）業的風險亦有合理了解。報告亦對銀行業的共同AML\/CFT努力表示支持，例如較大的人工智能（AI）機構增加使用數據分析，大部分可疑交易報告均由AI機構提交，以及業界積極參與訛騙及洗錢工作組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議多項改善範疇，包括對一些高風險範疇的了解，例如外國貪污和稅務罪行，以及培育如SVF等領域。有關工作已經開始應對這些建議；香港金融管理局於七月刊登了修訂後的SVF行業洗錢及恐怖融資風險評估，並已開始針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理進行主題式實地檢查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last

國際金融中心\n\n香港是一個世界各地具有競爭力的國際金融中心。落實智慧銀行措施已取得良好進展，以進一步推動香港作為金融科技樞紐。藉著利用內地金融市場開放所帶來嘅機遇，已作出大量進展以推動粵港澳大灣區的金融合作，尤其是在便利香港居民於該領域跨境使用金融和銀行服務方面。\n\n同時，作出大量努力，以開放新機遇，進一步加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基礎設施投資及融資、綠色金融及私募股權基金。香港金融學院已設立，以可持續的方式提升香港的軟實力。\n\n在香港的貨幣當局及監管界別中，香港金融管理局發揮領導作用，參與多個區域及國際委員會，這明確地肯定了香港在國際工作方面的專業知識和承諾。\n\n# 概述\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位，香港金融管理局投放巨大努力實施2017年9月公布的七項智慧銀行倡議，旨在促進金融科技在銀行及支付產業的發展與應用。這些倡議在本年度的進展包括：\n\n擴大轉數快 (FpS) 的應用；\n促進開放應用程式介面 (API) 框架第一及第二階段 (II) 在銀行業的落實；\n進一步提升金融科技研究和人才發展；\n加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；授予8間虛擬銀行牌照；\n促進業界日益使用金融科技監管沙盒 (FSS) 2.0 推出金融科技計劃；以及\n透過「銀行服務容易」計劃，進一步促進監管科技 (Regtech) 的採用。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局銀行部門一同，發揮關鍵作用，推動落實這些倡議。\n\n香港發揮著促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產的重要作用，憑藉其透過滬港通及債券通等方案，享有無與倫比的參與內地市場機會。 過去一年，債券通註冊投資者數目及每日成交額增長兩倍，可見其顯著成效。為提供更多便利與靈活性，滬港通及債券通亦進一步引入改進措施，讓國際投資者更易於投資內地證券。香港金融管理局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探索並實施一系列金融便利措施，以促進香港居民能更便捷地跨境使用粵港澳大灣區（GBA）的金融及銀行服務，包括一個預期中的雙向理財通方案。香港持續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的關鍵地位。根據國際清算銀行（BIS）三年一度的外匯（FX）及衍生工具市場成交額調查，香港繼續是全球最大離岸人民幣外匯中心。\n\n持續投入努力，開拓新機遇，以進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為推動香港基金業務的發展，香港金融管理局與政府及業界緊密合作，提供更利好的稅務及監管環境，以促進基金設立。為推動香港成為綠色金融、基礎設施投資與融資及企業財務中心（CTCs）的樞紐，舉辦了一系列大型活動及針對性宣傳活動。為提升香港的軟實力，香港金融學院（AoF）於6月設立，以制定金融領導力及推動研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行及監管界別中，香港金融管理局在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。香港金融管理局曾於2019年8月31日前擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）的監管與合作常設委員會（SRC）主席。現時，香港金融管理局正擔任巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（Basel Committee）的監理與落實小組（SIG）主席，以及東亞及太平洋區中央銀行高級管理人員會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）主席。香港金融管理局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）的非銀行監測專家小組（NMEG）主席。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心奠定了穩固的根基。四個銀行間即時全額結算系統（RTGS）、中央結算及交收系統（CMU）及香港儲存庫（HKTR）在2019年取得100%的系統可用率，超越了99.95%的目標。透過與兩家內地中央證券存管機構設立的賬戶，中央結算及交收系統協助進行北向債券通交易的結算，並代表相關會員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快作為港元即時支付系統的延伸，使公眾能全天候跨不同銀行及儲值設施（SVFs）進行即時零售資金轉帳及付款，其在首個運作年順暢。用戶對該設施的採用率持續增加，截至年底已達四百萬登記數目及交易量增長兩倍。轉數快為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，香港金融管理局已指定並監察根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）運作的六個零售支付系統（RPSs）。香港金融管理局亦於5月發出兩張新的儲值支付工具（SVF）牌照，使SVF牌照持有人數目增至18。SVF牌照持有人在今年繼續積極推出新產品及服務，以多元化客戶選擇及提升用戶體驗。\n\n# 2019年檢討\n\n# 亞洲金融科技樞紐：香港\n\n# 智慧銀行創新方案\n\n香港金融管理局於2017年9月公布了七項智慧銀行措施，旨在協助銀行業提升運作標準，並把握銀行與科技融合帶來的龐大機遇。在這一年中，這些措施的實施取得了大量進展，並推動了香港金融科技生態系統的轉型。\n\n# 更快支付系統\n\n2018年9月推出的轉數快系統是香港在數位時代金融基礎建設發展的重大里程碑。轉數快系統進一步推動香港採用電子支付，透過為公眾及企業提供高效及方便的支付服務。自轉數快系統推出以來，參與服務供應商的數目已增加至30間銀行及11間SVF，至2019年底更增加9間銀行及1間SVF。\n\n轉數快的使用量亦穩定增長。截至2019年12月31日，轉數快記錄了四百萬宗登記數目（圖1），並處理了4400萬宗交易，總金額達港幣748.5億及人民幣170億。2019年12月，每日平均成交額達到168,000宗交易，價值港幣2.4億及人民幣3800萬（圖2），相比2018年10月其首個完整運作月份的51,000宗交易。\n\n更快支付系統記錄：\n- 2019年12月31日，登記數目達4百萬\n- 2019年12月31日，交易筆數達44百萬\n- 2019年12月，金管局平均每日成交額為港幣2.4億及人民幣38百萬，共有168,000宗交易。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界合作，將轉數快的使用範圍從個人對個人付款擴展至法案付款及其他商戶付款。例如，作出改進，使商戶能夠利用不同類型的代理識別符號，並透過二維碼接受部分或過付。已制定技術守則，以促進從商業手機應用程式打開手機銀行或SVF電子錢包手機應用程式（app），進行轉數快付款。這將大大改善客戶透過轉數快使用行動設備進行商戶及商業付款的體驗。\n\n香港金融管理局亦與相關政府部門緊密合作，協助他們利用轉數快接受公眾的帳單。自11月1日起，稅務局、地政估值科及水務署發出的帳單均印有轉數快二維碼，讓公眾可透過支援的流動銀行應用程式或SVF電子錢包應用程式輕易掃描二維碼進行繳費。香港金融管理局將繼續與各項政府部門及公營機構合作，探索其他潛在應用情況，以提供更方便公眾透過轉數快繳費的方案。\n\n為提高公眾對轉數快的認識，香港金融管理局推出一系列新的教育及宣傳資料，例如在電視及電台播放的宣傳片，以及用於數碼平台的視頻及電子橫額。香港金融管理局亦參與博覽會，向中小企及企業推動轉數快。各項參與轉數快的銀行及支付通訊服務提供者推出推廣宣傳活動，並提供鼓勵措施，以鼓勵客戶註冊轉數快，並用轉數快進行資金轉賬及支付賬單。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局聘請多家業界組織和機構，就轉數快進行簡報，以推出其功能，以及介紹其在收款及支付款項方面可能為不同企業帶來的潛在好處。\n\n政府已採用轉數快為稅款、差餉及地租和水費的繳費方式。\n\n# 開放應用程式程式介面\n\n香港金融管理局繼續促進銀行業發展及採用開放API，根據開放API框架的四階段方法。在第一階段，20間零售銀行於1月開立超過500個開放API端點，涵蓋銀行產品及服務的資訊。在第二階段，銀行於10月開立超過300個API，支持銀行產品及服務的應用。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n在貿易融資方面，一項關於連結eTradeConnect與we.trade的試驗已於首個季度完成。11月，香港銀行清算結算有限公司的子公司與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所簽署了《諒解備忘錄》，以進行連結eTradeConnect與中國人民銀行貿易融資平台的試驗，為香港與內地企業提供更方便的貿易融資服務。\n\n關於中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC），香港金融管理局與泰國央行開展了一項名為Inthanon-LionRock的聯合研究項目，研究CBDC在跨境支付中的應用，期望促進香港與泰國銀行之間的支付對支付（pvp）。\n\n香港金融管理局金融基礎設施執行總監彭志豪先生（左起首個），與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所所長穆長春先生（右起首個），一同見證簽署《諒解備忘錄》的簽署儀式，以進行將eTradeConnect與中國人民銀行貿易融資平台連接的試驗。該《諒解備忘錄》由香港貿易融資平台有限公司首席營運官唐慧星女士（左起第二個）與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所副所長兼深圳金融科技研究院院長狄剛先生（右起第二個）簽署。\n\n關於人工（智能）(認可機構)，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了一項研究，探討人工（智能）技術在香港銀行業的應用。一項廣泛的認可機構調查的關鍵發現於11月刊登，隨後於12月發佈了題為「以人工（智能）重塑銀行業」的十足報告。\n\n報告《以人工智慧重塑銀行業》於12月刊登。\n\n一份事實簡報已刊登，以突出從有關香港銀行業使用認可機構的調查中得出的關鍵事實和數字。\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局繼續與其戰略夥伴合作，推行「金融科技事業加速計劃2.0」，以培育不同階段的年青人才。去年超過220名學生受惠於該計劃。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in

儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場在2019年表現更好於預期，因為主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的影響大於對全球增長放緩及中美貿易摩擦的擔憂。全球股市在2018年第4季經歷重大調整後反彈，同時主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上漲。在這樣利好的環境下，金管局在2019年記錄了2,622億港元的投資收入，相當於6.6%的投資回報率。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n交換基金的首要目標，如《交換基金條例》所制定，是影響香港貨幣的匯率，或直接或間接。基金亦可運用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以幫助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局在財政司司長（FS）授權下，並在轉授的條款內，對交換基金的運用及投資管理負責。\n\n# 外匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已設立以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎隨時皆由高度流動性的美元計價資產十足支持；\n(c) 確保足夠流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；\n(d) 受(a)至(c)之限制，取得一項投資回報，以幫助基金保有長線購買力。\n\n這些目標已十足考慮了匯款基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n\n匯換基金大致上擁有兩項重大投資組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流動性的美元資產，以致於可為貨幣基礎提供十足支持，符合貨幣板安排的規定。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股權市場，以保本並維持其資產的長線購買力。\n\n為在中長期更好地管理風險並提升回報，香港金融管理局以審慎及漸進的方式，將匯兌基金的部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長線增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP下投資的市場價值上限，設為匯兌基金累積結餘的三分之一，加上與LTGP掛鈎的未來基金及匯兌基金子公司投資的相關部分。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年設立，持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由政府代表滙豐基金為戰略目的購入。由於其獨特性，此投資組合並未被包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 交換基金的投資安排\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# 投資流程\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程以兩類資產配置的決定為支持：戰略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資標竿中，代表鑒於聯匯基金的投資目標所作出的長線資產配置。以...作指引，資產會戰略性地配置，以爭取在標竿之上取得額外回報。這表示實際配置往往不同於標竿（或戰略性）配置。實際配置與標竿配置之間的差距稱為「戰術性偏差」。雖然標竿和追蹤誤差上限由金管局與聯匯基金顧問委員會共同決定，但戰術性決定及戰術性偏差的範圍則由香港金融管理局在授權下作出並設立。在允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以選持倉盤，以利用短期市場變化。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2018年8月設立了外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以統籌其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO的員工直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括整個BP及部分IP。這部分IP包括一組投資於全球定息市場的投資組合，以及各項實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具疊加投資組合。\n\n# 運用外部經理\n\n此外，香港金融管理局除內部管理資產外，聘請外部基金經理管理約29%的發行基金資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他專業資產類別。聘請外部基金經理的目的是為了取得市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，汲取多樣化且互補的投資風格，並獲得他們在市場洞察及投資技術方面的專業知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理和託管費用、交易成本，以及扣繳及其他費用。此支出主要由市場因素決定，可能每年有所變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的複雜度日益增加，突顯了風險管理的重要性。內部和外部管理的投資組合均已實施了嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並且緊密監察對指引和法規的遵守情況。隨著投資環境的複雜度增加，風險評估已得到加強，以支持匯兌基金投資多元化的增長。風險控制工具被部署以評估在正常和不利市場條件下的市場風險。同時，亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，支持香港金融管理局評估如何最佳地運用內部和外部管理者的投資技巧。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素併入交易所基金的公眾及私人市場投資過程，以促進負責任投資（RI）。\n\n就公眾市場投資而言，金管局實施與程序相關及與投資相關的措施。金管局採納了一項與程序相關的措施，即採用證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《責任投資原則》（PRO），以幫助投資者決定如何最佳地滿足其在香港上市公司的股東責任。在管理投資基金方面，金管局已制定內部指引，涵蓋甄選、委任及監察外部基金經理過程中的環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素。金管局委任的外部基金經理，負責管理其香港股市及內地活躍股市組合的投資，須根據「符合或說明」的原則恪守PRO；而委任管理金管局於發達市場股票投資組合的外部基金經理，則需要恪守國際公認的環境、社會及管治標準。除了外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦已納入金管局內部管理債券投資的信貸風險分析中。\n\n至於公眾市場的環境、社會及管治投資，香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2015年起作為先驅投資者之一，投資於綠色債券，並參與由國際金融公司（IFC）管理的聯合貸款計劃，該計劃重點關注新興市場的可持續投資。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續增長其綠色債券組合，或透過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金。香港金融管理局亦計劃在股權投資中建立以ESG為主題的投資策略，採納環境、社會及管治股權指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並聘用將環境、社會及管治因素納入考量的主動股權經理。\n\n在私人市場投資方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）會在其盡職調查過程中檢視一般合夥人的環境、社會及管治（ESG）政策與實踐。特別是，ESG風險評估會作為盡職調查的強制性部分進行，適用於所有長期一般合夥（LTGP）投資。對於LTGP，香港金融管理局投資具有可持續特點的項目；例如，自2013年起，香港金融管理局在能源領域的直接投資與共同投資中，投資於可再生能源，以及在其房地產投資組合中投資於綠色建築物和倉庫，這些均具備綠色及可持續的特點。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續尋找具有可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資中將綠色認證作為重要考量因素。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將緊密監察環境、社會及管治（ESG）標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入其投資流程。此過程透過與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作而得以推進。特別是，作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則的簽署方，該原則是全球領先的責任投資倡議平台，香港金融管理局預期將參與制定環境、社會及管治的最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦是FCLTGlobal的成員，這是一個非牟利組織，致力於透過研討會和研究工作，鼓勵企業及投資決策中採用長遠觀點。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作小組的支持者。\n\n如需了解更多關於金管局RI政策框架的細則，請參閱《企業社會責任》章節。\n\n# 基金績效\n\n# 2019年金融市場\n\n儘管對全球經濟增長放緩和美中貿易摩擦有所擔憂，全球金融市場在2019年表現良好，受益於主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策。隨着2018年第4季的重大調整，全球股市在2019年反彈。在債券市場，主要政府債券收益率顯著下跌，而債券價格在2019年的首三個季度因貨幣寬鬆而上漲。儘管債券價格在第4季因收益率略為反彈而回落，但2019年債券市場的整體收益仍然令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場中，主要貨幣對美元的表現各不相同。由於中美貿易摩擦的升溫，人民幣在第三季度下跌了3.8%，但隨著貿易摩擦緩和，人民幣在第4季部分收復了較早前的跌幅。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。雖然由於無協議脫歐風險增加，英鎊在第三季度下跌了3.2%，但隨著第四季脫歐局勢明朗化，英鎊最終大幅反彈，對美元增強了4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現見表1。\n\n# 聯匯基金的表現\n\n金管局在2019年記錄了投資收益2,622億港元。此收益包括債券收益1,145億港元、香港股票收益221億港元、其他股票收益1,007億港元、非港元資產的負匯兌影響130億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益37.9億港元。另一方面，戰略投資組合記錄了估值收益2.5億港元。\n\n香港儲備基金的總資產在年底達到金管局4,206.7億。根據長期流動性激勵計劃的投資總計335.1億，其中私募股權為233.4億，房地產則為1,017億。未償投資承諾達到219.3億。\n\n2019年，聯匯基金（不包括策略投資組合）的投資回報為6.6%。具體而言，IP 取得 9.7% 的回報率，而 Bp 則增長了 2.5%。自 2009 年成立以來，LTGP 記錄了年化內部回報率為 12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

內 部，金管局積極推動改善公司治理，支持員工專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律、提升資訊科技安全，並推動創新文化，以應對因落實新措施及工作複雜度增加而帶來 的挑戰。\n\n# 聘用社區\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局緊密與媒體合作，以提升透明度及推動公眾對其政策及工作之了解。本年共舉辦125場開放記者會，包括10場會議、12場即場訪問及103項其他公眾活動。另安排25場媒體訪問。共發佈466份雙語新聞稿，每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高各界對金管局主要職能的認識，金管局舉辦了媒體簡報會及教育研討會，針對本地及海外媒體以及社區的重要意見領袖，以促進對廣泛主題的了解，例如聯繫匯率制度（LERS）、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為競爭力國際金融中心的地位。\n\n自2018年7月起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）推出各項社交媒體渠道，以加強公眾教育和溝通。現時共有5個社交媒體渠道在運作：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube，截至2019年底，總共有超過45,000名用戶。在2019年下半年的社會事件之下，HKMA利用社交媒體反駁有關銀行營運及金融穩定的謠言，此舉證明高度有效，有助於傳播事實並防止謠言散播。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務提供一種有效方式，讓公眾更好地了解金管局的主要功能及營運。2019年共處理了9,742宗查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策及規則、消費者銀行服務以及紙幣和硬幣相關。顯著的查詢包括硬幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函、轉數快（FPS）以及貨幣和經濟統計。\n\n圖1顯示自2016年起公共查詢數目，圖2提供2019年按查詢性質的分類。\n\n香港金融管理局執行總裁黃蘊財先生，於香港銀行團體傑出講者午宴上發言。\n\n香港金融管理局局長葉國華先生（左），與當時香港金融管理局局長陳德霖先生，在公布葉國華先生獲委任為香港金融管理局下任局長後，會見媒體。\n\n# 研究報告\n\n除了香港金融管理局年度報告外，2019年香港金融管理局刊登了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告、四期季度通訊及定期更新的月度統計通訊，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新資料及主題分析。此外，香港金融管理局刊登了19篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的各項主題。inSight文章為香港金融管理局提供一個有用的渠道，以闡釋其重大新舉措或政策的理據，並對公眾關注的時事問題作出適時回應。\n\n# 香港金管局網站\n\n金管局官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過4萬頁的內容，以英文、傳統及簡體中文呈現，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦包含根據《銀行條例》第20條保持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及AIs證券人員的紀錄冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值憑證條例》保持的儲值設施（SVF）牌照持有人的紀錄冊。金管局官方網站於9月進行了重大翻新，並以新設計佈局、豐富內容、加強導覽結構及更方便的搜尋功能重新推出。翻新後的網站讓用戶能更方便地根據個人喜好搜尋資訊。特別是，翻新後的網站新增了「聰明消費者」專欄，公眾可在其中發現有關廣泛銀行及相關產品或服務的有用資訊及聰明小貼士。這與金管局一向推動「聰明及負責任」使用銀行服務的努力符合。\n\n香港金融管理局推出全新改版的網站。\n\n翻新後的香港金融管理局網站設有「新」智慧消費者專區。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2018年起分階段透過開放應用程式程式設計介面（API），開放其網站上發布的財務數據及重要資訊。至2019年，金管局已按原計劃在其網站上開放了130組開放API。金管局積極支持開放API的發展與應用。\n\n# 香港金融管理局資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社區介紹香港金融管理局工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心包括展覽區及圖書館，並每周開放六天。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展情況。它亦包含有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n香港金融管理局於本年完成了資訊中心「歷史時間軸」的全面更新。翻新的歷史時間軸以多媒體及數碼展示板為特色，讓訪問學者能以更互動的方式檢討香港及全球的重大貨幣及金融事件，並於10月重新開幕。\n\n歷史時間軸的首個部分由多媒體展示面板組成，介紹從1842年至1993年的重大事件。\n\n歷史時間軸的第二部分為一個數位顯示面板，介紹自1993年HKMA設立以來至今的重大事件。\n\n資訊中心為訪問學者安排導賞服務。在這一年內，它接獲超過48,000名訪問學者，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過480次導賞服務（圖3）。自2003年12月開立以來，已有超過753,000名市民到訪資訊中心。\n\n資訊中心為學校及其他訪問學者舉辦以...作指引的導賞服務。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，館藏超過26,000冊書籍、期刊及其他研究報告，用以研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行主題。根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，圖書館亦負責保管持牌機構及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及持牌機構證券人員的紀錄冊。\n\n# 公眾與消費者教育\n\n為接觸社區並提高公眾對金管局工作的認識，金管局於2019年舉辦了一場公開教育研討會，邀請超過400名中學學生及教師參與。研討會主題包括介紹金管局的工作、香港紙幣、轉數快、儲值支付工具、金融科技及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃推出以來，已有超過六成名教師及學生參與此計劃。\n\n來自不同區中學的學生和教師參加2019年公共教育研討會。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度消費者教育倡議的重點，是教育公眾保護他們的「個人數碼鑰匙」。這個概念被引入以幫助公眾視覺化保障資訊以使用他們的網上帳戶的重要性。核心訊息是，在數碼世界中，帳戶登入細則及與網上銀行及其他數碼金融服務相關的個人資料，與家門的鑰匙一樣重要，應予以良好保護。透過安排在不同媒體進行推廣，包括電視、電台、手機應用程式、社交媒體及其他平台，以突出如何保護個人數碼鑰匙的智慧提示。\n\n個人數位密鑰旗艦活動透過廣泛的媒體推廣進行。\n\n持續的措施亦被推行，以教育公眾成為聰明且負責任的金融消費者。例如，提醒公眾保持警覺，注意冒充銀行的詐騙電話，以及在媒體上宣傳的投資詐騙。處理個人信貸產品時需注意的問題，特別是在納稅季節借出個人貸款，亦被推廣。\n\n為提升中學生當中的財務素養，香港金管局與各項持份者連續第五年舉辦「香港通識教育財務素養錦標賽」。今年錦標賽首次運用資訊圖表，幫助學生更深入了解複雜的財務概念。一場網上測驗進行，吸引了 10,450 份參與，最終在香港金管局舉辦了首個總決賽。\n\n錦標賽吸引逾10,000份網上投稿，最終以在香港金融管理局舉行的現場比賽作結。\n\n在該年，香港金融管理局展開了其跨代別推廣教育計劃的第二階段，該計劃與一所教育機構聯合舉辦。計劃包括銀行模擬遊戲、家長研討會及培訓講師工作坊，目標對象為幼稚園學生、他們的家長和教師，以及年青人。其他年青人教育的舉措包括與一間專業團體聯合製作小學學生和家長的漫畫故事書，以及向大專學生提供研討會。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續支持投資者及財務教育委員會，推動香港的金融知識及能力，並將探索與不同持份者進一步合作，以最大化消費者教育的影響。\n\n跨世代外展計畫首個階段的成就發布會，一同推出第二階段。\n\n幼稚園學生參與銀行模擬遊戲。\n\n漫畫故事書是與專業團體聯合製作，用以向小學生及其家長傳播使用銀行及金融服務的智慧提示。\n\n# 我們的市民\n\n雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要**部分**，但它**聘請**員工的**條款**與公務員制度**不同**，以吸引具有合適**經驗**和專業知識的**人士**。香港金融管理局招聘、發展並**保持**一支**高度**專業的**工作**隊伍，以**支持**其政策目標，並**靈活**地**回應**變化的**工作**優先事項。\n\n香港金管局於2019年的編制為1,005個。當年，香港金管局進行了一項跨部門的流程再造行動，以提升各項工作流程的效率，並重新調配現有資源以支持新舉措。由於這項嚴格的行動，香港金管局2020年的整體編制保持不變，仍為1,005個。資源已重新調配以執行以下新任務：\n\n# 銀行業與金融穩定\n- 制定並實施針對虛擬銀行的監管制度，並應對日益複雜的審慎監管標準\n- 提升對保險中介機構的新監管制度的監管能力\n- 加強對銀行文化改革的持續監測，並持續監督銀行及其他相關提供信託服務的機構\n\n# 儲備管理\n- 加強投資及風險管理及其他必要支持，以促進交易所基金投資活動的進一步增長和多元化。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心\n- 支持改革以提升香港稅制在不同金融服務領域的國際競爭力。\n- 提升每日對交易倉儲數據的質性市場監察及分析。\n\n表1概述了香港金融管理局的設立及實力。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據治理小組委員會（GSC）透過匯率基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）的意見，考慮現行市場薪酬水平及慣例，決定香港金管局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括總現金方案及公積金計劃，福利方面則基本。現金方案包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，該浮動薪酬可能根據表現，每年以合共形式頒發給個別職員。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬由財務署（FS）每年根據金管局人事委員會（GSC）透過eFAC向其提出的建議進行檢視，建議內容會考慮金管局上一年度的表現評估、由獨立人力資源顧問機構進行的金融界薪酬調查發現，以及其他相關因素。為獎勵表現卓越的個別員工，並維持薪酬的競爭力，有需要時可能會作出特別的薪酬調整。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to

企業社會責任\n\n香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，並以成為一個負責任且可持續的組織為目標。此承諾體現在各項範疇，包括推動可持續及環保的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境及培育友善的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色與可持續銀行業\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉和全球經濟可持續發展的重大風險之一。銀行業作為社會的重要組成部分，其運作亦會受到影響，因此應更積極地管理氣候風險。香港金融管理局致力於探討應對此挑戰的方法。在此背景下，香港金融管理局於5月公布了一系列推動香港綠色金融發展的措施，包括採用三個階段的方法推動綠色及可持續銀行業。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n作為交易所基金的投資管理人，香港金融管理局認為，責任投資（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於香港金融管理局是全球最大的資產擁有者之一，它將對基金經理的資產選擇產生重大影響。\n\n# 我們的理念\n\n香港金融管理局視RI為一種投資方法，在考慮各項環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素對長線投資回報及其可持續性的影響。香港金融管理局認為，透過強調適當的RI及可持續的長線經濟表現，可以更有效取得交易所基金的投資目標，並減少其基礎投資之相關ESG事宜所帶來的風險。\n\n# 我們的原則\n\n香港金融管理局的指導原則是，若長線風險調整後的回報與其他投資相若，則一般會優先考慮環境、社會及管治投資。鑒於適當情況，香港金融管理局在其投資過程中採用以下原則，這些原則體現了其作為負責任長線投資者的理念。\n\n# 整合\n\n香港金管局將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入其投資分析流程，以篩選風險及機遇，因其認為這些因素可能對其投資的長線價值產生影響。具體而言，金管局已將ESG因素納入公共及私營市場投資的投資過程。對於公共市場投資，金管局在其債券投資的信貸風險分析中納入環境、社會及管治因素。與金管局分享其責任投資理念的外部經理會被篩選並委任。金管局向所有外部經理傳達其責任投資理念，並預期他們配合，使整體可持續的長線經濟表現目標得以實現。對於私營市場投資，金管局會檢視其普通合伙人的環境、社會及管治政策和實務，作為其盡職調查過程的一部分。\n\n# 積極參與所有權\n\n香港金融管理局以一種有助保障其投資長線價值的方式，行使其持有的公眾股權的股東權利。金管局相信，以環境、社會及管治因素為指引的負責任企業行為，將有助於長線創造股東價值。金管局的資產管理人預期會透過行使投票權及與相關企業溝通，採納積極股權參與，協助金管局履行其在相關投資中的股東責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n香港金融管理局致力攜手理念相近的投資者及監管機構，推動長線投資管理的良好實踐。其參與並在公開活動上發表演講，分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用RI。\n\n請參閱儲備管理章節，以了解香港金融管理局在本年就RI所進行的工作細則。\n\n# 推動金融包容\n\n香港金融管理局重視金融包容性，並已付出重大努力，以推動不同社會群體獲得基本的銀行服務，以滿足一般公眾的日常基本需要以及合法企業的營運需要。特別是，香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界緊密合作，優先考慮以下範疇：\n\n鼓勵銀行推出更多實體銀行設施，並制定數碼及創新渠道，以方便一般大眾，特別是偏遠地區及公共屋邨的居民，以及長者。\n\n促進及監察銀行帳戶向個人和中小企的 접근性。\n\n提升銀行服務對具體客戶群體的易達性，例如，身心障礙人士和少數族裔。\n\n促進及監督中小企獲得銀行信貸的可及性；以及\n\n授予8間虛擬銀行許可證，這些銀行在提供銀行服務時將積極推動金融包容性。\n\n# 社群\n\n# 推動財務素養\n\n香港金融管理局推動財務素養，透過各項渠道進行。除了運作教育計劃，以推動公眾聰明及負責任地運用銀行及金融服務外，金融管理局在其更新後的官方網站上設有專門的「精明消費者」版塊，公眾可在該版塊中找到有關廣泛銀行及相關產品及服務的有用資訊和聰明技巧。此外，金融管理局還運用Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram和Twitter等媒體平台，以及官方網站和研究報告，提供最新的銀行及金融事務資訊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心，自2003年起作為金管局的重大公眾教育及研究資源，介紹金管局的工作，並推動大眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。每日提供導賞團予來自學校及非牟利機構的學生團體。此外，亦舉辦公眾教育講座及其他活動，以提升學生的財務知識及素養。金管局亦與投資者及財務教育委員會緊密合作，透過其財務教育平台陳氏家族，在香港推動財務素養。\n\n請參閱「企業功能」一章，以取得更多關於香港金融管理局在本年度推動財務素養工作的細則。請參閱「銀行穩定」一章，以取得更多關於香港金融管理局在本年度推動財務包容性的細則。\n\n# 應對特殊群體需要\n\n# 香港紙幣的可及性\n\n2018年紙幣系列保留了上一系列紙幣中以幫助視障人士區分面額的可及性特點。這些可及性特點包括點字、觸覺線條和高觸覺數字。\n\n為幫助視障人士區分紙幣的面額，一款由香港金融管理局贊助、香港盲人社會開發的手機應用程式，會利用手機的相機掃描紙幣圖案以辨識面額。此應用程式可於Apple App Store及Google Play Store免費下載。香港金融管理局與三間發行紙幣的銀行亦贊助了一款紙幣測量模板，用以測量紙幣的長度。該模板可測量2018系列紙幣及現時流通的紙幣。模板一面凸印點字，另一面則印有符號，並免費分發至服務視障人士的志願機構。\n\n# 硬幣收藏活動\n\n在「硬幣收集」計劃下，香港金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，採取硬幣推車於旗日收集非政府組織的硬幣。\n\n# 公共資訊的可及性\n\n香港金融管理局的改版官方網站於9月推出。改版後的網站加強了導覽結構，以根據用戶的個人偏好促進更方便的搜尋。特別是，網站在「智慧消費者」專欄下設有專頁「其他語言資訊」，提供有用資訊，介紹少數族裔社群運用之七種語言的銀行服務，包括印尼語、印地語、尼泊爾語、旁遮普語、他加祿語、泰語和烏爾都語。\n\n香港金融管理局致力確保其網站符合萬維網聯盟（W3C）網頁內容可及性指南（WCAG）2.0 AA級標準，以促進市民有需要的人士無障礙地訪問網上資訊。\n\n# 志願服務及慈善活動\n\n香港金融管理局一向支持社區服務，透過參與志願及慈善活動，貢獻一份力量。長者家居安全團體頒發社區參與水晶獎予香港金融管理局，以表彰其參與2018年愛與安心企業參與計劃。\n\n香港金管局志願者團隊在2019年參與的慈善活動。\n\n「Yo！讓我們走這條路」由年青人外展\n\n藝術家及該社會企業「Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong」的代表，到金管局參觀，他們的藝術品在那裡展示。\n\nHKMA 會員積極參與獻血日、全港升旗日、香港賽馬會慈善信托基金的綠色日、愛牙日、跳過午飯日、休閒日以及定期舉辦的衣物、玩具及其他可重用物品收集活動，以捐贈給慈善團體。\n\n香港金融管理局員工積極參與香港紅十字會舉辦的獻血日。\n\n# 友善組織\n\n為表彰其對社區的友善承諾，香港金融管理局連續第13年獲香港社會服務聯會頒發「10 Years Plus 友善機構標誌」。\n\n# 環境\n\n# 綠色辦公措施\n\n香港金融管理局已設立一項環保政策，以保護及保本環境。該政策及落實措施會定期向其員工公布。綠色辦公室措施包括：\n\n# 紙張\/影印\/印刷\n\n- 鼓勵使用回收紙張和信封；\n分發電子文件副本，而非紙本文件副本；\n- 在紙張兩面印刷；\n- 僅在必要時使用彩色印刷和複製；\n- 避免使用紙杯；以及\n- 使用環保紙張和油墨為香港金融管理局的年度報告。\n\n# 耗電量\n\n關掉電腦、印表機、燈光、音響視訊系統及其他電動設備，在這些設備未使用時。使用後重新啟動大多數設備（如飲水機、電動打孔機和碎紙機）的預設節能模式；並且定期檢視是否需要額外空調，超出正常辦公時間。\n\n# 回收\n\n善用回收箱收集不同類別的廢物，包括紙張、罐頭、瓶子、電池、光碟和墨盒。\n\n# 工作環境\n\n# 多元與包容\n\n# 平等機遇政策\n\n香港金融管理局是平等機會僱主。它相信每個人都應能在無歧視、騷擾、貶損及報復的環境中工作。平等機會政策適用於招聘廣告、職位招聘、條款及就業條件、工作表現評估、推廣、調職、培訓、解僱、投訴程序及一般行為準則。\n\n# 多元性關鍵統計數據\n\n市民是香港金融管理局工作的核心。我們重視員工的多樣性，其中包括均衡的性別比例和不同年齡層。\n\n高級管理層，即執行總裁及以上層級的女性佔比為31%，截至2020年2月。\n\n# 2020年1月1日人力資本關鍵統計數據\n\n# 優質的工作環境\n\n為應付預期的運作需要，香港金融管理局於本年度翻新辦公室，以創造開放式布局、增加容量及讓空間得以更高效利用。休息區及符合人體工學的家具是新辦公室設計的一部分。為提升員工的體格健康，管理局為員工提供可調高度的辦公桌，讓他們在一天當中容易地在坐與站之間改變姿勢。\n\n升降桌改善辦公室人體工學。\n\n#

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be

意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了香港儲備基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）第187頁至293頁所載的財務報表，該財務報表包括香港儲備基金及本集團於2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該年終止日止的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附注，其中包含重大會計政策概要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公允地反映了基金及本集團於2019年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至該年止的財務表現及現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「HKFRSs」），根據香港特許會計師公會（「HKICPA」）的指示，且已根據《交易基金條例》(第66章) 第7條所作出的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7日作出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行了我的審計。我在這些標準下的責任，進一步說明於我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與該集團保持獨立，並已根據這些標準履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我取得的審計證據足夠且適當，可作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指，在我專業判斷下，於審計2019年12月31日止年度財務報表時最重要的事項。這些事項是在我對財務報表整體審計的背景下討論的，並且在形成我的意見時考慮到，我並未就這些事項提供單獨意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債以公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5%、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為金管局3,874,223百萬，金融負債總額為金管局1,158,686百萬，按公允價值計量。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 91% 以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層級輸入）或根據可觀察市場數據利用估值技術估算（第二層級輸入）。\n\n對於這些金融資產中餘下的9%，其公允價值是根據估值技術進行估算，而這些技術的輸入數據並非基於可觀察的市場數據（第三層輸入）。這些金融資產總計為338,758百萬港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於金額龐大且涉及的估計，以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債是關鍵審計事項。\n\n對按公允價值計量的金融資產和金融負債進行審計的程序包括：\n\n取得對用以評估不同類別金融資產和金融負債之程序，包括相關控制措施的了解。\n\n評估和測試控制，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制。\n\n取得有關金融資產及金融負債之估值、存在性、權利與義務及完整性之外部確認。\n\n在引用市場價格時，運用獨立來源驗證價格。\n\n在運用以可觀察市場數據為根據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性及假設的合理性，並核證輸入數據至獨立來源；以及\n\n在運用未根據可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性，並檢討假設和輸入的合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產根據公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列示，截至2019年12月31日總值為港幣22,481百萬。集團亦持有兩家合資企業的權益，總值為港幣44,506百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由集團直接持有或由合資企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。有關估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所運用估值方法及所運用假設。\n\n對投資物業以公允價值估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱本集團直接或透過合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平價值是根據估值報告中列示的估值而確定。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性和資歷；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適合性以及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n當局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港貨幣當局2019年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我對此並未表達任何形式的結論。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在進行此項工作時，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則顯得有重大錯誤。根據我所進行的工作，若我認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我須報告此一事實。我無需就此報告任何事項。\n\n# 金融管理局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣當局負責準備符合香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官作出指示的財務報表，並負責建立貨幣當局認為必要的一切內部控制，以使財務報表免受因訛騙或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤。\n\n在準備財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團的持續經營能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，利用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會轄下的審計小組負責監察集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師的責任為審計財務報表\n\n我的目標是取得合理確信，以確認財務報表整體而言沒有重大錯報，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致，並發行一份包括我意見的審計報告。合理確信是一種高程度的確信，但並非保證，即使按照審計委員會的審計標準進行，審計也可能無法發現已存在的重大錯報。這些錯報可能源於訛騙或錯誤，並且如果單獨或總計來看，合理地預期會影響基於這些財務報表的決策。\n\n作為審計署審計準則下審計的**部分**，我**運用**專業判斷，並**維持**專業懷疑態度。**我也**：\n\n識別並評估財務報表中重大誤報的風險，無論是因訛騙或錯誤所致，設計並執行相關的審計程序，以取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我意見的基礎。因訛騙導致的重大誤報風險，高於因錯誤導致的風險，因為訛騙可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制的情況。\n\n取得與審計相關的內部控制了解，以設計適當於情況的審計程序，但非為發表對集團內部控制成效之意見。\n\n評估所運用會計政策的適合性，以及當局作出的會計估計和相關披露的合理性。\n\n就當局採用持續經營基礎進行會計的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我結論認為存在重大不確定性，我規定需要在我的審計報告中關注財務報表中相關的披露，如果這些披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我審計報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或情況可能造成集團無法繼續持續經營。\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括相關的披露事項，以及財務報表是否以適當的方式反映了相關交易和事件，以達成公平呈現；並取得足夠適當的審計證據，以就集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我維持對我的審計意見負有唯一責任。\n\n我聯繫聯匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組，有關審計的計劃範圍及時間安排，以及重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中發現到的任何重大內部監控不足之處。\n\n我亦向財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供一份報告，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們聯繫所有可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，採取相關保障措施。\n\n從與聯匯基金審計委員會審計小組溝通的事項中，我決定哪些事項在審計本期間的財務報表時最具重要性，因此為關鍵審計事項。我會在審計報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或監管不允許公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項，因為這樣做的不利後果將合理預期會超過此類溝通的福利。\n\nJohn
