{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","en":"# CEO Report\n\nIn 2016, the global political and economic landscape was marked by frequent \"black swan\" events. While the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election results defied most predictions, the financial markets’ reaction was even more surprising. For example, news of Donald Trump’s victory initially sent futures on the three major U.S. stock indices plummeting before the market opened, but they quickly rebounded, subsequently reaching new highs. These events underscored the limitations of conventional wisdom in predicting market behavior and signaled a significant degree of uncertainty in the future trajectory of global affairs.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial indicators have reflected heightened market volatility. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July, then surged to 2.6% in mid-December following the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar's performance against a basket of currencies, reached a 14-year high by year-end. Meanwhile, New York crude oil futures prices rebounded from a low of $26 per barrel at the beginning of the year to $54 per barrel by year-end. In Hong Kong's stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 86 points for the year, though the peak-to-trough difference during the period exceeded 6,000 points. Amidst this volatile external environment, the stability of the financial system—particularly the banking and monetary sectors—has become even more crucial.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors of international hedge funds targeting the Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar gained traction, causing market anxiety. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly issued clear and resolute messages, affirming its full confidence and capability in defending the linked exchange rate system and maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system, thereby stabilizing market sentiment. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained consistently close to the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Due to ample liquidity within the banking system, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in December 2015 and March 2016 had no significant immediate impact on Hong Kong dollar interest rates or exchange rates.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system continues to develop steadily. Last year, overall loans grew by a moderate 6.5%, and asset quality remained strong. The ratio of non-performing loans was maintained at a healthy 0.85%, well below the long-term average of approximately 2% since 2000. Both the banking system’s capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio remained at high levels exceeding regulatory requirements.\nIn the mortgage sector, following seven rounds of countercyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages decreased from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing a necessary buffer should the property market cycle reverse and impact the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor developments in the property market and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nLegislative efforts to strengthen the stability of the banking system made significant progress last year. Two key pieces of legislation—designed to improve the deposit insurance system and address risks associated with institutions that are \"too big to fail\"—were successfully passed before the end of the previous Legislative Council term. The first measure accelerates the disbursement of deposit insurance funds and simplifies the process, bolstering depositor confidence in the banking system. The second establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks that could arise from their failure and to minimize the need for public funds to provide financial assistance. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established a Resolution Mechanism Office on April 1st of this year to implement the legislation and oversee related follow-up work.\n\nThe banking sector is vital to Hong Kong's economy, serving as a key channel for savings, payments, and credit for businesses and individuals. This year, some small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) representatives reported facing difficulties in securing financing. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) immediately engaged with the banking sector, encouraging banks to continue supporting SME operations and development while maintaining prudent risk management. We also strengthened the promotion of the government’s SME Financing Guarantee Scheme through the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, and worked closely with banks to address concerns, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for bad debts, thereby encouraging their participation in the scheme. These efforts have yielded positive results. According to an HKMA survey of banks, overall SME credit limits remained stable last year, with over 90% of businesses maintaining or even increasing their limits. Simultaneously, applications for the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme have also risen significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been actively promoting financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services are essential for both business operations and daily life. Last year, upon learning that some overseas companies and start-ups were encountering difficulties opening accounts in Hong Kong, we promptly initiated follow-up efforts, engaging with multiple international chambers of commerce and business associations and conducting in-depth discussions with the banking sector to implement targeted solutions. In September of last year, I issued a circular to all Hong Kong banks, clarifying how to interpret the HKMA’s risk-based regulatory principles concerning anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and how to apply these principles to account opening applications and know your customer procedures for existing clients. I emphasized that banks should not adopt a uniform approach to customer requirements and procedures. Following consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account openings has improved, but further progress remains a key priority this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also depends on the reach of bank branch services. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently encouraged banks to consider the basic banking needs of the public while also seeking profit. With the rapid development of financial technology, the ways banks provide services are becoming increasingly diverse. In addition to the growing popularity of online banking, several banks launched mobile banking vans and video teller machines last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive services than traditional ATMs. As a result of our efforts, several banks are also planning to establish physical branches in remote areas to serve local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial center is a constant effort to stay afloat, and over the years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continuously sought strategic initiatives and explored new areas to foster the growth of Hong Kong’s financial industry. 2016 was a year of considerable success, with financial technology (Fintech) and infrastructure financing as leading developments.\n\nIn the field of financial technology, Hong Kong’s retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. Last year, the HKMA issued 13 licenses for digital payment solutions, creating a favorable business environment for retail payment services through licensing and ongoing regulatory oversight. Alongside a series of public education campaigns, this ensures consumers can enjoy the convenience of new technologies while their rights are reasonably protected.\n\nIn addition, in March last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office as a platform to promote fintech development within the banking sector. Over several months, we launched several initiatives, including the “Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative,” which established a new framework for strengthening bank cybersecurity through risk assessment, information sharing, and talent training. We also partnered with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct dedicated research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its feasibility for application in Hong Kong’s banking sector. This collaboration included establishing a Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to both the banking and fintech industries. The HKMA’s banking supervision department also introduced the “Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,” allowing banks to test new technologies within a smaller, controlled environment, accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks tested 14 new technology projects using the Sandbox, and some of these projects have already been launched in the market, bringing more fintech products to the public.\n\nWorld demand for infrastructure financing is substantial, particularly since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has made it a key focus for both domestic and international attention. Hong Kong, as Asia’s leading international financial center, possesses a distinct advantage in this field. Last July, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) to create a new and unique platform. This platform brings together over 60 world-class multilateral organizations, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, alongside infrastructure project developers, operators, and various professional organizations, to facilitate information exchange, share experiences, and explore collaboration opportunities. Since its establishment, IFFO has hosted more than a dozen large-scale conferences, seminars, and workshops. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure financing. Although operational for a relatively short time, IFFO has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s future as a leading infrastructure financing hub.\n\nTo enhance competitiveness, it’s essential to remove obstacles. This year, the HKMA actively participated in and supported the HKSAR Government’s revision of tax regulations, creating a favorable tax environment for companies conducting corporate treasury activities in Hong Kong. We are also proactively engaging with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their treasury operations here, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong’s financial market.\n\nThe offshore RMB market underwent an adjustment period last year. Affected by market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the global pool of offshore RMB liquidity contracted. Despite this, Hong Kong maintained its dominant position in offshore RMB business, retaining the world’s largest RMB liquidity pool, with RMB transactions settled through Hong Kong averaging approximately 860 billion yuan daily. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong’s offshore RMB market, we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine last October and raised the total bilateral liquidity support quota from 14 billion yuan to 18 billion yuan, ensuring the market’s orderly operation even during periods of liquidity strain. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December further propelled Hong Kong’s RMB business. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also working with mainland authorities to study the Bond Connect scheme, aiming to facilitate greater participation by investors from both regions in the bond market and enhance bond market infrastructure connectivity.\n\nDespite a global investment environment fraught with uncertainty last year, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$68.1 billion, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented over the past period. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund’s annualized compounded investment return has reached 4.8%, exceeding the local inflation rate of 2.1% for the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including expanding asset classes and increasing investments in credit assets, inflation-protected products, and emerging markets. The \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio,\" a key component of this diversification strategy, invests in alternative assets such as private equity and real estate. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has consistently delivered strong performance, with an average annual internal rate of return of approximately 12%. With the allocation of a portion of the government’s “Future Fund,” we have accelerated our investment pace. As of the end of last year, the portfolio’s assets under management were approximately HKD 181.8 billion, with a total of approximately HKD 133.8 billion committed but undrawn for investment. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to its investment strategy of prioritizing capital preservation and long-term growth, seeking stable returns in the long term while maintaining ample liquidity and contingency reserves.\n"}

With increasing uncertainty in the external environment, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Review of the Economy\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were a significant restraint, as weak inbound tourism dampened service exports (Figure 1). Domestic demand also eased, but continued to provide the primary support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained largely stable, with the unemployment rate holding steady at a low of 3.3% to 3.4%. Consumer price inflation further eased as local cost pressures and external price pressures diminished. Facing a volatile external environment and shifting market sentiment, asset markets experienced increased volatility. In response to the resurgence of the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite external volatility and rising U.S. interest rates, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot rate weakened slightly in January and has since hovered around the 7.75 level. The Convertibility Undertaking was not triggered during the year, and the aggregate balance of the Exchange Fund, together with outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds, remained almost unchanged at approximately HKD 1.2 trillion. Following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike in mid-December, the HKMA’s base rate was raised from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) and yields on longer-term bonds remained at relatively low levels, but edged up towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the movements in U.S. equivalent rates. Overall bank lending growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. While overall loan quality deteriorated slightly, specific classified loan ratios remained at very low levels.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution to Real GDP Growth by Components.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Category (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: Seasonally adjusted quarterly changes in total fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Local Needs\n\nLocal demand growth eased slightly in 2016. While stable employment and income continued to support private consumption, its growth rate slowed to 1.6%, partly reflecting increased economic uncertainty. Government consumption growth also eased to 3.3%. Local fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Figure 2), resulting in a 0.5% annual contraction. Private sector purchases of machinery and equipment were the primary factor in this decline, contracting for the third consecutive year amid a weak business outlook, while building and construction activity improved due to increased housing starts.\n\nFigure 2: Local Demand. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# External Needs\n\nHong Kong's exports showed signs of stabilization towards the end of 2016, but the overall annual performance remained weak (Figure 3). Goods exports increased by 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015, as regional trade flows became more stable.\n\nRetail sales growth moderated after a period of rapid expansion, and Hong Kong's service exports declined significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Merchandise imports partially recovered in 2016 following a contraction in 2015, while service imports continued to grow, partly benefiting from increased outbound travel by local residents. The narrowing of the overall trade surplus weighed on local economic growth in 2016.\n\nFigure 3: Merchandise Exports and Service Exports. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation (Trending)\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained in 2016. After excluding the impact of temporary government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate fell from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Figure 4). The decline in private residential rents led to lower rent inflation within the composite consumer price index. Import price inflation was contained thanks to weaker global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar. Meanwhile, local cost pressures remained moderate, supported by stable labor costs and a gradual easing of rental costs, particularly in the retail sector.\n\nFigure 4: Core Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Job Market\n\nThe labor market remained stable in 2016, with balanced supply and demand. Tourism-related sectors experienced a softening of labor market conditions, while other industries remained stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Figure 5). With this stability, nominal wages increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters of the year, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% during that period, compared to a 1.5% increase in 2015.\n\nFigure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong's stock market experienced significant volatility in 2016. Affected by depreciation pressure on the Renminbi and fluctuations in the mainland Chinese stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). In March, the market rebounded, following strong performance in US and other major markets. Despite market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum, sentiment quickly improved as investors anticipated a slowdown in interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and monetary easing policies by other major central banks. The Hang Seng Index reached a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, influenced by the results of the US presidential election and expectations of accelerated interest rate hikes by the US, the market came under pressure again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. Average daily turnover decreased from HKD 105.6 billion the previous year to HKD 66.9 billion, and total capital raised by the Hong Kong stock market also fell from HKD 1,115.6 billion to HKD 490.1 billion.\n\nFigure 6: Asset Prices\nData Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight fluctuations in 2016. Following a historic low in transaction volume during the first quarter, activity rebounded in the subsequent months before declining again with the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, transaction volume decreased marginally to 54,701 units for the year. On the other hand, property prices rose from the second quarter, surpassing the peak reached in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% (Figure 6). Home affordability remained constrained, with a price-to-income ratio of 15.9, exceeding the historical high of 1997. The income leverage ratio stood at 72.0%, significantly above the long-term average. Mortgage rates initially eased due to competitive mortgage plans offered by banks, but subsequently rose towards the end of the year, tracking increases in the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate. In the commercial property market, transaction activity remained broadly stable throughout the year. As prices of non-residential properties retreated from their 2015 highs, corresponding rental yields increased slightly compared to the previous year, although they remained low.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Climate\n\nReal GDP growth in 2017 is expected to remain moderate. The government forecasts economic growth between 2% and 3%, while private sector analysts predict an average increase of 2.0%. Globally, increasing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and financial environment may lead to moderate global economic and trade growth. Furthermore, the Hong Kong dollar’s real effective exchange rate has risen due to the strength of the US dollar, which will weaken Hong Kong's export performance. Domestically, stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, but rising interest rates are likely to moderate private consumption growth. Construction and property activities should grow steadily, benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of several infrastructure projects; however, weak business sentiment and rising interest rates will affect business capital investment.\n\n# The Inflation and the Labor Markets\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2017. Rising global commodity prices and inflation in the Mainland could push up import costs, but a stronger Hong Kong dollar is likely to offset this effect. With moderate economic growth, local cost pressures should remain under control. However, a rise in new residential rents at the beginning of the year may cause a slight increase in the rental component of the consumer price index. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government anticipates an underlying inflation rate of 2.0%. Despite potential uncertainties impacting job creation, private sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Significant Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be shaped by numerous uncertainties, particularly those arising from the external environment. Policy shifts from the new U.S. administration could cloud the global economic outlook, and potential protectionist measures may hinder global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries could also trigger volatility in asset markets and affect Hong Kong dollar flows. Furthermore, the normalization of U.S. interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and put downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market remains tight, and its prospects are highly uncertain. In the short term, however, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and incentives offered by property developers—such as discounts and cash rebates—releasing pent-up purchasing power will support housing demand. Conversely, new stamp duty measures, the possibility of accelerated U.S. interest rate hikes, and a steady increase in housing supply may continue to present challenges to the property market.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nDespite economic headwinds and increased market volatility stemming from unexpected international political developments, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2016. Authorized institutions maintained healthy capital and liquidity positions, and asset quality experienced a minor decline but remained at a sound level.\n\n# Interest Rate Movements\n\nAs U.S. interest rates rose, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) significantly increased in November and December. The composite rate, reflecting the HKD funding costs of retail banks, rose only slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, Composite Rate, and Best Offered Loan Rate\n\nNotes:\n1. The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (monthly average) is published by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\n2. The Prime Lending Rate (monthly average) is based on the rate reported by HSBC Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nRetail banking profitability improved slightly in 2016. Its Hong Kong operations saw an 8.7% increase in pre-tax operating profit, primarily driven by income from foreign exchange and derivatives, dividend income from subsidiaries, and net interest income, which rose by 39.7%, 123.5%, and 2.8% respectively. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in fee and commission income of 11.3%. After-tax profit increased by 44.4%, largely due to non-recurring items. The average return on assets also rose from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Retail Banking Performance\n\nThe net interest margin for retail banking in 2016 was 1.32%, the same as in 2015 (Figure 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate surplus funds to lower-yielding, more liquid financial investments, the decrease in interest income was offset by a decrease in interest costs.\n\nFigure 9: Net Interest Margin for Retail Banking\n\nNon-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, remaining largely stable. Fee income and commission income decreased by 11.3%, while dividend income and income from foreign exchange and derivatives increased by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","en":"# Financial Stability\n\nDespite fluctuations in the external environment and rising U.S. interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable in 2016. The Hong Kong money market also continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity in the interbank sector. The linked exchange rate system continued to demonstrate a high capacity to withstand shocks, serving as the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Aim\n\nHong Kong’s monetary policy primarily aims to maintain a stable currency by ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. This means keeping the exchange rate within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This system operates under a currency board framework, requiring the Exchange Fund to hold US dollar reserves equal to at least 100% of the monetary base. These US dollar reserves are adjusted in direct proportion to any changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Banknote Certificates (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins\n- The total balances of banks’ clearing accounts held with the HKMA (i.e., total balances)\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its commitment to the linked exchange rate system. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen towards the conversion rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing its foreign reserves and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This action brings the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the exchange rate band of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of Hong Kong dollars, causing the market exchange rate to weaken towards the conversion rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, decreasing its foreign reserves and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This restores the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to within the exchange rate band.\n\n# 2016 Retrospective\n\n# Stable Rates\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced slight volatility in the first two months of 2016 before stabilizing within a narrow range for the remainder of the year.  Early in 2016, the Hong Kong dollar weakened noticeably against the US dollar, declining from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Figure 1). This depreciation aligned with the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, reflecting a widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve’s December 2015 interest rate increase.  Contributing factors included selling in the Hong Kong stock market, a less optimistic economic outlook for both mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate, and broader weakness among Asian currencies, all of which dampened demand for the Hong Kong dollar.  Supported by improving market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar briefly strengthened in February and subsequently fluctuated within a narrow band between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onwards, proving resilient even to market disruptions caused by the UK’s Brexit referendum and the US presidential election.  Market expectations of a further US interest rate increase in the summer led to a short period of downward pressure on the Hong Kong dollar in May. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market functioned smoothly throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1: 2016 Market Exchange Rates\n\nThe total surplus and the outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund notes and bonds remained largely unchanged at approximately HKD 12,222 billion in 2016 (Figure 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued HKD 132 billion in foreign exchange fund notes to meet the substantial liquidity management needs of banks, resulting in the total surplus decreasing to HKD 2,596 billion by the end of 2016. This issuance of foreign exchange fund notes is consistent with the principles of the Currency Board System, as it represents a transfer within the monetary base—from the total surplus to outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds—while the monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: Year-End Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds (2016)\n\n# Money Market\n\nHong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Figure 3). It experienced some upward pressure in January and February due to increased financial market volatility, but stabilized in March as conditions eased. Despite market concerns surrounding the Brexit referendum and reforms in U.S. money market funds, HIBOR remained broadly stable during the second and third quarters. A significant increase was recorded in the fourth quarter, partly influenced by year-end funding demand and the Hong Kong dollar rate tracking the rise in U.S. dollar rates. Nevertheless, short-term HIBOR rates were generally below the benchmark rate throughout 2016.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority increased its base rate from 0.75% to 1.00% on December 15, following a U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range increase from 0.25% to 0.50% to 0.50% to 0.75% on December 14 (U.S. time). This adjustment was made in accordance with a revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009, which sets the base rate at the higher of either the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range plus 50 basis points or the 5-day moving average of the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR).\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate in 2016\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rates showed a significant premium in January, largely tracking the spread between Hong Kong dollar and US dollar rates and reflecting investor demand for foreign exchange hedging of their Hong Kong equity portfolios (Figure 4). The premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions stabilized, the rates remained largely stable from March to November, before rising again in December as the HKD-USD rate differential narrowed. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly, with ample liquidity in the banking system. Discount window lending was minimal in 2016, involving only HKD 5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate Regime\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LETS) has remained a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for decades. In early 2016, increased market volatility prompted concerns about a potential weakening of the Hong Kong dollar, reminiscent of the Asian financial crisis. To enhance public understanding of the LETS, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) explained the system’s technical details and emphasized the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system. The government reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining the LETS. Stability in foreign exchange and currency markets further solidified public confidence in the government’s resolve to uphold the LETS and the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payments and a store of value. During its annual Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) explicitly stated that the LETS remains the most suitable monetary regime for Hong Kong, noting that the city’s flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and sound and effective financial regulation underpin the system.\n\nFigure 4: 2016 USD\/HKD Forward Rates\n\nGiven that a sound banking system plays a crucial role in the smooth operation of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. It has strengthened supervision of banks’ lending to individuals, corporations, and Mainland China to ensure the banking system can absorb potential shocks. In light of the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) have begun to rise. The HKMA reminds the public to remain vigilant and prepare for potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, a portion of its assets has been designated to support the monetary base since October 1998. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio was 106.7% as of December 31, 2016 (Figure 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, while certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, the entire asset base of the Exchange Fund is available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources provide a strong buffer for monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong when faced with sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily fluctuations in the support ratio in 2016.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2016, the committee discussed topics including the alignment of economic growth between Hong Kong, mainland China, and the United States, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and Hong Kong’s financial conditions index. Meeting records of the Monetary Policy Committee and reports on the operation of the Monetary Policy Committee, submitted by the HKMA, are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research continues to support research in monetary policy, banking, and finance. In 2016, the Institute hosted 18 scholars and published 20 working papers.\n\nThe research center hosted six international conferences and seminars during the year, including:\n- In January, the 7th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, themed “China’s Growing Impact on the Global Economy.” The conference featured eight research papers covering topics such as China’s economic rebalancing and growth potential, the impact of Chinese economic activity on other nations, the influence of the RMB on global and regional economies, and trends in interest rate arbitrage and information flow within RMB markets.\n- A joint seminar on exchange rates and macroeconomics with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University was held in March, addressing issues such as global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- In August, the Real Estate and Financial Stability Seminar, co-organized with City University of Hong Kong, presented research on topics including the relationship between age, demographics, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; fluctuations in Hong Kong housing prices; housing affordability; the influence of mortgage regulations on homeownership decisions; and the residential property market in mainland China.\n- In October, a seminar on the Asia-Pacific economic system, co-organized with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements, explored “Resilience of Regional Economic Systems in a Volatile Global Environment.” The seminar brought together senior officials from central banks, leading scholars, and experts from international organizations and private institutions for interactive roundtable discussions on key challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region. Discussions included financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, the spillover effects of mainland China’s economic slowdown on neighboring economies, and the outlook for potential growth in the region.\n\nThe Research Center also hosted the 14th Annual Summer Conference in August and the 14th China Mainland Economic Conference in September, addressing asset quality and financial stability concerns at mainland banks. These events attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and central banks worldwide. Throughout the year, the Center further organized 21 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary, and financial matters.\n\n# Currency\n\nAs of the end of 2016, circulating banknotes issued by commercial banks totaled HK$407.8 billion, a 13.2% increase from the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8). Government-issued banknotes and coins reached HK$11.8 billion, a 5.3% increase year-on-year (Figures 9 and 10). Among these government-issued banknotes and coins, HK$10 banknotes accounted for HK$4.4 billion, with polymer banknotes representing 86% of the total.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\n\nDespite increased global market risks and volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained stable in 2016. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened the risk governance frameworks and the effectiveness of credit and liquidity risk management systems within these institutions. Recognizing the growing threat of cyberattacks, the HKMA also enhanced its supervision of technology risk management. To uphold its commitment to combating financial crime, the HKMA continued to prioritize the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. Furthermore, the HKMA took concrete steps to foster a customer-centric culture, promote financial inclusion, and address the challenges faced by overseas small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups in establishing and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also reinforced its oversight of how these institutions sell investment and insurance products, aiming to further protect customers.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in preparing Hong Kong for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards, including the net stable funding ratio, large exposure limits, IFRS 9, and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Regulatory Landscape\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted 188 off-site reviews in 2016, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its communication with the boards of directors of authorized institutions to enhance risk governance and corporate culture within the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with boards or board committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors (INEDs) to exchange views on corporate culture and risk governance. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the compensation systems of authorized institutions contributed to effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy, the HKMA reviews the capital plans of authorized institutions, including their future capital targets, to prepare for the full implementation of Basel III buffer capital in 2019. Solvency stress tests for authorized institutions have also been improved to reflect the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also carefully assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides recommendations for areas where improvements are needed.\n\nThe HKMA continues to conduct thematic assessments alongside regular on-site inspections, focusing these assessments on areas identified as higher risk. This approach allows the HKMA to allocate regulatory resources more effectively to address significant risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic assessments. These inspections and assessments primarily focused on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly risks associated with mainland operations. Another key area of focus was combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity, operational, and technology risk management. During the year, inspection teams also conducted on-site reviews of authorized institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory work in 2016.\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nBank loans grew moderately in 2016. The total outstanding loans increased by 6.5% for the year, compared to an increase of 3.5% in 2015 (Table 2). Customer deposits outpaced bank loan growth, causing the overall loan-to-deposit ratio to decline from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth in Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of related loans on the mainland increased by 7% to HKD 35,640 billion (CNY 35,640 billion) at the end of 2016 (Table 3), including HKD 5,450 billion in loans provided by subsidiaries of banks registered in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained stable in 2016. Although the non-performing loan ratio for retail banking rose slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained significantly below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the non-performing loan ratio for the banking sector as a whole increased from 0.73% to 0.85%. The asset quality of domestic-related loans within the sector mirrored this trend; retail banking’s non-performing loan ratio for these loans also rose slightly, from 0.78% to 0.82%, while the sector’s corresponding ratio increased from 0.77% a year earlier to 0.80%.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has allocated significant regulatory resources to ensure that authorized institutions maintain prudent credit approval standards and effective loan classification and provisioning systems. The HKMA closely monitors the growing exposure of these institutions to risk associated with mainland China’s private enterprises, as well as credit risks arising from investments in debt securities to enhance returns. Furthermore, the HKMA has conducted a targeted assessment of authorized institutions’ credit risk management practices concerning the distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Mortgage Loan\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the mortgage lending activities of licensed banks. Residential property prices began to fluctuate in September 2015, but rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% for the year. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages declined from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical measures, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio for new residential mortgages also declined from 41% in August 2010, when the HKMA first introduced a cap on debt-to-income ratios, to 34% in December 2016 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio for New Residential Property Mortgages.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced repayment-to-income ratio limits before implementing the first round of countercyclical property loan measures.\n\nUnder the seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in February 2015, authorized institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements were required to apply a 15% minimum capital requirement based on credit risk to their entire residential mortgage loan portfolio, previously limited to new mortgage loans. This regulation took effect in June 2016.\n\nMore property developers are offering mortgages directly to property buyers this year, often with loan-to-value ratios exceeding those permitted under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) prudential requirements for authorized institutions. The HKMA is closely monitoring this development and regularly communicates with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage risks associated with property developers. At the HKMA’s request, the Land Registry has agreed to provide an electronic alert service to authorized institutions. When another mortgage document relating to a property they have mortgaged is submitted for registration, the institution will receive an electronic alert from the Land Registry. This service helps prevent borrowers from taking out additional mortgages on the same property without the mortgagee’s prior approval. The Land Registry launched the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nHong Kong, like other international financial centers, faces a growing threat of cyberattacks. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) responded swiftly after receiving reports from licensed institutions of unauthorized stock trading and attempts to breach their payment systems. The HKMA issued a public advisory urging caution against online stock trading scams and recommending preventative measures. It also provided guidance to licensed institutions on strengthening the security of their online banking services. Regarding attempts to compromise bank payment systems, the HKMA had previously alerted institutions to be vigilant against such fraud, explaining the methods used by criminals with police assistance. The HKMA also emphasized the need for institutions to incorporate these methods into their enhanced payment monitoring procedures.\n\nTo further enhance the banking system’s ability to respond to cyber risks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Cyber Defence Programme in May 2016. This programme comprises three key components: a Cyber Defence Assessment Framework, a Professional Training Programme, and a Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform. Further details can be found in the “Financial Technology Promotion Office” section of the chapter “Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre.” In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a notice to authorized institutions outlining the implementation timeline for the Cyber Defence Assessment Framework.\n\nFinancial technology saw significant advancements in the banking sector in 2016, with multiple authorized institutions launching new fintech products. Key developments included personal small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication. In September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced a regulatory testing environment, known as the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox,\" allowing authorized institutions to test their fintech initiatives in a controlled setting without fully complying with HKMA regulations. This arrangement enables institutions to gather real-world data and user feedback before officially launching new services, allowing for necessary adjustments. By the end of 2016, six applications to participate in the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox had been approved, covering biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain technology for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also raised the transaction limit for online banking personal small-value payment services that do not require dual authentication to HKD 5,000 per account per day, to meet the growing demand for convenient personal payment options.\n\nIn 2016, several property-related fraud cases occurred, involving fraudsters impersonating property owners to obtain benefits through mortgage loan applications or property sales. Although these cases did not involve authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely collaborated with the police and the Hong Kong Banking Association to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing such fraud within the banking sector. Throughout the year, the HKMA published two issues of the Incident Report, sharing lessons learned from operational incidents experienced by authorized institutions. The HKMA also conducted on-site reviews and thematic assessments of authorized institutions’ business operational risk management systems, fraud management practices, trust and custodial services, and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent unauthorized transactions.\n\n# Regulation of Financial Assets and Operations and Liquidity Risk\n\nIn 2016, several major political events triggered significant fluctuations in financial markets throughout the year. Simultaneously, U.S. interest rates continued their gradual normalization, and in December, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate for the second time since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these events, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintained close contact with overseas regulators, assessing the impact on the Hong Kong banking system and urging banks to remain vigilant and bolster their risk management practices.\n\nIn managing liquidity risk, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducts additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system’s ability to withstand severe stress scenarios and follows up with authorized institutions to enhance their capacity. Following a round of on-site reviews on interest rate risk management in 2015, the HKMA has also conducted further reviews to evaluate the market risk management of authorized institutions, requiring those with inadequate monitoring to implement corrective actions.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s risk-based supervision for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing includes both on-site and off-site assessments, including regulatory contact with licensed firms regarding specific matters. These assessments primarily target areas with heightened risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. They evaluate licensed firms’ risk assessments, the implementation of risk-based practices, and the systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, the Authority’s specialized supervisory staff conducted 17 on-site assessments and 30 off-site assessments.\n\nThe HKMA prioritizes addressing challenges faced by certain industries and individuals when opening bank accounts. It has also issued guidance and FAQs to clarify customer due diligence requirements and its supervisory expectations regarding risk management. Simultaneously, the HKMA continues to collaborate closely with industry associations to provide guidance for authorized institutions in managing risks, such as those related to trade-based money laundering.\n"}

Last year’s tax revisions helped create a favorable environment for attracting multinational corporations to establish treasury centers in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing center and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Support Office and the Fintech Support Office within the year. The HKMA also issued 13 licenses to stored value payment tool issuers during the year. Hong Kong’s sound fiscal performance and substantial net external assets continue to be affirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nAffected by fluctuations in global financial markets and uncertainty surrounding the RMB exchange rate, global offshore RMB business slowed in 2016. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as the world’s leading hub for offshore RMB transactions, processing approximately 70% of global RMB payment flows. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect mechanism in December marked another milestone in the mainland’s capital account opening and represents a significant step in solidifying Hong Kong’s role as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding RMB liquidity support and implementing measures to enhance market transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development and position Hong Kong as a leading center for infrastructure financing. By bringing together key stakeholders, IFFO aims to foster growth in this sector. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully secured legislative amendments to address tax imbalances and provide incentives, encouraging multinational and mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, thereby generating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services industries. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong has also steadily increased; notably, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world’s third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong—its sole location outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a positive evaluation of our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial center during last year's fourth Article IV consultation. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participated in international discussions, striving to promote global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, and these efforts helped secure the confirmation of Hong Kong’s credit ratings by major credit rating agencies in 2016.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure's safe and effective operation and sustained development are essential to strengthening its competitiveness as an international financial center and a global offshore RMB business hub. In 2016, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems for interbank transactions and the central clearing system for debt instruments (CMU system) achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nIn 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority further strengthened Hong Kong's retail payment financial infrastructure. During the year, a total of 13 payment tool licenses were issued under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, which took effect in November 2016. The scope of electronic cheque services was also expanded to include cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of fintech in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. Several key measures implemented throughout the year have made significant progress.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced a series of measures to strengthen the professional standing of the banking industry, including (i) launching a program to enhance the professional competence of directors; (ii) establishing a professional qualifications framework for banking practitioners across the industry; and (iii) implementing a consumer education program.\n\n# 2016 Recap\n\n# Offshore RMB Services\n\nHong Kong’s offshore Renminbi business slowed in 2016 due to volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty surrounding the Renminbi exchange rate. By year-end, the combined balance of Renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit in Hong Kong totaled RMB 625.1 billion, a 38% decrease from the previous year (Figure 1). Offshore Renminbi bond issuance fell to RMB 52.8 billion during the year, and the value of Renminbi trade settlements processed by Hong Kong banks also decreased to RMB 45,421 billion. Hong Kong banks held RMB 294.8 billion in Renminbi loans at year-end, roughly unchanged from the previous year (Figure 2). The Renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system maintained high transaction volumes, processing an average of RMB 8,636 billion daily in 2016. This demonstrates that despite a reduction in the Renminbi funding pool, Hong Kong continues to support significant Renminbi financial activity. According to SWIFT statistics, Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of global Renminbi payment transactions in 2016, confirming its position as a leading hub for offshore Renminbi business.\n\nFigure 1: RMB Customer Deposits and Certificates of Deposit\n\nFigure 2: Renminbi Financing Activities\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) worked closely with mainland authorities throughout the year to secure greater policy space and promote RMB businesses in Hong Kong. Several new measures were introduced, including further opening up the mainland interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, and the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December. To meet the increasing demand for cross-border investment channels and liquidity management, the HKMA expanded its RMB liquidity arrangements. In October, the number of primary liquidity providers under the arrangements was increased from seven to nine, and the total quota was raised from 14 billion RMB to 18 billion RMB. The HKMA also enhanced the transparency of these arrangements, helping participating banks more effectively manage their liquidity.\n\nThe Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, announced in March, reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a global RMB hub, demonstrating the central government’s support for expanding Hong Kong’s RMB business.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore RMB business. The HKMA also actively participates in various events to promote Hong Kong as a global offshore RMB business hub and a key platform for the Mainland’s going global strategy, including local events organized by industry groups and private institutions, as well as overseas activities in the Mainland, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Agreement on Closer Economic and Trade Relations between Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\nUnder the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between Hong Kong and the Mainland, a new agreement to further liberalize trade in services was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of existing measures and collaborates with government authorities to explore expanding access to the Mainland market for Hong Kong’s financial sector.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Facilitating Office (IFFO)\n\n# IFFO Mission\n\nIFFO’s mission is to foster infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions include:\n- Providing a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;\n- Enhancing skills and knowledge in infrastructure finance;\n- Promoting market and product development; and\n- Facilitating infrastructure projects.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue (seventh from the left) toasted with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July, with a mission to promote infrastructure investment and financing by facilitating collaboration among key stakeholders. As of January 31, 2017, more than 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project developers and operators, professional service firms, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made significant progress since its establishment. To enhance professional capabilities, IFFO co-hosted an executive workshop in October with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, and Hanwha Investment & Securities, focusing on “Private Capital Participation in Infrastructure Financing Projects in Emerging Markets.” The workshop received very positive feedback from participants, contributing to knowledge enhancement and expanding professional networks. In November, IFFO also held a high-level seminar, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to deliver a speech and share his experience in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Center to establish a framework for cooperation. Subsequently, in December, IFFO signed MoUs with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China to promote infrastructure financing for these banks through the IFFO platform. These activities have strengthened Hong Kong's position and international reputation as a leading infrastructure financing center.\n\nChan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Philippe Le Houérou, Executive Vice President and CEO of the International Finance Corporation, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to foster collaboration in leveraging the IFFO platform to create a more efficient and conducive market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue (left) and Global Infrastructure Hub Chief Executive Officer Chris Heathcote (right) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework to facilitate infrastructure project financing.\n\nMr. Chen Der-lin, former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), and Mr. Hu Huai-bang, Chairman of the China Development Bank, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen cooperation between the two institutions.\n\n# Corporate Treasury Center\n\nTo further attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the government are collaborating to create a favorable tax environment. Specifically, the Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (the “Amendment Ordinance”), passed in June, allows companies meeting specified conditions to deduct interest expenses related to internal financing within their group when calculating profits tax. Furthermore, profits from designated treasury activities of eligible corporate treasury centers are subject to a 50% reduction in profits tax, effectively lowering the rate to 8.25%. Table 2 summarizes key points of the Amendment Ordinance.\n\nBy the end of the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had actively promoted the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong to multinational and mainland Chinese enterprises. The HKMA had engaged with nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organizations. In November, the HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to help Chinese-funded enterprises in Hong Kong better understand and utilize the corporate treasury center platform.\n\n# Promote asset management services.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority remains committed to promoting Hong Kong as a leading asset management center. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management reached 1,300 by the end of 2016, an annual increase of nearly 15%. The Asian Private Equity Journal reported that the number of private equity firms in Hong Kong (including both SFC-licensed and non-SFC-licensed firms) also increased by 4.6% to 431 in 2016. Currently, nearly 70 of the world’s top 100 asset management companies, as well as most of mainland China’s top 20 mutual fund companies, have established a presence in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong is also growing. Notably, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong—its sole office outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introducing an Open-Ended Fund Company Structure\n\nTo attract fund registrations to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to collaborate with the government and industry to foster a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016 was passed, introducing an open-ended fund company structure, which diversifies Hong Kong’s fund registration platform and provides fund managers with a more flexible operating environment, thereby strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international asset management center.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to raising market awareness and understanding of Islamic finance. This includes collaborating with industry associations to host and participate in seminars and lectures, and sharing its experience in issuing Islamic bonds to encourage market participants to use Hong Kong as a platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two batches of Islamic bonds, the HKMA continues to work closely with the government to launch a third batch when market conditions are suitable.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2016年）\n\n1. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。\n2. 綜合消費物價指數以2014\/2015年為基期的數列計算。\n\n表2 外匯基金投資回報率：以港元計\n\n1. 2001至2003年的投資回報率以美元計。2. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。3. 不同年期的平均數以複合年度方式計算。\n\n表3 外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重（包括遠期交易）\n","en":"# Inventory and Reserve Management\n\n2016 was a year marked by unexpected events and market volatility, with global financial markets experiencing significant fluctuations. Early in the year, concerns over an economic slowdown in China and a broader global growth deceleration led to a sharp decline in global stock markets. The outcomes of the UK’s Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November also proved surprising. Despite the challenging investment climate, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority had implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to strengthen the resilience of the Exchange Fund, allowing it to achieve an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, and also to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. The Financial Secretary controls the Exchange Fund and invests it in securities or other assets deemed appropriate after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Management\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) Preserving capital;\n(b) Ensuring that the overall monetary base is adequately supported at all times by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(c) Ensuring sufficient liquidity is maintained to support monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Seeking investment returns to the extent possible, consistent with the above objectives (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is structured into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, ensuring a stable monetary base in line with established currency regulations. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bond and equity markets within OECD member countries to maintain asset value and long-term purchasing power. The portfolios’ long-term target allocation is 71% bonds and 29% equities. Approximately 91% of assets are allocated to U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% invested in other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is prudently diversifying a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are managed within the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are allocated to the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus, but this cap can be increased as future fund allocations are directed toward long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its distinct characteristics, its performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund periodically accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally tied to the performance of its investment portfolio. However, this does not apply to Future Fund deposits, whose interest rates are linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and a long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate determined by their respective weighting. As of the end of 2016, the Future Fund’s allocation was split 80:20 between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflecting the investment benchmark, defines the optimal long-term asset allocation for the Fund to achieve its investment objectives. Guided by this strategic allocation, the Fund implements tactical asset allocation to seek returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, actual allocation may deviate from the benchmark, and this difference is known as “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and the limits for tactical deviation; the Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation. Portfolio managers can hold positions within these limits to profit from short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investments\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Reserve Management Department directly manages approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire support portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion invests in global fixed-income markets and manages the Exchange Fund’s macro risk strategies using derivatives.\n\n# Outsourced Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also engages external investment managers to oversee approximately 26% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. This arrangement allows the Exchange Fund to benefit from diverse investment strategies and access top-tier investment expertise, while also providing internal professionals with valuable market insights.\n\nThe expenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary annually and are primarily influenced by market factors.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the Securities and Futures Commission’s publication of the “Principles of Responsible Ownership” (“the Principles”) on March 7, 2016. These voluntary principles aim to guide investors in exercising their ownership responsibilities in Hong Kong-listed companies. When managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers responsible for Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles.\n\n# Risk Management and Monitoring\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, highlighting the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict risk management measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. It also employs risk management tools to assess market risks under both normal and severely adverse market conditions. The HKMA conducts detailed analyses of investment performance factors to effectively leverage the expertise of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# 2016 Financial Markets\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced significant fluctuations. In January, concerns about a hard landing in the Chinese economy and slowing global growth led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, which stabilized by mid-February. The unexpected outcomes of the UK’s Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November caused brief market downturns, but stock markets quickly recovered. Overall, global stock markets performed well throughout the year.\n\nIn the bond market, declining commodity prices in the first quarter deepened concerns about slowing global growth and low inflation. Coupled with uncertainty surrounding the UK’s Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations of central banks’ accommodative policies, demand for safe-haven assets increased, supporting strong performance in government bond markets during the first half of 2016. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, rising market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, particularly after the U.S. presidential election, caused U.S. Treasury yields to spike. Yields on other major government bond markets also rose, but to a lesser extent.\n\nThe U.S. dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the dollar index reaching a 14-year high. This strength was supported by widening interest rate differentials between the dollar and other major currencies. The Japanese yen rose about 3% against the dollar in 2016, while the euro fell by approximately 3%. Following the Brexit referendum, the British pound also declined 16% against the dollar during the year, its largest drop since 2008.\n\nTable 1 presents the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1: 2016 Market Returns\nStock market performance is calculated based on the change in index prices during the year.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant volatility in the financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 68.1 billion in 2016, including HKD 28.6 billion from overseas equities, HKD 5.3 billion from Hong Kong equities, HKD 33.1 billion from bonds, and HKD 16.9 billion from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. This income was partially offset by a HKD 15.8 billion foreign exchange valuation loss on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, resulting from the sharp appreciation of the US dollar last year, which led to valuation adjustments when those investments were converted back into Hong Kong dollars. Separately, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 3.6187 trillion. The market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolio totaled HKD 181.8 billion, including HKD 116.8 billion in private equity and HKD 65 billion in real estate. A total of HKD 133.8 billion had been committed but not yet drawn down.\n\nThe Exchange Fund achieved an investment return of 2% in 2016 (excluding strategic asset portfolio). The long-term growth portfolio has generated an annualized internal rate of return of approximately 12% since 2009.\n\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a series of defensive measures in recent years, including shortening the duration of the bond portfolio, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing assets denominated in non-US dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar currencies. We have also accelerated our investment diversification, particularly in our long-term growth portfolio. These measures have significantly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Foreign Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 displays the Fund’s investment returns in 2016 and average returns over different periods. The Fund’s average returns were 0.9% over the past three years, 2.0% over the past five years, 2.6% over the past ten years, and 4.8% since 1994.

As part of the Hong Kong government, the HKMA recruits staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with relevant experience and specialized skills. Committed to maintaining a streamlined organizational structure, the HKMA seeks to implement new initiatives and manage increasing workloads by adjusting its staffing resources.\n\n# Staff Planning\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had a staffing level of 875 at the beginning of 2016. Twelve positions were added in the second half of 2016 to fulfill the HKMA’s regulatory responsibilities under the new insurance regulatory regime. Consequently, the HKMA’s staffing level was 887 by the end of 2016.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s overall staffing increased by 40 to 927 in 2017, a 4.5% rise, to ensure sufficient resources for implementing new legislation and policies, continuing ongoing pilot programs, and managing its expanding workload. These additional positions support the following functions:\n-   Promoting the stability of the banking and financial system, including:\n    -   Bolstering oversight to manage growing technological risks in banks and new fintech initiatives, as well as addressing banks’ regional and business expansion;\n    -   Strengthening regulatory and law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and preparing for the 2018 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation;\n    -   Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance to address “too big to fail” issues in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and\n    -   Improving supervision to align with new international standards on capital and market risk, and allocating additional resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.\n-   Enhancing investment, risk management, and related support in response to increased investment activities related to diversifying the Exchange Fund’s investment products, while reinforcing strategic asset allocation and investment procedures to navigate increasingly challenging investment environments.\n-   Developing and implementing talent development programs and bolstering related resources to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to address market developments and future challenges.\n-   Strengthening research on monetary policy and processing monetary statistics, as well as allocating resources to handle inquiries and complaints regarding the licensing, designation, and related regulatory matters of stored-value payment instruments and retail payment systems.\n\nTable 1 lists the approved positions and actual number of staff at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) by department.\nTable 1: Approved Positions and Actual Staff Numbers as of January 1, 2017.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates temporary resources to handle other tasks and seconds staff to international or local organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Development Council, to assist with work or policies related to Hong Kong or the HKMA. In addition, the HKMA seconds staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Committee and the Financial Services & Treasury Bureau to provide full-time or operational support.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the salaries and service conditions for Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees by consulting with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and considering market salary levels and practices. The compensation package includes cash compensation and contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), along with other basic benefits. Cash compensation consists of a fixed monthly salary (basic salary) and an annual variable payment based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary annually reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff. This review incorporates recommendations from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which in turn considers the governance committee’s evaluation of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, compensation surveys conducted by independent consulting firms in the financial sector, and other relevant factors. Salaries for individual employees demonstrating exceptional performance may be adjusted to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed salaries or awarding performance-based bonuses based on individual employee performance. For professional investment personnel, the bonus system is designed to align compensation with investment performance. Adjustments to fixed salaries or the awarding of bonuses for Assistant General Managers and above require approval from the Financial Secretary, after considering the views of the governing committee; these employees will recuse themselves from discussions regarding their own compensation. For employees at the General Manager level and below, these adjustments or bonuses are determined by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, based on the Financial Secretary’s delegated authority, and in accordance with the total approved amount allocated for salary payments.\n\n# Compensation for Top Executives\n\nTable 2 lists the compensation information for senior personnel in 2016.\n\nIn addition to accrued annual leave, the actual salary of employees with less than one year of service will be calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual salary for their position grade. The number of employees listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","en":"# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Financial Audit and Review Bureau\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report for the Financial Secretary\n\n# Suggestions\n\nWe hereby certify that we have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") set out on pages 149 to 237, which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2016, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nThe financial statements fairly present the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Foundation of Opinions\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities regarding the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of this report. In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Significant Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, were most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I addressed these matters in forming my opinion on the overall financial statements and will not provide a separate opinion on them.\n\n# Auditor General's Report (Continued)\n\n# Significant Audit Matters\n\nHow should I deal with related issues during an audit?\n\n# Financial assets and financial liabilities recognized at fair value.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group’s financial assets valued at fair value totaled HK$31,989.75 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$9,639.77 billion.\n\n95% of these financial assets and all financial liabilities have a fair value that is either a quoted price in an active market (Level 1 inputs) or is estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets total HKD 1,758.86 billion, primarily including unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related controls;\n- Evaluating and testing these controls, including application controls within computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights, obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when using market quotations;\n- If the valuation method’s parameters are based on observable market data, evaluating the method’s appropriateness and the reasonableness of the related assumptions, and verifying the parameters against independent sources; and\n- If the valuation method’s parameters are not based on observable market data, evaluating the method’s appropriateness and the reasonableness of the related assumptions and parameters.\n\n# Future Fund Savings\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28 of the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, the majority of deposits in the fiscal reserve were repayable on request and earned interest at a fixed rate based on the previous year’s investment returns.\n\nThe government established the Future Fund within its fiscal reserves on January 1, 2016. The fund received an initial investment of HKD 219.73 billion from the Land Fund surplus, and will receive ongoing contributions from the government’s general revenue account, the amount of which is determined by the Financial Secretary. Interest on the Future Fund’s deposits is calculated annually using a weighted average of two rates: a fixed rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and an annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio, which includes private equity and real estate investments. Unless the Financial Secretary directs otherwise, the fund’s deposits, along with any interest earned, will be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Future Fund held deposits totaling HKD 2,245.30 billion. The accumulated interest income on these deposits amounted to HKD 100.71 billion. Due to the substantial amounts involved and significant changes in deposit terms, this warrants careful attention to the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of these deposits and the related interest income.\n\nRegarding future fund deposits, the audit procedures include:\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used to measure the deposits and related interest.\n- Reviewing the calculation method for the annual return rate linked to the long-term growth portfolio.\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed interest rate, the annual return rate linked to the long-term growth portfolio, and the composite interest rate based on these rates, all determined by reference to the reference portfolio’s historical performance.\n- Verifying the amount of accrued interest calculated using the composite interest rate.\n- Reviewing the reporting of the deposits and related interest in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Property Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 17, and 18 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value, totaling HKD 22.723 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in three associate companies and fourteen jointly controlled entities, whose primary business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with these interests valued at a total of HKD 320.83 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or through associate companies or jointly controlled entities, are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgment and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\n- Confirming that the fair value is determined based on the valuations in relevant reports obtained and reviewed for investment properties held directly by the Group or held by joint ventures or associates, and assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Assessing the suitability of the valuation methods and whether the assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Materials\n\nFinancial Services Officers are responsible for other information. This includes all information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2016 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion applies only to the financial statements and does not provide assurance on any other matters.\n\nRegarding the audit of the financial statements, I am responsible for reviewing other information to assess whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or raises concerns about potential material misstatements. If, based on my work, I identify such concerns, I am required to report them. I have found no such issues.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Services Bureau and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nFinancial Management Officers are responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in compliance with instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. They must also implement internal controls as necessary to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial specialists are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern and disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The Auditor’s Responsibility for Financial Statement Audits\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements. Material misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to those risks; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence upon which to base my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by management and the reasonableness of their accounting estimates and related disclosures;\n- Determine whether management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there are material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that material uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements. If the related disclosures are inadequate, I will issue a qualified audit report. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the auditor’s report date. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and matters; and\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline, as well as significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.\n"}
