{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n","zh":"# 行政長官致詞\n\n2021年是鞏固與發展並進的一年。\n\n2021年，疫情持續未退，全球供應鏈受阻，通膨壓力日增，全球金融條件過早收緊的風險亦隨之增加。此外，新冠病毒變異株的出現以及地緣政治局勢的升溫，更為此增添了變數。儘管如此，我們持續維護貨幣與金融穩定，並保持營運韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來了復甦的希望，這得益於新冠疫苗的順利接種，以及多個經濟體實施的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟開始從2020年的嚴重收縮中恢復。本地方面，香港經濟在經歷了2019年及2020年的經濟下滑後，於2021年實現了6.3%的增長，這主要歸功於疫苗接種工作的推動，以及政府推出的紓困措施，為香港經濟的復甦提供了關鍵支持。\n\n在金融與貨幣保持穩定，宏觀經濟環境亦趨於平穩的基礎上，2021年為我們提供了推進更多發展工作的機會。我們把握先機，積極推動一系列發展計劃，以協助我們的金融業保持高度競爭力。憑藉香港的獨特優勢，我們在金融科技、綠色金融以及內地市場三大戰略重點領域取得了顯著成果。\n\n踏入2022年，全球局勢面臨諸多挑戰。但正如常言道，逆境中更顯決心。我們將繼續積極應對，致力實現發展目標和優先事項，為應對未來挑戰做好充分準備，並鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅守承諾，確保香港的貨幣及金融體系穩健可靠，正如我們過去屢屢克服各種挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自一九八三年創立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港金融體系的關鍵支撐，有助於香港應對無數的衝擊與挑戰。儘管新型冠狀病毒疫情持續帶來不確定性，且市場對美國貨幣政策收緊速度的擔憂猶存，香港港元匯率及貨幣市場全年均保持有序運作，充分體現了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n對我們體系的信心並非一步驟完成，而是建立在多年來穩固的基礎之上。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年的外部部門報告中再次強調，LERS的可信度已得到保障，這得益於一套透明的規則、充足的財政與外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體制以及謹慎的財政框架。\n\n這種信心也源於我們在公眾及市場的溝通與參與，以及有效的監測體系。尤其在監測方面，我們已運用科技與數據分析，提升了金融穩定及宏觀審慎監測的及時性和全面性。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。經歷兩年的新冠疫情，本地銀行流動性狀況及資本充足率均表現出色，符合國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足率為20.2%，遠超最低要求8%；大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋率則在2021年第四季達到151.9%，亦高於法定最低要求100%。儘管疫情期間信貸環境面臨挑戰，銀行業的資產質素在當年大致維持穩定。截至2021年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略為下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的穩固支柱\n\n銀行業一向是支持經濟活動的重要支柱。尤其在面對新冠疫情對經濟造成的衝擊時，此點更顯關鍵。 過去一年，主要挑戰在於如何在銀行業管理信貸風險的同時，持續支持實體經濟。 憑藉多年來的監管工作，各銀行有效管理信貸風險。 同時，我們亦與銀行密切合作，透過「預先批准本金還款暫緩計劃」（PPPHS）及其他配套措施，為企業及個人客戶提供所需的支持。 PPPHS於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制同步推出，允許符合資格的企業客戶在預先批准的前提下，延遲貸款本金償還六個月。 鑑於部分經濟行業持續受到疫情影響，為減輕其壓力，PPPHS於2021年兩度延長，至2022年4月。 隨後，為應對本地新冠病毒感染個案再度上升，PPPHS再延至2022年10月底。 令人欣慰的是，銀行業與香港金融管理局攜手合作，協助企業及個人借款人減輕現金流壓力，即使該行自身亦正面臨疫情帶來的經營挑戰。\n\n除了挑戰性的信貸環境，疫情也帶來了更具挑戰性的營運環境，以及日益嚴峻的網絡安全威脅。我們已加強努力，提升銀行業的營運及網絡韌性，並在數位化加速發展的同時，強化消費者與投資者保護，尤其針對日益猖獗的釣魚詐騙。為此，我們已修訂《銀行業行為準則》，以加強對數位金融服務中消費者保護。\n\n除了監管工作外，我們致力於推動銀行業的金融包容性及以客戶為中心的文化。提升有需要客戶獲得銀行服務的可及性一直是我們的重點領域，我們亦一直與業界密切合作，制定行業指引。繼無障礙銀行服務指引及為認知障礙症患者提供銀行服務的指引後，業界在金管局的支持下，於2021年12月發表了一項指引，旨在闡述銀行業為認知障礙症患者及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則及良好實務。\n\n為支持銀行業未來持續發展，面對瞬息萬變的增長機遇與挑戰，香港金融管理局已制定一項全面的人才發展策略——「連結人才，邁向未來」，旨在更系統、更有針對性地培養未來人才，並提升現有專業人員的技能。 我們的全新策略以三大「連結」方向為基礎：連結學生與銀行業、連結從業員與銀行業的未來，以及連結各關鍵持份者，以加強策略實施的協作。 我們已推出一系列推廣活動，吸引更多學生投身銀行業。為更好地為大學生做好迎接未來挑戰的準備，我們與香港銀行學會合辦「未來銀行橋樑計劃」，該計劃涵蓋實用銀行知識及銀行業高度需求的軟技能課程。針對現有銀行專業人員，我們與業界緊密合作，提供更多市場緊缺的培訓課程，以提升其專業能力。二零二一年十二月，在「加強銀行業從業員能力發展框架」下，全新金融科技模組正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與各界持份者攜手合作，推動行業進一步發展，以強化人才儲備。\n\n# 國際金融中心：得益於無與倫比的發展機會，地位堅實。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，源於其獨有的優勢，為各方提供暢通的機會。普遍認為，全球金融科技的普及、中國內地金融市場的開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的興起，都為香港金融業的未來發展帶來了巨大的機遇。香港金管局一直致力於利用香港的獨特優勢，把握這些機遇。現在，容我先談談金融科技和中國內地市場的機會。\n\n# 廣泛採用金融科技\n\n疫情清楚地展現了金融科技的強大實力，並永久性地改變了消費者對金融服務的行為模式。為確保我們能持續領先全球金融科技領域，並充分挖掘金融科技的全部潛力，我們必須構建一個生態系統，讓金融科技的價值在各個層面和所有人群中都能得到體驗。\n\n這項願景驅使我們制定「金融科技2025」策略，並於2021年6月正式發布。正如其名所示，此策略旨在協助金融業在2025年前全面應用科技。策略包含五個重點領域，涵蓋建立成功的生態系統所需要素，以及促進生態系統持續發展的關鍵因素。策略首要目標是推動各銀行積極採用金融科技，以及為香港的央行數位貨幣（CBDC）做好準備，藉此激發更多金融科技應用需求。策略的其他面向則著重於數據、基礎設施、人才和資金，這些都是生態系統蓬勃發展不可或缺的要素。\n\n根據此策略，我們推出了一系列新措施，例如粵港澳大灣區（GBA）金融科技沙盒，讓金融機構和科技公司得以進行跨境金融科技項目的先導試驗，並從監管機構和用戶處獲得早期回饋；同時，我們亦啟動了商業數據交換的試點，利用替代數據促進中小企業融資。此外，我們正加強研究批發型央行數字貨幣（wholesale CBDC）在跨境支付中的應用，並積極探討電子港元（e-HKD）的前景，為香港在採用央行數字貨幣方面奠定基礎，並提升本港金融基礎設施在未來數十年的應變能力。\n\n在把握科技進步帶來的新機遇的同時，我們亦會持續鞏固現有的成就，並留意潛在的新風險。例如，於2018年推出的快速支付系統（FPS），近年來發展迅速，截至2021年底，註冊用戶數已達960萬，較去年增長40%。2021年的平均每日交易額亦較2020年上升90%，達到約673,000萬筆即時交易。為應對加密資產，特別是與支付相關的穩定幣的快速發展，我們今年初已發布討論文件，以徵求市場對制定適當監管框架的意見。\n\n我們全新的、前瞻性的策略將為金融科技生態系統營造健康的發展環境。隨著銀行業積極利用金融科技以拓展商機，這最終將有益於金融機構及香港市民，同時強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為連接中國內地的關鍵樞紐\n\n香港一向在連接內地市場與國際金融市場中扮演重要角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的監管環境及平台，從事各類金融、投資及資產管理業務。國家「十四五」規劃進一步鞏固了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。 配合全球經濟發展趨勢，我們深信香港應持續發揮其獨特價值， 作為連接內地與國際市場的關鍵樞紐。\n\n於二零二一年，我們在提升連通性方面取得重要進展，為我們的「連通」安排新增了兩項成員，分別是粵港澳大灣區的跨境理財通（Cross-boundary WMC）及債券通下的南向交易，基本上完成了股票、債券及財富管理等多個金融市場的雙向互通。 兩項安排的推出將為香港帶來各方面的全新機遇。透過滿足內地投資者日益增長的多元化需求，兩項安排將擴大我們債券市場及財富管理行業的客戶群。我很高興看到理財通及債券通運作順利。香港金融管理局將繼續與內地當局溝通合作，逐步完善這些安排。\n"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n","zh":"# 二零二二年及未來之關鍵\n\n進入2022年，全球及本地經濟環境均出現明顯轉差。一方面，烏克蘭局勢持續緊張，加上美國聯邦儲備局加息預期，市場波動加劇；另一方面，本地經濟受到新一波新冠疫情的影響。然而，得益於多年來累積的穩健性和充足的儲備，香港金融體系具備應對不利因素的能力。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定，並積極應對潛在風險。為達此目的，我們將密切監察市場動態，並在必要時採取靈活應對措施。同時，香港金融管理局亦會積極尋找機會，鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的核心地位。在管理外匯基金的過程中，香港金融管理局將持續謹慎投資，保持靈活性，並確保充足的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩健及信賴性\n\n全球經濟前景仍然存在重大不確定性。香港金融管理局將密切關注最新發展，並保持警惕，以應對潛在風險，維護金融體系的韌性和穩定，確保持續提供關鍵金融服務，支持香港經濟運作。\n\n# 留意潛在風險，未雨綢繆\n\n展望未來，市場可能因多重不確定因素而波動加劇。一方面，若美國聯邦儲備局持續以較快速度調整貨幣政策，或將導致全球金融環境收緊，並增加各國的債務償付壓力。另一方面，自2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級以來，地緣政治風險，包括中美關係的緊張，持續存在，可能再次引發金融市場波動。此外，疫情持續演變，若大規模封鎖措施再度實施，可能導致全球供應鏈持續受阻，進而影響全球經濟增長和通脹。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉多年來所累積的韌性與穩健的財務基礎，足以應對不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦具備充足的能力、資源及堅定的承諾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續密切監察本地及外部環境的風險和脆弱性，並隨時準備採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。二零二二年研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛在風險。為加強對金融體系的監察，金管局正持續推行數碼化計劃，藉此提升監測能力，從而實現更全面的監察。\n\n# 維持銀行體系穩定\n\n隨著發達市場收緊貨幣政策，並在疫情持續影響下，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預計將持續嚴峻。然而，快速的科技進步和數位轉型也為銀行業帶來了機遇，同時也帶來挑戰。面對不斷變化的金融環境，香港金融管理局致力於透過持續的監察工作，確保銀行體系具備應對衝擊的能力。 另一方面，金管局亦將持續優化銀行監管及政策框架，並參考國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n# 以風險為中心的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n二零二二年，香港金融管理局將加強監察銀行信貸風險敞口，並採取主動措施，確保整體風險水平維持在可控範圍內。\n\n香港金融管理局亦會繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業營運情況的影響，並與銀行業和商業界保持密切溝通，同時審視各項紓困措施。\n\n# 運作及科技風險\n\n隨著2022年5月新版《監管政策手冊》（SPM）「業務韌性」模組的發布，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將持續與業界溝通，了解獲授權機構（AIs）在建立業務韌性架構方面的進展。同時，金管局將跟進AIs在《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》評估中揭示的問題，並監察其實施安全的三級數據備份。另一個重點監管範疇，是評估及應對獲授權機構日益依賴科技服務供應商所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉疫情期間提升的數位能力和累積的豐富遠程工作經驗，部分人工智能機構正計劃在恢復常態運作的基礎上轉向混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將密切關注此發展，並評估業界是否已充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n香港金融管理局將於二零二二年專注於監察授權機構的流動性及市場風險管理。 尤其，香港金融管理局將繼續監測授權機構在二零二三年六月三十日前，轉離剩餘的倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）設定的進展，以應對這些設定屆時停止發布。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義資金來源\n\n在2022年，香港金融管理局（金管局）在反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）的工作將繼續重點加強透過合作及資訊共享，提升對欺詐及金融犯罪的應對能力，並積極與反洗錢\/打恐生態系統中的各方加強合作。其他重點包括，利用更強大的數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，實施更廣泛的風險敏感型監管技術，以及推廣銀行應用監管科技（Regtech），例如交易監控系統。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續與政府、銀行界及儲值支付工具 (SVF) 業界緊密合作，公佈更新的香港洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估報告，並協助業界應對新興及不斷變化的風險。同時，我們亦會持續研究洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險的演變趨勢，並落實修改《洗錢及反恐融資條例》及相關指引，以符合國際標準。此外，香港金融管理局將積極與其他監管機構及國際標準制定機構保持聯繫。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金業務\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將對持牌機構在財富管理及證券銷售、強制性公積金（MPF）及其他投資及保險產品方面的監察及審查工作，重點關注粵港澳大灣區的跨境理財通（跨境WMC）計劃，以及數碼投顧平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資掛鉤的長期保險產品。\n\n香港金融管理局將在與其他監管機構及銀行業界保持密切聯繫的同時，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售提供進一步指引。此指引將涵蓋與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售保險連結計劃，這是一種具有較高保險保障水平的新型投資掛鉤保險產品。香港金融管理局、保險業監管局及強積金計劃管理局將聯手推出神秘購物計劃，以評估中介人銷售符合資格的延期年金保單及稅務扣減自願供款的銷售手法。\n\n跨境WMC順利推出後，香港金融管理局將繼續與業界及有關監管當局合作，進一步完善該計劃。\n\n此外，金管局將着手準備，以規範人工智能的信託業務，並將在新的SPM模組及新的實務指引下進行。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續推動其監管範疇內的金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全與效率，並將依據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》(PSSVFO)、《金融市場基礎設施原則》(PFMI)¹及支付及市場基礎設施委員會(CPMI)發出的各項指引來執行。香港金融管理局將根據最新的科技及市場發展，優化金融市場基礎設施的監管框架。\n\n香港金融管理局將與金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）合作，確保其遵守金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI），並適時進行及更新評估。此外，香港金融管理局將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO（支付與市場基礎設施委員會與國際證券委員會組織）關於PFMI實施監測與評估的工作。香港金融管理局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並根據市場及科技發展情況，以及配合國際慣例，加強其監管要求。香港金融管理局將與有關當局合作，在適當情況下進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 政策演進\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續完善及優化銀行監管及政策框架，並參考國際標準及最佳實踐。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾協議\n\n# 資本充足率要求\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續完善資本架構，並落實近年來巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）發布的標準。\n\n2013年12月銀行對基金的股權投資資本要求（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日生效，並於立法會完成負面審議後，根據《銀行（資本）（修訂）規則2022》開始實施。\n\n2017年12月《巴塞爾三號協議危機後改革最終版》、2019年1月《市場風險最低資本要求》（2019年2月修訂）以及2020年7月《針對信用風險價值調整風險框架的定向修訂》，統稱為「巴塞爾三號協議最終改革方案」。 這些標準規範了信用風險、市場風險、信用風險價值調整（CVA）風險和操作風險的資本處理方式，並引入了最低產出要求，同時強化了槓桿比率框架。 銀行（資本）規則（BCR）的修訂正與業界協商擬定中，預計將於2023年7月1日起生效作為最低要求，僅市場風險及CVA風險除外。\n\n鑒於巴塞爾資本協議（BCR）下的主權集中風險資本處理方式，旨在補充香港銀行業（風險限額）規則所實行的巴塞爾委員會大型風險框架，香港金融管理局將於相關風險限額規則變動同時，建議修訂資本規章。\n\n# 安全限值\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續與業界及律政司磋商，就《銀行（風險限額）規則》的建議修訂進行工作，目標是在與巴塞爾三框架最終改革方案一致的日期生效實施，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n與巴塞爾銀行監管委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發布的《支柱三披露要求 – 修訂框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》中，主要載列了與巴塞爾三號最終改革方案中修訂後的資本標準相關的披露要求。此外，巴塞爾銀行監管委員會亦於2019年6月發布《槓杆比率披露要求修訂》，旨在修訂杠杆比率的披露要求，以應對銀行在報告日期前後減少特定交易量以進行粉飾的潛在問題。為實施這些新的披露要求，香港金融管理局正準備對《銀行（披露）規則》進行相應修訂，預期其生效時間將與相關資本標準的修訂同步。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n為配合監管規定及國際標準的發展，香港金融管理局計劃更新若干《銀行業實務守則》（SPM）章節，包括與巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案中修訂後的資本及披露標準、關於實施逆周期資本緩衝的辦法、「銀行簿記的利率風險」、「新股認購及股份質押融資」和「壓力測試」相關的章節。香港金融管理局亦會繼續致力修訂《操守準則》及《銀行條例下認可機構外部審計師報告要求》相關的SPM章節，目標於2022年正式完成修訂。 鑒應建議修改《銀行（風險限額）規則》，相關的行為準則及SPM章節，例如關於「大型風險敞口及風險集中度」（CR-G-8）及關於「關連方風險」（CR-G-9），將相應地更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n","zh":"# 經濟金融領域\n\n憑藉強勁的商品出口、穩健的內需以及政府支持政策的推動，香港經濟於2021年恢復正增長，扭轉了2019年和2020年經歷的經濟收縮。勞動市場亦有所改善，通脹維持溫和，儘管略有上升。預期在第五波新冠疫情消退後，經濟復甦將持續，但其恢復的強勁程度和速度仍受不確定因素及風險影響，尤其與疫情發展以及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑相關。\n\n# 經濟總結\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在強勁的商品出口和本地需求持續改善的推動下，香港經濟在2021年錄得6.3%的增長，結束了2019年及2020年的經濟下滑（見表1及圖1）。私人消費支出隨著勞動市場改善以及政府消費券計劃的推出而有所回升。整體投資亦因商業環境和前景的改善而顯著反彈。外部方面，香港全年商品出口表現強勁，部分得益於全球經濟的持續復甦。服務出口則錄得溫和增長，反映區域貿易及貨運流量的活躍，以及跨境商業及金融活動的增強。總進口亦顯著上升，主要受本地需求及轉口貿易帶動。淨出口方面，2021年外貿對實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長貢獻正向，原因是總出口增長速度快於進口（見圖1）。\n\n表1 實質GDP增長率（按支出項目劃分）（與上期相比）\n\n備註：經季節調整後的國內固定資本形成總額變動率未提供。資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n核心通脹壓力在年內溫和上升，但整體仍屬溫和。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，核心通脹率逐步上升，至十二月達到溫和的1.4%（圖表2）。本地消費需求改善，餐飲、交通、服裝鞋類等消費品價格回升。同時，全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源與大宗商品價格上漲，導致進口價格顯著上升。相反，房屋價格則對整體通脹構成抑制作用，反映先前私人住宅租金下跌的影響（圖表2）。更廣泛地說，名義工資及商業租金增長放緩，有助於控制本地企業的成本壓力。整體而言，2021年核心通脹率與總體通脹率分別維持在0.6%與1.6%的溫和水平。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價通脹 來源：統計處。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，2021年勞動市場有所改善。在2月失業率創下17年來高點7.2%後，至12月顯著下降至4.0%（圖3），且此趨勢廣泛地見於各個經濟部門。總體勞動需求穩步增強，體現在總就業人數增加（圖3）以及民間部門職缺數量的上升，儘管這些數據仍未達疫情前的峰值。另一方面，與去年同期相比，12月勞動人口略為縮減1.3%，部分原因在於勞動參與率出現小幅下降。名義工資與勞動所得的年增長率雖然溫和，但在2021年前三個季度呈現加速趨勢，扭轉了2019年至2020年間的減速態勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況\n資料來源：香港統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在年內整體表現疲軟，儘管部分主要海外股市持續上漲（圖4）。恆生指數延續2020年底的反彈，於2021年2月17日升至31,085點高位，但此後市場情緒因多項因素急劇轉為負面，包括對新型冠狀病毒變種的擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及透過港股通南向交易的資金流入減少。截至年末，恆生指數收報23,398點，較去年同期下跌14.1%。\n\n圖表 4 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易所及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2021年上半年，受益於經濟前景的改善，住宅物業市場呈現出回升趨勢，但下半年則因投資者信心轉弱而出現盤整（見圖4）。總體而言，2021年住宅價格和成交量分別上漲3.7%和24.1%。家庭購房負擔能力亦進一步加重，部分原因在於家庭收入減少。另一方面，經歷了2019年和2020年的大幅調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍呈現改善態勢，工業物業的價格及租金已回升至疫情前的峰值，而零售及辦公室空間的價格則仍未達致各自的峰值。\n\n請參閱第326至327頁的B表：主要經濟指標，以了解更多詳情，包括2017年到2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟概況\n\n二零二二年年初，本地第五波新冠疫情對本地經濟活動造成壓力。為應對此情況，政府在二零二二至二零二三年度預算案下推出了第五及第六輪抗疫基金，並增加了額外逆周期措施，以支持經濟。香港金融管理局與銀行界同時將延期還款計劃延長至二零二二年十月底。\n\n整體而言，預計2022年經濟將持續復甦，但相較於2021年，增長幅度將會較為溫和。此趨勢部分反映了第五波新型冠狀病毒疫情的影響、全球經濟成長放緩、基期效應轉差，以及美國貨幣政策正趨於常態等因素。政府預估2022年實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長率將介於1%至2%之間，而國際機構與私人分析師的最新預測平均為1.1%。然而，經濟復甦的進展仍面臨諸多不確定性與風險，尤其與疫情發展、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策調整路徑相關的風險。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在進口價格上漲和疫情引發的物流中斷的影響下，短期內通脹壓力預計將有所上升，但由於租金持續低迷以及本地勞動成本壓力溫和，整體應當可控。市場共識預計2022年總體通脹率為2.4%，而政府則預測總體及核心通脹率分別為2.1%和2.0%。今年初，本地第五波新冠疫情對勞動市場造成影響，尤其是在高接觸服務業。長期來看，勞動市場狀況將取決於疫情發展以及本地經濟復甦的進程。\n\n# 銀行業績\n\n2021年香港銀行業持續保持穩定。總資產溫和擴張，貸款及存款均有所增長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況依然穩健。資產質素在歷史及國際標準下均維持健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表分析趨勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2021年增長了1.9%。在經濟復甦的帶動下，全年貸款總額增長3.8%，較2020年的1.2%高出0.6個百分點。其中，香港貸款增長4.4%，香港以外地區貸款增長1.1%，貿易融資則上升14.2%。內地相關貸款在2021年擴大3.6%，此前2020年則維持穩定。\n\n在負債方面，2021年總存款增加4.6%，較2020年的5.4%為高。由於總存款增長速度快於總貸款，截至2021年底，整體貸款與存款比率略降至71.8%，較去年底的72.3%（見圖5）。\n\n圖表5 銀行業的貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業的資本狀況維持良好。截至2021年底，本地註冊認可金融機構的綜合資本充足比率為20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（見圖6）。兩項比率均遠高於國際最低要求，分別為8%和6%。\n\n截至2021年底，巴塞爾III 槓桿比率為7.9%，遠高於法定最低要求的3%（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況穩健。第一類機構8的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）在2021年第四季為151.9%，顯著高於要求。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第二類金融機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦高於法定最低要求的25%（圖8）。\n\n圖8 指定銀行流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n銀行業的資金來源保持穩定。2021年底，一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低要求的100%。核心資金\n\n2A類機構的資本充足率（CFR）於2021年底為150.3%，遠高於法定最低要求的75%（圖9）。\n\n圖表9 指定AI的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資產評級\n\n資產質素在年內維持穩定，並符合歷史及國際標準的健康水平。截至2021年底，不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略為下降；逾期及重組貸款比率則微降至0.56%，較2020年底的0.57%（圖表10）。與內地相關貸款的不良貸款比率，截至2021年底為0.86%，較2020年底的0.96%有所改善。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率分別維持在0.04%及0.20%的低水平（圖表11）。香港金融管理局將繼續密切監察銀行業資產質素的變化。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n低利率環境持續對銀行業的盈利能力造成壓力。2021年零售銀行稅前營運利潤總額下降19.8%（見圖表12），主要由於淨利息收入減少（-13.6%）及總營運費用增加（+7.1%）。此部分影響，則由手續費及佣金收入增加（+9.6%）以及貸款減損費用下降（-25.1%）所部分抵消。2021年淨息差進一步收窄至0.98%，較2020年的1.18%（見圖表13）。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比率從2020年的47.0%上升至2021年的54.7%（圖14）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管新冠疫情的持續不確定性以及對美國貨幣政策緊縮的擔憂，香港的港元外匯及貨幣市場仍然保持暢順有序的交易。自一九八三年實施以來，聯匯制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並已展現出對外部衝擊的強大韌性。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持匯率穩定。此穩定是指香港幣對美元的外部匯率，在匯率市場上維持於港幣7.75至7.85元兌一美元的區間內。貨幣體系的結構特點是金管局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少以金管局持有的美元儲備為100%支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動均須與美元儲備的相應變動完全配合。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表1）由：\n\n債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供充分擔保；政府發行的紙幣和硬幣；結餘總額，即存放在香港金融管理局的結算賬戶餘額總和；以及香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性，透過自動調整利率的機制，以及香港金融管理局（金管局）堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）得以維持。當強方或弱方承諾被觸發時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求，以每美元7.75元或7.85元的價格，向銀行買入或賣出港元，以換取美元，從而擴大或縮減總餘額，藉此壓低或提高港元利率，協助港元匯率重回7.75至7.85元的聯繫匯率區間。\n\n# 2021 總結\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受集資活動及南向證券通所引發的相關需求，年初港元匯率接近聯繫匯率制度的強方一側。其後，由於股市回調及部分新上市企業回購首次公開發行（IPO）所得資金，港元一度走弱，但因企業股息支付需求及南向證券通的淨流入，第二季略為回升。進入下半年，雖然受股市情緒放緩影響，港元兌人民幣匯率一度回落，但整體仍維持在聯繫匯率制度的強方，並持續以平穩有序的方式交易（圖表1）。總體而言，2021年港元外匯市場運作正常。\n\n圖表 1 2021年市場匯率\n\n由於未觸發對沖資本緩衝（CUs），截至2021年末，總結餘與未償還外匯基金債券（EFBNs）總額的總和，幾乎沒有變化，維持在約1,526.3億港元左右（見圖2）。 該年內，金管局共發行總額800億港元的額外外匯基金債券，以應對銀行體系流動性充裕情況下，銀行對外匯基金債券的持續需求，導致總結餘從2020年末的457.5億港元縮減至2021年末的377.5億港元。\n\n反映根據既定慣例，額外發行外匯基金儲券，並以應付外匯基金儲券的利息支出，本年度外匯基金儲券結餘由港幣1,069.2億增至港幣1,148.8億。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 港幣1,526.3億元\n\n總額及未結清的EFBNs\n\n圖表 2：2021 年綜合結餘（貼現窗口前）及未償還之交換基金票據\n\n# 資金市場\n\n受益於龐大的結餘，香港銀行同業拆息利率在全年內大致維持在低水平（圖3）。儘管第一季因首次公開發行活動而對港元需求增加，但各期限的香港銀行間拆息率（HIBOR）波動不大。其後，即使面對美國貨幣緊縮的影響，HIBOR仍維持穩定。2021年末，HIBOR呈現輕微上升，部分反映年末資金需求。在零售方面，各銀行維持最優惠貸款利率不變。總體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作。2021年，貼現窗借款減少至68億港元，較2020年的91億港元有所下降。\n\n圖3 2021年香港銀行同業利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）已在香港金融體系中屹立三十餘年，並在歷次挑戰中展現出其堅實的基礎與韌性。儘管全球經濟復甦道路仍存在不確定性，港元匯率及貨幣市場卻持續有序運作，充分反映了LERS的穩健性。香港特區政府堅定支持LERS的運作。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在其2021年《外部部門報告》中再次強調，LERS的可信度得益於一套透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、嚴謹的金融監管、靈活的經濟體制以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n健全的銀行體系對常設性貸款擔保計劃（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續穩健運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率遠超國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局已密切監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對銀行信貸的監管工作。\n\n外匯基金帳戶的透明度至關重要，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分撥作支持貨幣基礎之用。2021年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）的數值維持在109.8%至110.5%之間，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率為110.2%（見圖4）。根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。外匯基金充足的財政資源，加上穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖表4 2021年擔保比率的日波動\n\n# 貨幣委員會專責小組\n\n香港金融管理局諮詢委員會下的貨幣局委員會（CBC）負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。 2021年，CBC 審議了包括評估美國通脹情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估縮減規模引發的市場動盪及其對香港的影響，以及了解與中國內地相關的資金流動對香港貨幣狀況的影響等議題。 CBC就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣局運作報告，均會在香港金融管理局網站上發佈。\n\n# 紙幣和硬幣\n\n於2021年底，票據發行銀行發行的紙幣流通總值為5926億港元，較按年增加5.9%（圖表5、6及7）。政府發行的紙幣及硬幣流通總值，於2021年底達129億港元，較按年增加1.7%（圖表8及9）。\n\n# 港幣592.6億元，+5.9%\n\n發鈔銀行所代表的紙幣總價值\n\n# 港元129億，+1.7%\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣總價值\n\n# 圖表 5\n\n2021年底，發鈔銀行流通中的紙幣\n\n# 圖表六\n\n截至2021年底，流通紙幣的分布\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n年內，香港金融管理局舉辦了14場研討會，超過4,000名參與者參加，包括銀行及零售業專業人士以及學生，旨在提升他們辨別真偽港幣的知識及技能。這些關於香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵的公眾教育項目，深受歡迎。\n\n# 硬幣收藏計劃\n\n硬幣收藏計劃受到公眾的歡迎。更多關於此計劃的資訊，請參閱第198頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n# 外匯基金短期票據及票據\n\n外匯基金注資計劃（EFBN Programme）持續順利運作。為滿足銀行體系流動性充裕情況下，銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，香港金融管理局於2021年下半年共發行總額800億港元的額外外匯基金票據。此舉導致總結餘相應減少。截至2021年底，未償還外匯基金票據的總面值為1,148.6億港元（見表2）。\n\n表2 交易所基金債券及票據之未償還餘額\n\n# 金融研究\n\n香港貨幣及金融研究中心（HKIMR）於2021年，儘管全球疫情持續，仍維持穩定的研究產出。當年，HKIMR共發布了30篇工作論文，並舉辦了九場網絡研討會，內容涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定性、市場微結構以及金融科技（Fintech）發展等廣泛主題。HKIMR同時亦舉辦了一場國際研討會及一場混合形式的網絡研討會。\n\n人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望研討會於八月十七日與香港金融學院聯合舉辦，並在多個網絡平台進行直播，吸引了超過一百一十六萬即時觀看人數。\n\n第十一屆國際中國經濟研討會，主題為「邁向共同富裕：中國雙循環經濟發展」，於11月11日舉行。會議探討了與共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷法規、房地產市場、粵港澳大灣區理財通以及大灣區金融發展等相關的最新政策。專家學者就人口老齡化對社會保障基金的可持續性影響，以及中國對全球金融穩定與世界經濟的貢獻等議題，進行了分析。本次研討會共設六個主題，吸引了超過三千兩百名線上及現場觀眾，總觀看次數達五千九百次。\n\n"}

During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2021年維持穩健，儘管當時新型冠狀病毒變異株出現，對全球經濟復甦造成不確定性。當年，香港金融管理局持續監督授權機構的風險管理。為應對日益嚴峻的網絡威脅及銀行業的數位化進程，管理局亦加強了對授權機構營運及網絡韌性的監督。\n\n在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局向銀行提供指引，以促進透過非現場渠道推廣投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，制定市場上新產品（如保險債券及虛擬資產）的監管要求。銀行業操守守則亦已更新，以加強數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）領域，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的首要任務是進一步強化銀行在生態系統中的把關角色，以及其預防和偵測與疫情期間網絡詐騙、馬伕賬戶網絡及其他金融犯罪相關的非法資金流動的能力。為提高客戶帳戶對詐騙及金融犯罪的防護，金管局透過公私合作夥伴關係加強與其他相關方的協作與資訊共享。在支持遠程客戶開戶的同時，金管局亦鼓勵採用其他技術，包括網絡分析，並於11月推出了首個反洗錢監管科技實驗室。在國際層面，金管局積極參與，使其在金融行動任務執行機構的全球AML\/CFT工作中處於領先地位。\n\n粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通試點計劃於九月順利啟動。年內，香港金融管理局持續推行為期兩年的監管科技（RegTech）應用路線圖。為支持銀行應對氣候風險，並更廣泛地推動綠色及可持續銀行業務，已推出一系列措施，詳情見《可持續發展》專章。此外，在軟基礎設施方面亦加強了建設，包括倡導以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業界合作，推行能力建設計劃，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，香港金融管理局與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監管政策及程序。在本地推行國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率及資訊披露等。香港金融管理局持續推進相關工作，以確保授權機構擁有可靠的應急處理機制，當中包括制定新的應急標準，並實施有關損失吸收能力的要求，藉此提升授權機構的應對能力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於一個高度韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過營運方式，或在極端情況下因應無序倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。 貨幣審查局作為監管機構，致力於維護金融穩定，確保銀行具備應對衝擊的能力，並能在危機中迅速恢復，從而有效預防金融機構的倒閉。 貨幣審查局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並有權在香港授權持牌銀行、限牌銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（Authorized Institutions，簡稱AIs）。\n\n香港金融管理局無法保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保金融系統完全沒有風險。相反地，作為處置機構，香港金融管理局致力於確保當授權機構（AI）出現經營困難時，其相關事宜可有序處理。為此，香港已建立一套針對金融機構的處置機制，根據該機制，香港金融管理局是負責處理授權機構及其他類型機構的處置事宜。為在香港落實此機制，必須制定處置規則和政策標準，進行處置規劃以消除影響授權機構可被妥善處理的障礙，並提升香港金融管理局處理經營困難授權機構的能力。為有效執行這些任務，香港金融管理局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施。為確保這些基礎設施的整體安全及效率，金管局致力於限制系統性風險，並提升透明度。強化這些基礎設施應對金融危機的韌性，有助於保障香港的貨幣及金融體系，免受其運作中斷可能造成的影響。有關金管局的監管方法，敬請瀏覽金管局網站。\n\n# 2021 回顧\n\n# 授權相關\n\n二零二一年底，香港：\n\n年內，香港金融管理局批出兩張銀行牌照及一張受限制銀行牌照予三間非本地銀行。金管局亦批准一間外地交易平台營運商從事貨幣經紀業務。年內，三間持牌銀行及兩間受限制牌照銀行的牌照被撤銷。\n\n有關人工智能及香港本地代表處的更多資訊，請參閱附件及第321至324頁的表D至F，以及第330至333頁的表D至F。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n香港金融管理局進行了189項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技（金融科技）策略。為持續加強風險監管，金管局共舉行了40場會議，與持牌金融機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會進行交流。此外，金管局、持牌金融機構及其外部審計師還舉行了38場三方會議。\n\n除現場檢查外，金管局亦定期進行現場檢查，並配合專題審查，重點關注評估風險較高的範疇。 該年度共進行了679項現場檢查及專題審查，其中信貸風險管理為重點。 隨著銀行對科技的應用日益普及，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦成為另一重點關注領域。 金管局同時增加了針對流動性風險和市場風險管理的現場檢查及專題審查次數。 此外，專門團隊亦對人工智能機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動，以及其反洗錢及打擊資助恐怖主義（AML\/CFT）控制措施進行現場檢查及專題審查。 表1總結了金管局2021年的監管活動。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款額在2021年增長3.8%，相較於2020年的1.2%。表2顯示貸款及信貸增長的細分。\n\n與內地相關的貸款在2021年增加了3.6%，達到4,725.0億港元（表3）。\n\n銀行業的資產質素全年大致維持穩定，並保持在歷史及國際標準下皆健康的水平。截至2021年底，行業不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。與內地相關貸款的比率亦由去年同期的0.96%降至0.86%。\n\n年內，新冠疫情持續對部分經濟範疇造成影響，而內地房地產市場的信貸事件亦引起市場關注。香港金融管理局加強了監察的廣度和深度，並對銀行對高槓桿借款人的風險敞口進行深入審查。為及時評估經濟及市場發展對銀行業務的影響，並確保銀行風險管理措施的充足性，金管局與各銀行保持緊密溝通。經評估，銀行體系面臨的整體信貸風險可控。金管局最新的資本充足度壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系持續維持充足的資本緩衝，足以應對極端壓力。\n\n本年度針對貸款分類、貸款損失準備、海外貸款業務及向私人銀行及資產管理客戶提供的擔保貸款，進行了有針對性的審查，以評估相關人工智能系統的控制機制。\n\n# 紓解客戶現金流壓力\n\n九月，香港金融管理局與銀行界中小企業信貸協調機制宣布將預先批准本金還款寬限期計劃 (Pre-approved Principal Repayment Grace Period Scheme) 延期六個月，至2022年4月底。該計劃於2020年5月首次推出，旨在為合資格企業客戶延遲償還貸款本金六個月。鑒於本地新型冠狀病毒疫情反彈，2022年2月，該計劃進一步延長至2022年10月底。同時，計劃亦提供為期一年的部分本金還款選項，讓財務狀況允許且有意逐步恢復本金償還的客戶可選擇此方案。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准超過83,000宗貸款期限延長及其他緩釋措施，總金額逾9200億港元。針對個人客戶，銀行已批准超過52,000宗住宅按揭貸款及其他個人紓困貸款的本金寬限期，總金額逾530億港元。\n\n# 房產按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）陸續推出的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，有效提升了銀行業的風險管理水平，並增強了其應對本地樓市可能出現的急跌風險的能力。截至2021年12月，獲批准的新住宅按揭貸款（RMLs）的平均按揭成數為53%，較2009年9月首次推出相關措施前的64%顯著下降。同期，新按揭貸款的平均償債比率（DSR）維持於36%，較2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%為低（見圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局鑑於銀行日益依賴科技以支持其運作，已加強對運作及科技風險的監管。本年度的重點監管範疇包括對雲端外包及遠程工作安排的控制。香港金融管理局於12月發起行業諮詢，就監管政策手冊（SPM）新模組「運作韌性」的草案進行討論。新SPM模組旨在為銀行提供指引，協助其建立全面且整合的運作韌性架構。\n\n香港金融管理局於一月推出《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》，以反映最新的網絡安全風險管理良好實踐。年內，香港金融管理局監察持牌金融機構實施《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》的情況，並審閱其網絡韌性能力。鑒於破壞性網絡攻擊的風險日益增加，香港金融管理局於五月要求所有持牌金融機構參照香港銀行同業公會（HKAB）發布的《安全三級資料備份指引》，評估是否需要安全的三級資料備份。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界緊密合作，加強網上及手機銀行服務的安全性，以應對日益增加的風險及網絡釣魚攻擊。為提升公眾意識，香港金融管理局與香港銀行公會於七月展開一項大型聯合宣傳活動，主題為「保護您的個人數碼密匙；謹防詐騙連結！」（見圖1）。\n\n圖1 提高公眾對釣魚攻擊的意識\n\n保護您的個人數位鑰匙；提防詐騙連結！圖示\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n為加強監控人工智能（AI）的流動性風險，香港金融管理局已將更多情境納入其流動性壓力測試框架，以評估人工智能在持續一段時間內應對流動性衝擊的能力。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於本年度進行主題審查，以評估授權機構（AIs）流動性壓力測試計劃的充分性，並評估其監測指標及控制限額在管理流動性風險方面的有效性。HKMA 亦進行審查，以評估授權機構在債券投資方面的市場風險管理架構，以及對庫務活動的操作控制。\n\n香港金融管理局密切監察授權機構在準備轉移離倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）方面的進展。管理局與業界協會合作，並開發工具協助授權機構支持客戶轉向替代參考利率，包括發放資訊說明，以提高企業對轉移的認識，以及發佈貸款市場可用以取代美元LIBOR的資訊通訊。授權機構已大幅改善了在2021年底後不再發佈的LIBOR參考利率的合約。管理局亦提醒授權機構，自2022年1月1日起不得訂立新的LIBOR合約。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .\n","zh":"# 國際金融樞紐\n\n在2021年，香港金融管理局透過多管齊下的方式，成功鞏固了香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局公佈「金融科技2025」策略，旨在推廣金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並進一步鞏固香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。在快速支付系統方面，受新型冠狀病毒疫情影響，本年度交易額顯著增長。\n\n在提升連通性方面，今年已取得顯著進展，新增「跨境理財通」及債券通南向交易，擴充了連線計劃的內容。 憑藉香港世界一流的市場基礎設施及連線計劃，香港已成為內地資金連接全球市場，以及國際投資者進入快速發展的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n在2021年，香港金融管理局投放大量資源，積極開拓新的商機，以提升香港金融平台的競爭力，重點領域包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心，以及綠色及可持續金融。為推廣香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強了與海外及內地機構的聯繫，向其展示香港金融體系的穩健性及其發展潛力。\n\n同時，香港金管局亦積極參與國際及區內中央銀行和監管機構的論壇，為維護全球金融穩定及促進金融市場發展貢獻力量。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局宣布其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列推動金融科技廣泛應用及鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐地位的舉措。 金融管理局金融科技促進辦事處（FFO）與銀行部門合作，在過去一年中，在多項關鍵項目上扮演了重要角色，其中包括：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）的採用\n推行科技基線評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位穩固不移，年內離岸人民幣業務錄得顯著增長。 隨著主要金融市場指數持續納入內地證券，流入人民幣資產的規模亦持續擴大。香港在促進國際投資者增加配置人民幣資產方面扮演著關鍵角色，內地與香港的滬港通及深港通等互聯互通機制，已成為國際投資者進入內地資本市場的首選途徑。截至2021年，北向債券通的每日成交額增長34%，達到約人民幣258億元。\n\n繼北向債券通成功開通後，南向債券通於九月開通，完成了內地與國際債券市場的雙向互聯互通。同月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）、香港金融管理局（HKMA）及澳門金融管理局聯合公布了粵港澳大灣區（GBA）跨境財富管理通（Crossboundary WMC）計劃的具體執行細則。十月，香港符合資格的銀行開始與其內地合作銀行一同提供跨境財富管理通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為主要離岸人民幣中心的作用，香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易所（港交所）組成工作小組，進行可行性研究，探討在香港推廣以人民幣計價的股權證券交易。此外，中國人民銀行與香港金融管理局於十二月合辦研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領先人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局持續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為增加香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，為基金設立提供更有利的稅務及監管環境。同時，金管局亦有顯著進展，進一步鞏固香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心，以及債券發行中心的地位。此外，金管局積極推廣香港的金融服務，向海外及內地機構及投資者宣傳。\n\n安全及高效的金融基礎設施運作，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心之領導地位至關重要。 2021年，四個銀行間即時總額結算系統（RTGS）、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港貿易資料庫均實現了100%的系統穩定性，超出目標的99.95%。 隨著2021年9月南向債券通推出後，中央貨幣市場單位成為了北向債券通及南向債券通交易的結算及服務提供者。\n\n快速支付系統的採用於2021年持續擴展。截至2021年底，註冊用戶數增至960萬人，全年平均每日交易額較2020年上升90%。除了個人對個人及商業支付的穩定增長外，使用快速支付系統繳納政府帳單、進行商戶付款以及為儲值服務電子錢包或銀行帳戶充值，是推動交易量持續增長的主要因素。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業界的安全及效率，香港金管局監察六個指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監督十五間已發牌儲值支付工具發牌機構。 於本年度，金管局協調相關政府部門與獲委任參與政府消費券計劃的儲值支付工具發牌機構，以配合及推動計劃的順利進行。\n\n二零二二年一月，香港金融管理局發佈了一份關於加密資產及穩定幣的討論文件，闡述了金管局就相關監管方法的初步看法，並邀請各持份者提供意見。制定適當的監管框架時，將會考慮相關因素，包括對此討論文件的回饋意見以及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n香港金融管理局在國際上是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。例如，香港金融管理局主持東亞太平洋中央銀行高級別會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）。此外，香港金融管理局同時與巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（Basel Committee）的政策與標準小組、非銀行監測專家小組及金融穩定理事會（FSB）的金融創新網絡共同協商，並領導一個專責團隊，研究與金融指標轉型相關的監管問題。\n\n# 2021總結\n\n# 香港金融科技樞紐\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n六月，香港金融管理局公布《金融科技2025》策略，旨在促進香港金融科技的蓬勃發展。該策略力求於2025年前鼓勵金融界全面採用科技，並促進提供公平及高效的金融服務，惠及香港市民和經濟。該策略的五個重點領域如下：\n\n所有銀行積極轉向金融科技\n為香港布局央行數位貨幣（CBDC）的未來\n構建新一代數據基礎設施\n擴展具備金融科技專業知識的人才隊伍\n以資金與政策扶植生態系統發展\n\n香港金管局的「金融科技2025」策略推動香港金融科技發展。\n\n# 金融科技導入銀行業\n\n為配合「金融科技2025」策略，香港金融管理局於2021年6月推出「科技基礎評估」。此評估旨在幫助金管局更深入了解香港銀行業的金融科技發展，並識別哪些領域可能需要金管局的支持。所有在香港有重要業務的持牌銀行，均被要求於2021年底前制定為期三年的金融科技採用計劃。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局亦繼續推行為期兩年的路線圖，以推動香港銀行採用監管科技（Regtech），並在其自身的監管流程中融入科技，以提高效率和成效。有關更多詳情，請參閱《銀行穩定性專章》第98頁。\n\n# 批發央行數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局與泰國銀行於2021年2月擴展其聯合研究計劃，並加入了阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所。該計劃重組為「多國央行數字貨幣橋樑（mBridge）」，並獲得國際清算銀行（BIS）香港創新中心的大力支持，進一步探討分布式賬本技術的應用能力，以實現多司法管轄領域下全天候的實時跨境外匯支付對支付（PvP）交易。2021年9月發表聯合報告，披露初步研究成果，隨後於11月發布潛在應用場景及未來發展藍圖。\n\n# 零售中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n為提升香港在央票（CBDC）領域的準備程度，香港金管局已展開一項研究，探討在香港發行零售CBDC（即e-HKD）的可行性，涵蓋技術及政策層面。為探討發行零售CBDC的技術層面，香港金管局與香港BIS創新中心合作，啟動名為「Project Aurum」的研究。 此外，金管局亦成立了一個跨部門內部工作小組，研究相關的技術、政策及法律問題。十月份，金管局發布了一份名為《e-HKD：技術視角》的技術白皮書，旨在探討並徵求公眾對發行及分發零售CBDC潛在技術設計方案的意見。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局支持中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所，就跨境支付使用e-CNY進行技術試點。此舉有助於提升大灣區互聯互通，並透過提升跨境支付的效率及用戶體驗，為香港及內地旅客帶來更多便利。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n今年七月，香港金融管理局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行及SVF營運商加入CDI（下一代金融數據基礎設施），旨在提升銀行體系內金融中介的效率。為進一步推動CDI的發展及應用，研討會上宣布啟動CDI創新中心。為促進中小企業（SME）融資，香港金融管理局已完成兩階段的概念驗證研究，探討CDI的技術可行性。研究期間，參與銀行應用替代數據進行貸款承保，共批准超過550筆總額逾9億港元的中小企業貸款。基於積極成果，香港金融管理局於11月宣布啟動CDI試點上線。\n\n中小企業主肯定CDI簡化了貸款申請流程。\n\n# 人才發展與提升\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局持續與策略合作夥伴共同推行「金融科技職業加速器計劃2.0」，以培育各個職業發展階段的年輕人才。2021年，超過180名學生受惠於此計劃。另外，為提供金融科技專業碩士生參與實際業界項目的機會，於九月試行「業界項目碩士網絡」計劃。為建立策略合作關係，並促進包括金融科技人才發展在內各領域的合作，香港金融管理局於十月與四所本地大學簽訂合作備忘錄。\n\n高禮遜先生（Colin Pou）（中），香港金融管理局金融基礎設施執行董事，於與四所本地大學簽署諒解備忘錄儀式上。\n\n# 金融科技監管測試環境\n\n金融科技監管沙盒 (FSS) 的使用持續上升。截至2021年12月底，自2016年啟動以來，已批准234項金融科技試點計劃，較2020年底的193項增加。同期的香港金融管理局，自2017年起已收到總計666宗申請，冀望透過對話平台獲取金融科技專案初期階段的監管意見。其中，超過63%的申請來自科技公司。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n二零二一年，全球金融市場展開復甦。儘管全球經濟持續受到新型冠狀病毒疫情的影響，但受益於疫苗接種率上升、各國寬鬆的貨幣政策以及財政措施等多重因素，全球經濟和金融市場均呈現顯著復甦態勢。在此背景下，多個海外股市創下歷史新高，而金融管理局的整體股票投資組合，即使在香港股市表現相對平穩的情況下，亦能取得良好回報。二零二一年，金融管理局錄得投資收益一千九百一十九億港元，投資回報率為百分之四點一。\n\n# 香港交易所基金\n\n外匯基金的主要目標，按照《外匯基金條例》的規定，是直接或間接調控香港貨幣的匯價。該基金亦可維持香港的貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以協助香港作為國際金融中心。香港金融管理局在財政司司長的授權下，就外匯基金的使用和投資管理對財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金管理\n\n# 投資組合架構\n\n香港金融管理局基金諮詢委員會已為香港金融管理局基金制定了以下投資目標：\n\n維護資本價值；\n確保貨幣基礎在任何時候皆完全由高度流動的美元資產支持；\n確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n於遵守上述(一)至(三)的前提下，達成有助於維持交易所基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分體現了儲備基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖一 聯匯基金投資組合區分\n\n外匯基金基本上由兩個主要投資組合構成：儲備投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。儲備投資組合持有高度流動性的美元資產，以支持貨幣基礎，符合聯繫匯率制度的要求。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員經濟體的債券和股權市場，旨在維護其資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更有效地管理風險並提高中長期的回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以謹慎及漸進的方式，將儲備基金的一部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合（IP）持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。為引導LTGP的多元化進程，香港金融管理局自成立以來一直實施投資上限。隨著LTGP的投資規模和資產多樣性日益成熟，儲備基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）於2022年1月決定，以目標資產配置取代此上限，該配置將與其他資產類別的配置同時確定，並遵循謹慎的風險管理原則。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，此股份由政府為策略性目的而購入，以供外匯基金使用。由於其特殊性，策略投資組合並未納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 交換基金的配置\n\n交換基金不時會接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的受託。利率通常與IP2的表現掛鉤，主要例外是未來基金，其利率則根據投資組合比例，與IP及長期增值計劃（LTGP）的回報掛鉤。2021年，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資步驟\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資標竿中，代表聯匯基金的投資目標所決定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會以戰術方式配置，試圖在標竿之上取得超額回報。這意味著實際配置通常與標竿（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與標竿配置之間的差異被稱為「戰術性偏差」。雖然標竿和追蹤誤差的限制由財政司長諮詢聯匯基金監察委員會（EFAC）後決定，戰術性決策以及戰術性偏差的允許範圍則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）在授權下制定和設定。在允許的戰術性偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可以建立頭寸，以利用短期的市場波動（圖2）。\n\n圖2 外匯基金資產配置\n\n# 投資顧問服務\n\n# 純粹的直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的外匯基金投資辦公室負責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室的職員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括全部的BP及部分IP。這部分IP包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多種衍生工具風險管理組合，用以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 採用外聘管理人員\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦委託外部基金管理機構管理約29%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產類別。此舉旨在利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續回報，並發揮多元且互補的投資策略，藉此獲取投資方面的市場洞察及專業技術。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅費。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管控與遵循\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。香港金融管理局為內部及外部管理的投資組合，制定嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並確保建立完善的風險監測及合規系統。為有效實施風險管理，已建立三道防線，以保障投資相關活動的穩健運作。主要風險類別（包括信貸風險、市場風險、流動性風險及營運風險）會定期監測，風險管理程序提供穩健的框架，支持戰略規劃及投資多元化。\n\n# 可持續投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）認為，透過適當強調負責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，有助於更有效地實現儲備基金的投資目標，並降低其相關投資所涉及的環境、社會及管治（ESG）風險。香港金融管理局支持負責任投資，將ESG因素融入儲備基金的公眾及私人市場投資決策，其指導原則為：若投資的長期風險調整後的收益與其他投資相若，則通常會優先考慮ESG投資。如需了解更多有關香港金融管理局負責任投資框架及實施細節，請參閱第184至191頁的可持續發展專章。\n\n# --- 交易所基金績效 ---\n\n# 二零二一年金融市場\n\n全球股市在極為寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施推動下急劇上漲，創下新高，帶動全球經濟和金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港及內地股市表現遜色，此時正值市場改革期間。美國標準普爾500指數上漲27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌14%。\n\n對於債券市場而言，2021年美國聯準會（Fed）縮減購債規模，加上通膨預期上升，導致美國國債殖利率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債殖利率從年初的0.9%上漲至年底的1.5%，增長約60個基點。\n\n在外匯市場中，美元在2021年底對其他主要貨幣走強，主要受到市場對聯準會逐步縮減購債規模預期的影響。歐元和日圓對美元分別貶值了7.1%和10.3%。\n\n2021年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現，詳見表一。\n\n# 香港匯reserve基金的表現\n\n外匯基金於2021年錄得投資收入1919億港元。其中，債券收益為126億港元，股權淨收益為478億港元，分別來自海外股權的688億港元收益及香港股權的210億港元虧損。此外，非港元資產的貨幣兌換效應帶來168億港元收益，而基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資則帶來1147億港元收益。 另，策略投資組合錄得31億港元的估值收益。\n\n聯匯基金總資產於年底達致4,570.2億港元。長期資產管理計劃（LTGP）的投資總市值為515.3億港元，其中私募股權為392.5億港元，房地產為122.8億港元。LTGP的未履行投資承諾總額為225.7億港元。\n\n2021年，交易所基金（不包括戰略投資組合）的投資回報為4.1%。其中，IP的回報率為3.7%，而BP則增長0.4%。自2009年成立以來，長期投資組合（LTGP）的年化內部報酬率為15.4%。\n\n外匯基金一九九四年至二零二一年年度回報載於圖表一。表二顯示二零二一年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。二零一九年至二零二一年期間的平均回報為5.3％，二零一七年至二零二一年期間為4.7％，二零一二年至二零二一年期間為3.3％，自一九九四年起則為4.8％。表三顯示基金於二零二一年十二月三十一日的資產貨幣組成。\n\n請參閱第211至319頁，以查閱聯匯基金經審計的2021年財務報表。\n"}

The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","zh":"# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局的內部運作以高度的透明度、問責性、效率和專業精神為基礎。為促進公眾對其政策及運作的理解，香港金融管理局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通。在機構內部，香港金融管理局致力建立一支敏捷且可持續的團隊，實施嚴謹的財政紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以適應變遷，確保政策和措施的有效實施。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體公關與社交媒體\n\n金管局與傳媒保持緊密合作，以提升透明度及增進公眾對其政策和運作的認識。 2021年，金管局舉行或舉辦了169項實體和線上活動，包括八場記者會、八場現場訪問及153項其他公眾活動。 此外，另安排了27次媒體專訪。 全年共發佈了632份雙語新聞發佈稿，並每日處理頻繁的媒體查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局為本地、內地及海外傳媒舉辦了記者會及簡報會，主題包括互聯互通機制、金融科技（fintech）及利率基準改革。\n\n香港金融管理局為及時與公眾互動，維持Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube等五個社交媒體平台，現已累積超過8萬名關注者。 金融管理局利用這些平台，加強公眾對各類議題的認識，尤其關注疫情期間顯著增加的網絡釣魚詐騙。 此外，亦積極透過社交媒體推廣綠色金融、金融科技及「互聯互通計劃」等，讓公眾隨時掌握最新的發展趨勢。\n\n葉志堅先生，香港金融管理局首席行政員，主持了2021年香港金融科技週的虛擬論壇。\n\n李浩然先生，香港金融管理局副行政總裁，將主持一場關於金管局「金融科技 2025」策略的媒體簡報會。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁袁 Arthur 主持記者會，介紹香港銀行業為應對倫敦銀行同業拆息率過渡的準備。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁劉焯灝接受國際新聞頻道訪問\n\n# 公眾諮詢\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的公眾查詢服務為公眾提供有效途徑，以便更深入了解其主要職能及運作。 2021年，該服務共處理了9,781宗查詢。 其中約一半的查詢涉及銀行政策及規則、零售銀行服務、紙幣與硬幣，以及金融基礎設施和債券市場的發展。 較受關注的查詢包括有關硬幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2018年以來接獲的公眾查詢數目，圖表2則提供2021年按查詢性質劃分的分類。\n\n圖表 1：公眾查詢總數\n\n圖表2 2021年收到的查詢類型\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了香港金融管理局年報外，金管局亦發佈了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》，以及四期《季刊》，並定期更新《月度統計通訊》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊及分析。金管局同時亦發布了11期《inSight1》文章，介紹其主要的新舉措及政策，並探討受關注的主題。\n\n香港金融管理局《2020年年報》於香港管理協會2021年度最佳年報頒獎典禮中，榮獲「非牟利及慈善機構」組別的銀獎，並獲得環境、社會及管治報告卓越獎。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n香港金融管理局的網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過四萬四千頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的重要資源。網站內載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條維護的認可金融機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及認可金融機構證券人員登記冊，還包括根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維護的儲值設施牌照持有人登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2018年起，已分階段透過開放應用程式介面（API）在其網站上發布財務數據及重要資訊。截至2021年底，HKMA已在其網站上開放148組開放API，符合預定的時間表。\n\n# 資訊服務中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向公眾介紹金管局的工作，並提升市民對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要設施。中心設有展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式展示金管局的工作內容，以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，並提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資料及展品，供公眾參閱。圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過二萬六千冊關於香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行議題的書籍、期刊及其他出版物。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，備存持牌機構及其本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及持牌機構證券人員的登記冊，供公眾查閱。\n\n為保障公眾健康與安全，資訊中心於 COVID-19 疫情期間實施特別運作安排。已加強消毒工作，並定期以抗菌塗層為設施及展覽進行消毒。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的展覽區包括政策展區、貨幣展區和歷史時間軸。\n\n# 社區參與及公眾教育\n\n為提高公眾對香港金融管理局（HKMA）工作的認識，該局自1998年起推行公眾教育計劃。2021年，該局舉辦了一場網上研討會，吸引了來自84間中學的逾2,300名學生和教師參與。研討會內容涵蓋了該局的工作概覽、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字密鑰的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的就業機會。至今，已有逾63,000人參與了該計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局致力教育市民，成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。 鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙日益猖獗，金管局展開一項以「保護您的個人資料，小心不明連結！」為主題的公眾宣傳活動，並透過多媒體平台進行推廣，呼籲市民時刻留意以銀行名義發送的短訊及電郵，切勿點擊可疑連結。\n\n跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾提防惡意連結。\n\n香港金融管理局亦致力提升公眾對金融業的認識，並激發年輕一代對從事金融行業的興趣。 繼2020年網上劇集《STEPS》取得良好回響後，金管局推出新一輯名為《中環金融人才》的劇集，介紹金融業的四大增長領域：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。 該劇集以幽默的方式刻劃了市場從業者的角色，並邀請資深業界人士及年輕人才分享在上述四大領域的工作性質、職位機會及發展前景的經驗。\n\n《中央金融市場人才類型系列》讓年輕一代跟上金融市場的職涯發展資訊。\n\n香港金融管理局於2020年推出的「線上親子教育活動」，榮獲2021年《市場互動》市場活動大獎「最佳活動—企業社會責任」類別的銀獎。為延續活動的成功，香港金融管理局進一步推出一系列新措施，包括一場親子理財教育工作坊，邀請兒童教育專家分享如何培養孩子良好的理財觀念，並示範一款自製的理財教育玩具，以及一場香港金融管理局資訊中心的虛擬動畫導覽。\n\n線上親職與教育推廣活動榮獲2021年行銷活動大獎。此活動旨在透過輕鬆有趣的方式，向家長和孩子們推廣理財觀念與技能。\n\n為提升中學生的財務素養，香港金融管理局與各持份者合辦了以金融科技為主題的「香港財務素養錦標賽」。除了網上測驗外，更增設了個人財務管理方面的金融設計思維工作坊，旨在培訓參與學生設計創新的理財工具。此項計劃榮獲教育局「商校合作計劃」頒發的「最高學生參與獎」，以及投資者及財務教育委員會（IFEC）頒發的「投資者及財務教育獎（企業組）—黃金獎」。\n\n「香港金融素養錦標賽」向學生教授金融科技及設計思維概念，並創下歷來最高參與人數。\n\n其他社區參與計劃包括為學生和退休人士舉辦的講座或網上研討會。金管局亦參與了教育局主辦的有關經濟安全的教師培訓網上研討會。為方便在香港生活，來自不同背景的人士，我們提供八種語言的網上教育資料，內容包含使用自動櫃員機（ATM）的實用提示3。\n\n香港金融管理局支持投資者教育委員會在香港推廣金融素養及能力，並將與相關持份者進一步合作，以最大化社區參與的影響力。\n\n# 財務申報\n\n為維持高水平的透明度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在適用於中央銀行營運的情況下，採納國際財務披露標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他相關的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發布標準。財務處與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告準則編製及呈報外匯基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦在其年度報告中提供詳盡的披露，並對廣泛的費用項目及預算資訊進行深入分析。\n\n# 問責與控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）最重要職責之一是管理對貨幣及銀行體系的風險。風險管理既在日常運作的工作層面進行，亦透過策略規劃在高層次上實施。根據金管局的風險管理架構，設有兩個高層委員會——宏觀監控委員會及風險委員會，兩者均由金管局總裁主持。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的職權範圍為：\n\n識別香港貨幣及金融體系潛在的風險及威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可能措施；檢討現有管理貨幣及金融體系風險的措施，以識別可能存在的不足，並確保這些措施的充分性；以及鼓勵跨部門分享有關宏觀監測的相關資訊，以提升香港金融管理局的宏觀監測能力。\n\n風險委員會的職權和職責規範為：\n\n識別潛在風險及威脅，並制定策略以降低其影響；審查現有跨部門風險管理體系，以評估潛在漏洞及重大風險，並確保應對措施的充分性；統一風險評估標準及方法，並優先配置資源以管理已識別風險；以及，鼓勵建立健全的組織風險管理文化，促進適當的授權與控制。\n\n已建立一套完善的營運風險管理框架，涵蓋組織層面的兩級風險：組織層面及部門層面。組織層面風險主要指影響整個組織的中長期風險，或可能需要跨部門協調應對的風險。各業務單位識別出的潛在及新興風險，以及其制定的風險緩解策略的充分性，每季均會進行審查與報告。此框架同時採用自上而下的方法來管理組織層面風險，由各業務單位負責的資深主管主動識別可能對組織造成廣泛影響的風險，並提出相應的風險緩解措施。風險委員會將討論這些評估結果，並決定適當的後續行動。\n"}
{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n","zh":"# 可持續發展\n\n香港金融管理局現正發佈其首份可持續發展報告，作為《2021年年度報告》的重要組成部分，以闡述其在可持續發展方面的策略，並記錄自身努力以及與金融業界合作支持特區政府的氣候策略，為建設更具氣候韌性和可持續性的世界貢獻力量。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在履行主要職能時，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場推動者、負責任的投資者，還是維持金融及貨幣穩定，均將可持續發展融入考量之中。此外，金管局亦與本地及海外機構合作，加強對氣候風險的管理及資訊披露，並推動綠色及可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局致力履行企業社會責任，並力求成為負責任且可持續發展的組織。此承諾體現在多個方面，包括推動可持續、金融普惠及環保的市場，支持更廣泛的社會，保護環境，以及營造關懷的職場。\n\n# 概覽\n\n氣候變遷是當今世界面臨的最迫切挑戰之一。為應對氣候變遷，各國根據《巴黎協定》¹同意採取行動，減少溫室氣體（GHG）排放，並在本世紀內最終實現碳中和。 達成《巴黎協定》的氣候目標，預計全球每年將需要投資約1至2萬億美元，使可持續性成為未來數十年資本流動的主要驅動因素。\n\n香港致力於在綠色轉型中領先全球。政府已宣布將力爭於2050年前實現碳中和，與其他已發展經濟體同步。香港同時亦是亞洲首個承諾於2025年前，在相關行業遵循氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組（TCFD）的建議的管轄區。\n\n對金融業而言，氣候變遷既是風險，也是機會。雖然金融業無法迴避氣候變遷帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演關鍵角色，透過配置更多資金投入與降低溫室氣體排放及具備氣候韌性的發展相關的活動。\n\n香港金融管理局致力強化香港的金融體系，以支持更環保及可持續的未來，並推動相關行動，以達致政府的氣候目標，同時為全球議題作出貢獻。為實現此目標，金管局將可持續發展的考量融入其主要職能及日常運作之中。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力於提升銀行體系對氣候風險的韌性，並加速銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的進程。為此，金管局已制定監管框架，訂明銀行管理及披露氣候風險的監管要求。此外，金管局於2021年亦成功完成一項氣候風險壓力測試的試點，以評估銀行業的韌性。同時，金管局持續在監測金融穩定風險時納入氣候變化因素。\n\n其次，在市場發展方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正重點關注提升香港作為區域內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位，包括粵港澳大灣區（GBA）。作為內地離岸金融中心，香港具備優越條件，有助於將全球投資引導至內地，以支持其於2030年前實現碳達峰，並於2060年前實現碳中和的目標。香港金融管理局亦透過由其共同主持的綠色及可持續金融跨部門指導小組（CASG），致力於提升業界能力、彌補數據不足，並研究本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融解決方案方面居於領導地位，早在2019年便已推出全球首個政府中期票據計劃，專用於綠色債券發行，並於此後逐步擴展發行工具的多樣性，包括不同貨幣和期限。為支持私營機構發行綠色及可持續債券及貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色及可持續融資資助計劃。此計劃由香港金融管理局管理，已鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，並吸引更多綠色顧問及外部審核機構在此設立或擴展業務。\n\n第三，作為匯換基金的管理機構，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已確保環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素是其投資過程及資產配置決策的重要組成部分。在本報告的後段，香港金融管理局將首次披露匯換基金組合的氣候情景分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，香港金融管理局正積極加強自身的綠色辦公室措施，以確保其營運符合應對氣候風險的最佳實踐。作為初步，金管局已評估並確立其第一類和第二類溫室氣體排放範圍的碳足跡，並相應地進行披露。同時，金管局亦已實施多項措施，提升行業整體營運效率，並盡力減少資源消耗。此外，金管局秉持高標準的企業社會責任（CSR），並與各持份者合作，促進金融普及及提升金融素養。\n\n綠化金融系統需要中央銀行與監管機構的緊密合作。香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極參與國際事務，在全球政策制定及可持續發展標準的協調方面發揮關鍵作用。為支持《綠色金融系統中央銀行與監管機構網絡》（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言，金管局已發布聲明，重申致力落實NGFS建議，並採取必要措施，推動更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動可持續發展倡議，並評估與氣候相關的機會和風險時，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已將可持續發展因素融入其監管及風險管理框架。領導層積極參與，與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其轄下委員會商議，制定總體目標及指導原則。香港金融管理局的企業社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦會評估可持續發展及氣候相關議題對機構的潛在影響，並制定相應策略以減輕這些影響。相關策略和倡議的執行情況，將定期向高級管理層匯報，並接受密切監察。此外，金管局亦已聘請外部顧問，就特定範疇提供專業建議。\n\n本章後續各節將深入探討香港金融管理局在履行各項職能時，推動綠色金融及可持續發展工作的治理架構、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參照國際永續金融研討會（NGFS）於二零二一年十二月發布的《央行氣候相關披露指南》中建議的披露要素。此外，有關香港金融管理局辦公室營運的資訊，廣泛參考了全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準及香港交易所有限公司頒布的ESG報告指引。\n\n# 中央銀行與監管機構綠色金融系統網絡\n\nNGFS 提供一個平台，讓中央銀行與審慎監管機構得以交流經驗、分享最佳實踐，促進金融部門環境與氣候風險管理的發展，並動員主流金融資源支持向可持續經濟轉型。其旨在界定並推廣可在 NGFS 成員及非成員機構中實施的最佳實踐，並進行或委託有關綠色金融的分析研究。\n\n# 氣候相關財務披露工作小組\n\n2015年12月，金融穩定理事會（FSB）成立氣候相關財務資訊揭露工作小組（TCFD），旨在為企業向投資者、貸款機構及保險承保人提供更有效的氣候相關資訊披露建議，以促進更明智的決策。TCFD的建議圍繞四個主題領域，這些領域代表了組織運作的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理及指標與目標。\n\n# 銀行審核員\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應積極管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資金導向綠色及可持續活動。作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（HKMA）專注於增強銀行對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行在支持轉型至低碳經濟方面的努力。\n\n# 香港金融管理局三階段方案說明\n\n自2019年5月起，香港金融管理局已分三個階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業：\n\n# 第一期\n\n建立一套共同的評估框架，以衡量各銀行「綠色基線」水平，並與國際機構合作，為香港銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二期\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管預期與要求，聽取業界及其他利益相關者的意見。\n\n# 第三階段\n\n著重於監管要求的實施，並監測與評估銀行在綠色及可持續銀行業務方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理之監管要求\n\n2020年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）與業界合作，共同制定評估各銀行「綠色基線」的通用框架。金管局亦進行了首次銀行綠色評估，標誌第一階段的完成。為協助銀行準備新的監管要求，金管局於2020年6月發表了一篇白皮書，概述其對氣候風險管理監管期望的初步想法。\n\n2021年12月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於業界諮詢後，發布銀行監管要求，規定銀行須將氣候因素融入企業管治、策略、風險管理及資訊披露。為符合《氣候相關財務資訊披露建議》(TCFD) 的建議，該局已於2025年前訂定具體要求及時間表，以規範銀行進行相關資訊披露。此舉旨在為銀行提升風險管理能力訂定標準。\n\n香港金融管理局的下一步是監督銀行落實相關要求。為此，香港金融管理局已在銀行監管部門內設立新的專責團隊，以加強氣候風險監管。\n\n此三階段方法是一個反覆迭代的過程。繼2020年進行的綠色金融評估後，金管局正檢視框架，以納入有關氣候風險管理的最新監管要求，並可能擴展至涵蓋其他環境風險及支持淨零轉型的措施。金管局預計於2022年下半年推出更新後的框架。\n\n# 邁向碳中和的良好做法\n\n除了將氣候風險納入風險管理框架外，部分銀行已投入資源並採取措施，以支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並為實現全球淨零排放做出貢獻。香港金融管理局於2021年12月發布通函，與業界分享這些銀行的先進經驗，供業界其他銀行在制定氣候策略時參考。這些先進經驗主要涵蓋以下四個方面：減少銀行自身營運的溫室氣體排放，透過投資組合調整降低融資排放，協助客戶進行轉型，以及促進各方合作，協助經濟實現淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類架構以引導綠色金融流動\n\n為提高金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的一致制定，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正與其他金融監管機構合作，探討建立本地綠色分類框架，以連接國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）制定的《共同基礎分類法》(CGT)與中國及歐盟採納的綠色定義，並將此應用於不同金融領域。此項工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性為原則，同時考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地實際情況。此項倡議旨在降低綠色洗白風險，提升產品的可比性，並最終增強投資者保護。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險情境分析\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化所帶來的潛在衝擊的能力，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試點。此試點共有20間主要零售銀行及七間國際銀行集團的分行參與。2021年12月，公佈了總結試點結果的報告。報告顯示，即使面對極端的氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍具備韌性，但這些衝擊可能對銀行財務狀況造成顯著影響。此壓力測試有助於提升銀行評估及管理氣候風險的能力。基於試點結果，參與銀行已制定計劃，以加強其氣候策略及風險管理架構。香港金融管理局將持續與業界合作，提升銀行相關能力，並完善壓力測試框架，同時參考試點過程中的經驗。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit\n","zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n審計局長關於交換基金財務報表的報告\n\n# 審計署\n香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司長\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人謹此聲明，我已審計聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「集團」）所載於第217至319頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括截至2021年12月31日的聯匯基金及集團的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支表、綜合損益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註，其中包含重要會計政策概要。\n\n根據我的意見，財務報表真實且公允地反映了截至2021年12月31日止基金及集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，且已依照《儲備基金條例》（第66章）第7條所發出的行政長官指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見根據\n\n我已按照行政長官根據《金融管理局條例》第七條發出的指示，以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據該等準則，我的職責在我的報告中「審計師對審計財務報表的責任」一節中進一步闡述。我已按照該等準則保持獨立於本集團，並已履行其他道德職責。我相信我所取得的審計證據已足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計重點\n\n關鍵審計事項是指於截至2021年12月31日止年度，我根據專業判斷認為最為重要的審計事項。這些事項是在我審計整體財務報表時所考量，並作為我形成審計意見的依據，我並未就此提供獨立意見。\n\n# 評估金融資產及金融負債之公允價值\n\n請參閱財務報表 附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為港幣4,502,475億元，金融負債總額為港幣1,150,861億元，均按公允價值計算。\n\n這些金融資產和金融負債中，89% 的公允價值為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（層級1輸入），其餘則為基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術估算（層級2輸入）。\n\n對於此類金融資產中剩餘的11%，其公允價值乃使用未依賴可觀察市場數據的估值技術（第三層輸入）進行估計。此類金融資產總計港幣5173.16億元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於實質性金額及涉及估計，金融資產及金融負債之公允價值評估為關鍵審計事項。\n\n財務資產及金融負債之公允價值評估，審計程序包括：\n\n取得對不同類別金融資產及金融負債之評估程序，包括相關控制措施的了解；\n評估及測試相關控制措施，包括電腦系統的應用控制；\n就金融資產及金融負債的評估、存在性、權利義務及完整性，取得外部確認；\n若使用公開市場價格，則核實該價格是否來自獨立來源；\n若使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的評估技術，則評估評估方法之適當性及假設之合理性，並核實輸入數據是否來自獨立來源；\n若使用以不可觀察市場數據為基礎的評估技術，則評估評估方法之適當性及假設與輸入數據之合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產按公允價值進行評估\n\n請參閱財務報表，附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公允價值列賬，截至2021年12月31日總額為港幣27,089億元。集團同時在一家聯營公司及二十一家合營企業中擁有權益，總額為港幣45,172億元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由集團直接持有，或由聯營公司或合營企業持有，均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。此等估值涉及重大的判斷和估計，包括估值方法及所用假設。\n\n關於投資性不動產公允價值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱本集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值符合該等估值報告所載的估值；\n評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；以及\n評估估值方法之適當性，以及假設及輸入之合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資料。此資料包括香港金融管理局2021年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及核數師報告。\n\n我的意見僅限於財務報表，不對其他資訊提供任何形式的保證。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估這些資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大錯誤，或在其他方面存在重大偏差。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為這些資訊存在重大錯誤，我必須報告此事實。在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金管局及外匯基金審計委員會財務報表職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，編製真實且公允的財務報表，並建立其認為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤陳述所必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營能力，披露與持續經營相關的事項（如適用），並採用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n香港儲備基金諮詢委員會的審計小組負責監察其財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表的審核責任\n\n我的目標是就財務報表整體而言，取得對財務報表是否包含重大偏差的合理保證，無論此偏差是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水準的保證，但並非絕對的保障；即使按照審計準則進行的審計，也可能無法發現已存在的重大偏差。此類偏差可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若單獨或總計起來，合理預期會影響財務報表使用者所做的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為審計署審計準則的遵照審計一部分，我會行使專業判斷，並在審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。 並且：\n\n識別及評估財務報表存在重大錯報的風險，不論該風險源自舞弊或錯誤，設計並執行針對該等風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我提出意見的依據。未能察覺因舞弊導致的重大錯報風險，高於因錯誤導致的風險，因為舞弊可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制等行為；\n了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計符合實際情況的審計程序，但此了解並非用於對集團內部控制有效性發表意見；\n評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n對貨幣當局採用延續經營假設作為會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，則必須在審計報告中指出財務報表中相關的披露，若該等披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n評估財務報表整體的呈列、結構及內容，包括披露內容，並判斷財務報表是否以達成公允呈列的方式，反映其底層交易及事項；\n取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表財務報表意見。我對集團審計的指揮、監督及執行負有責任。我對審計意見負全責。\n\n我與匯換基金諮詢委員會的審計小組就審計範圍、時間安排及重大審計發現進行溝通，當中包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向交易所基金諮詢委員會審計委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向其通報所有可能被認為攸關我獨立性的關係及其他事項，如適用時，亦會說明相關保障。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組與我溝通的事項中，我確定本期財務報表審計中最具顯著性的事項，並將其視為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露相關事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項可能產生的不利影響將合理地超過公開披露所能帶來的公共利益，否則我會在審計報告中說明這些事項。\n\n約翰朱 審計部門主管\n"}
