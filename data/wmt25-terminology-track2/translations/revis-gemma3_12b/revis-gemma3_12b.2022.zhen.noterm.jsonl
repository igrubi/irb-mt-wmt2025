{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 內地機遇\n","en":"2022 was a year of resilience.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus continued to disrupt global economic growth and fuel rising inflation. Subsequently, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine further intensified inflationary pressures, prompting major central banks to adopt tighter monetary policies, which increased volatility in global financial markets and heightened the risk of an economic slowdown. Locally, a fifth wave of the pandemic led to a rapid increase in infections, further impacting the economy. Simultaneously, negative reports surrounding COVID-19 restrictions created a perception of Hong Kong abroad, threatening its reputation as an international financial center. For the year, Hong Kong's real Gross Domestic Product contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to ensure Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, implementing key measures to reinforce its position as a leading international financial center. Following three years of travel restrictions, we have successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully reopened, welcoming visitors to experience the city once again. Last November, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" attracting financial leaders from around the world. The enthusiastic response from the international community is a clear indication of Hong Kong’s full recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainty. Nevertheless, the resumption of economic activity on the Mainland will boost Hong Kong and the wider region. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to steadfastly fulfill its role in maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems, and will actively seek opportunities to benefit Hong Kong’s development and enhance its competitiveness as an international financial centre. We will also continue to contribute to global climate resilience and sustainable development. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report this year, we will publish a separate 2022 Sustainability Report to provide a more detailed account of the HKMA’s work in enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as our efforts as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Resilient and Steadfast as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System, implemented in 1983, has successfully weathered numerous economic cycles and absorbed various external shocks. In 2022, the system once again demonstrated its resilience. Amidst significant monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, the Hong Kong dollar’s exchange rate was defended 41 times between May and November 2022, triggering the system’s mechanism to ensure it remained within its permitted trading band. During this period, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion from the market, as per the established protocol. Throughout this time, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money market continued to operate smoothly, reflecting the stability and effectiveness of the arrangement.\n\nThe confidence in the linked exchange rate system stems from its solid foundation built over many years. As reaffirmed by the International Monetary Fund in its \"2022 External Sector Report,\" the credibility of the linked exchange rate system is based on several factors, including transparent operating rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, prudent fiscal policies, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to robust mechanisms, actively communicating with the public and the market to enhance their understanding of the linked exchange rate system, conducting effective market surveillance, and developing contingency plans for different scenarios all contribute to reinforcing confidence in the system across various sectors. Our social media promotional campaign launched to explain the operational mechanisms of the linked exchange rate system effectively maintained market confidence despite the weak-side exchange guarantee being triggered multiple times this year. Internally, the HKMA also utilizes data analytics technology to strengthen market surveillance, enabling us to respond promptly to the latest market developments.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained stable throughout the year, maintaining ample capital and liquidity despite facing macroeconomic challenges and rising credit risks. At the end of 2022, the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.1%, significantly above the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks slightly increased to 162.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenging credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system deteriorated slightly, with the classified loan ratio rising to 1.38% by the end of 2022. However, this level remained sound and was still below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Effective Regulation Ensures Banking System Health.\n\nThe pandemic has persisted for three years, exacerbating challenges stemming from heightened geopolitical tensions and tightening monetary policies by major central banks. However, thanks to years of prudent risk management and effective regulation, Hong Kong’s banking system has remained resilient and continues to play a crucial role in supporting the economy.\n\nBanks continued to provide necessary support to customers while maintaining sound credit risk management amid economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of the pandemic. The pre-approved interest-only payment plan with deferred principal was further extended, and now includes a voluntary option for borrowers to begin repaying part of the principal, helping customers prepare for resuming normal repayments.\n\nIn response to increased market volatility caused by significant tightening of monetary policies by major economies, a key regulatory focus for the HKMA in 2022 was to strengthen the supervision of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures. We conducted in-depth assessments of the potential impact of synchronized monetary tightening across economies on banks, and introduced new scenarios for stress testing to evaluate banks’ resilience to prolonged liquidity pressures.\n\nWe continue to implement proactive measures to strengthen risk management across multiple areas. To enhance operational resilience and digital defense capabilities, we provide guidance to banks in establishing comprehensive operational frameworks to ensure stable and effective operations. This includes detailed regulatory guidance for specific operational areas, such as addressing the use of cloud computing as digitalization expands. Furthermore, in response to the accelerating pace of digitalization, we have reinforced our efforts to combat phishing scams and protect consumers and investors.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA’s call to provide basic banking services, with some establishing new branches and self-service banking facilities in new development areas, particularly in large public housing estates. Due to pandemic-related travel restrictions, many Hong Kong residents have been unable to use their mainland bank accounts. To address this, the HKMA has closely collaborated with relevant parties to reopen approximately 500,000 mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to do so without traveling to the mainland.\n\nThe continued development of Hong Kong's banking sector hinges on strengthening professional expertise. As banks grow, the demand for skilled professionals remains high. Building on its \"Connecting Talent with the Future\" talent development strategy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced several initiatives over the past year to attract, develop, and retain talent within the industry. These initiatives focus on upgrading the skills of existing employees and nurturing the next generation to build a robust talent pipeline.\n\n# International Financial Center: Hong Kong Reclaims Its Global Stage.\n\nHong Kong has worked diligently to return to the global stage since the gradual lifting of pandemic-related travel restrictions in 2022. The “International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit,” held in November, drew over 200 senior executives from leading global financial institutions, attracting considerable international attention and enthusiastic responses. Despite coinciding with the first November typhoon signal in half a century, the summit was a resounding success, demonstrating to the world that Hong Kong has fully rebounded and is brimming with renewed energy and opportunity. We are encouraged to see the summit’s positive impact, with numerous global financial institutions and international organizations now hosting or planning events in Hong Kong.\n\nBeyond attracting visitors to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and I recognize the importance of face-to-face communication. Therefore, I strive to represent Hong Kong in person at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and use overseas trips as opportunities to meet with the management teams of global financial institutions to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and the opportunities offered under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center, we are actively developing new opportunities in strategic areas such as financial technology, leveraging opportunities in the Mainland, and advancing green and sustainable finance. We are also strengthening Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem to provide leading services and attract more businesses to Hong Kong. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the “2022 Sustainability Report.”\n\n# Financial Technology\n\nIn 2022, we made significant progress across all five areas following the release of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021.\n\nHong Kong banks have made significant progress in their digital transformation. According to a recent assessment of fintech adoption, the banking sector has widely embraced fintech across various business areas, with the range of technologies used consistently expanding. Since 2017, our efforts to support and drive forward digitalization have been well-received by banks and continue to deliver positive outcomes. We will continue to collaborate closely with the industry, leveraging the assessment results to further promote fintech applications in specific banking areas and to encourage the development of individual technology categories.\n\nThis year, we have made significant progress in our work on central bank digital currencies. The “Multi-Border Framework for Interlinking Payment Systems” (mBridge) project has entered a pilot phase and is among the first globally to facilitate real-time settlement for cross-border corporate transactions using central bank digital currencies. At the retail level, technical testing of cross-border use of the digital yuan has entered its second phase, primarily testing the recharge of digital yuan wallets via the Faster Payment System. Regarding the digital Hong Kong dollar, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for its future issuance and launch a pilot program for the second track, inviting industry participants to explore viable application scenarios.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of financial technology. Our “Commercial Data Platform,” launched in October last year, is an important step in enhancing Hong Kong’s data infrastructure. As a shared data infrastructure based on data owner authorization, the “Commercial Data Platform” enables financial institutions to access business data, making it easier for companies, particularly SMEs, to obtain financing. As of the end of 2022, the “Commercial Data Platform” helped secure over 1,000 SME loans, totaling over HKD 1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we recognize the need to monitor and manage the associated risks. We are closely observing developments in the virtual asset sector and participating in international discussions on related regulatory matters. After considering public consultation feedback and relevant international standards, we will apply the principle of “same risk, same regulation” to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins and define its scope. Our initial focus will be on stablecoins pegged to the value of one or more fiat currencies, as these pose the most immediate risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that with appropriate regulations, the industry can safely and securely explore the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector are actively preparing for this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully realize the potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\n# Mainland Prospects\n"}

The labor market initially weakened but gradually improved, while inflation remained moderate. With the resumption of travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong, economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system remained sound in 2022, with ample capital and liquidity, and asset quality maintained a healthy level.\n\n# Financial Stability\n\nAs the United States tightened its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened, triggering the linked exchange rate system multiple times during the year. However, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly and in an orderly manner, repeatedly demonstrating the system’s stability and effectiveness.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. The Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -4.5%, a modest loss compared to the performance of most diversified asset funds in the market.\n\nThe HKMA continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The long-term growth portfolio has generated an annualized return of 12.6% since 2009.\n\n# Banking System Stable\n\nIn response to expanding volatility in financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened its oversight of banks' credit and market risk management, and is working closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, in order to address the increasing cyber threats and the accelerated digital transformation of the banking sector.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has further introduced consumer protection measures concerning “buy now, pay later” products and arrangements for refinancing mortgages. In addition, the HKMA has collaborated with other regulatory bodies to develop a regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued guidelines on the distribution of investment products, and launched a new regulatory regime for trust business. A credit data platform under the “multiple credit reference agencies” model for personal credit data will also be operational this year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with banks to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, strengthening measures to address fraud and accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology in its AML efforts. Through a series of RegTech Labs, the HKMA is also promoting the application of data and technology to enhance its anti-money laundering framework.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including those relating to capital adequacy and disclosure, locally. It is also working with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance the skills of its workforce.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority developed new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources for systemically important banks operating in Hong Kong, marking an important milestone in the development of the resolution framework.\n\n# Hong Kong: A Global Financial Hub\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit was a success, strengthening Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub and generating positive impacts.\n\nThe currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was enhanced this year, further solidifying Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also collaborating with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of Swap Connect and to introduce a mechanism supporting RMB-denominated stock trading in Hong Kong through dual market makers.

{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","en":"# 2023 Priorities and Outlook\n\nDespite signs of economic recovery in early 2023, Hong Kong’s economy faces a challenging and uncertain global environment. Recent pressures on the banking sectors in the United States and Europe, including the collapse of several U.S. banks in March 2023, have sent ripples through global financial markets. Furthermore, tightening monetary policies by major central banks could significantly slow global economic growth. Geopolitical tensions and the ongoing threat of deglobalization may also continue to weigh on global trade and cause market volatility. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system, built on years of robust resilience and substantial reserves, is well-positioned to weather these challenges.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority places great importance on safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, promptly identifying emerging risks and responding flexibly. Simultaneously, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre. In a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to prudently manage the Exchange Fund, maintaining the flexibility to implement protective measures as required and ensuring high liquidity.\n\n# The financial system is stable and robust.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will closely monitor the latest developments, heighten vigilance, and guard against various potential risks to maintain a stable and sound financial system. This is a prerequisite for the continued provision of essential financial services and, therefore, the lifeline for Hong Kong’s normal economic operation.\n\n# Stay vigilant to potential risks.\n\nIn 2023, uncertainty surrounding U.S. interest rate movements and pressures within the banking systems of advanced economies may pose risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Furthermore, ongoing geopolitical risks could continue to weigh on global trade and lead to volatility in global financial markets. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, strengthened by the resilience and buffers built up over the years, is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in both the local and external environments and will take appropriate measures as necessary to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. The HKMA will also study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with them.\n\n# Maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nGiven the escalating geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. On the other hand, rapid technological advancements and digitalization present both opportunities and risks for the banking industry. In the face of a rapidly evolving financial landscape, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to ensuring banks have sufficient resilience to withstand shocks through ongoing supervision. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine the banking regulatory framework and policies by referencing international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Priorities\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions, with a focus on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of borrowers with weaker financial conditions. The HKMA will also strengthen its supervisory system and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level of the banking system remains under control.\n\nOn the other hand, the HKMA will continue to monitor the operating environment of businesses and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the eventual withdrawal from the \"interest-only repayment plan,\" while ensuring that customers facing temporary difficulties continue to receive appropriate credit support.\n\nIn response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will strengthen its oversight of authorized institutions' liquidity and market risk management in 2023.\n\n# Business and Technology Risks\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their business operations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to enhancing the operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities of the banking sector. Following the release of a new section on “Operational Resilience” in the Regulatory Policy Manual in May, the HKMA will maintain close communication with authorized institutions to review their progress in establishing operational resilience frameworks. Simultaneously, the HKMA will strengthen the banking sector’s cybersecurity capabilities by addressing issues identified under the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0” and reviewing the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust triple data backups.\n\nAs digitalization accelerates, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's other regulatory priorities include strengthening oversight of banks’ third-party service providers’ risk management and enhancing data governance capabilities within the banking sector.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will focus on updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and promoting the development of regulatory technology (RegTech) and compliance technology in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing efforts. The HKMA will also revise its Guidelines on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, issuing specific guidance on risk-proportionate measures for politically exposed persons to facilitate the industry’s effective and risk-based implementation of key legislative amendments.\nConcurrently, the HKMA will expand existing public-private partnerships to enhance information sharing and support the launch of an information-sharing platform among banks, accelerating the detection of suspicious accounts and preventing account misuse. This will also strengthen protection for victims of fraud and assist them in recovering losses.\nThe HKMA will further promote the adoption of compliance technology, including data analytics, through the AML\/CTF RegTech Lab and related initiatives, striving to develop advanced analytical capabilities to support its data-driven regulatory oversight. Through these measures, the HKMA will be better positioned to swiftly address systemic money laundering risks, such as nominee account networks, and to flexibly respond to evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Services\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strengthen on-site inspections and off-site supervision of authorized institutions regarding their conduct in wealth management, as well as the sale of securities, the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), and other investment and insurance products in 2023. Key areas of focus will include the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. The HKMA will consider the latest market developments and revisions to international standards throughout this process.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will work closely with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, providing guidance to licensed firms on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products, including those related to virtual assets. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulators to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework.\n\nWith the smooth launch of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will liaise with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to optimize the program. In addition, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales procedures for investment products, including those applicable to sophisticated investors, and will begin regulating the trust business of authorized institutions in accordance with the new sections and operational guidelines in the relevant Regulatory Policy Manual.\n\n# Financial Market Infrastructure Oversight\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority aims to promote the safety and efficiency of financial market infrastructures under its supervision, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (the “PFMI”), and the guidelines issued by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee. The Authority assesses these infrastructures as needed, referencing the latest international standards. It participates in monitoring and evaluation programs conducted by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions regarding the implementation of the PFMI, and engages in the work of international standard-setting organizations. The Authority also strengthens its oversight by adapting to market and technological developments and, where necessary, collaborates with relevant authorities to enhance supervisory cooperation.\n\n# Developing Policy\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to strengthen and refine the banking regulatory framework and policies in line with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital Standards\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further optimize its capital framework by implementing standards issued in recent years by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, including:\n- The revised capital standards outlined in the December 2017 “Basel III: Finalizing Post-Crisis Reforms,” the January 2019 (revised in February 2019) “Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk,” and the July 2020 “Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework” – collectively known as the Basel III final reforms. These reforms detail new regulatory approaches to credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, and introduce an output floor, as well as optimize the leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to launch a public consultation in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (“Capital Rules”) to implement these provisions and the countercyclical capital buffer. These amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny within the same year and will take effect no earlier than January 1, 2024, as minimum requirements.\n- The December 2022 “Prudential Treatment of Crypto-Asset Exposures.” The HKMA plans to implement these standards locally on January 1, 2025, in line with the Basel Committee’s timeline, and intends to consult with the industry on related proposals in 2023.\n\n# Risk Capacity\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulted the industry in March 2023 regarding proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital Adequacy Rules). These amendments primarily respond to the HKMA’s implementation of revised capital standards under the final Basel III reforms. The consultation document also includes related revisions to the handling of concentrated risk from government-related entities under the Capital Rules. The target implementation date for the revised rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk component under the revised Capital Rules related to the final Basel III reforms (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standards\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to consult the industry in 2023 regarding amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules, introduced through the 2023 Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules (the “2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules”). These amendments are being made to coincide with proposed changes to the Capital Rules. Consequently, the target implementation date for the 2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk provisions in the revised Capital Rules under the final reforms of Basel III (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Reporting Standards\n\nThe final reform package of Basel III includes new and revised disclosure requirements related to revised capital standards, primarily detailed in the Basel Committee’s “Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework” (issued in December 2018) and “Revised Market Risk Disclosure Requirements” (issued in November 2021). The Basel Committee also issued “Revised Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements” in June 2019 to address concerns about potential “window dressing”—the practice of banks reducing transaction volumes around reporting dates to artificially inflate reported leverage ratios. To implement these requirements in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing corresponding amendments to the “Banking (Disclosure) Rules” (the “Disclosure Rules”), along with revised standard disclosure templates and forms, and is consulting with the industry in the process.

Therefore, it has consistently strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to sound institutional governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n- Has established a clear and highly accountable institutional governance framework;\n- Has implemented comprehensive and robust monitoring measures to manage risks and ensure that the conduct of all staff complies with specified standards; and\n- Maintains a policy of transparency and openness, maintaining close engagement with stakeholders.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (the Government), but it can appoint staff under terms of employment different from those of civil servants to attract personnel with appropriate experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officials. The HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations within the legal authority delegated to the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary stated that monetary stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately HK$7.80 per US dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for independently achieving these monetary policy objectives, including deciding on relevant strategies, tools, and implementation methods, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and preserving its status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Financial Regulator’s duties include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system;\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;\n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing, and settlement systems, and operating such systems where appropriate; and\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Manager is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n#AccountabilityAndTransparency\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations and in implementing government policy objectives, alongside strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to maintaining monetary and banking stability, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and supervising a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and fostering economic development in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must earn public trust to effectively carry out its duties. Therefore, the HKMA is committed to transparently explaining its policies and operations, and promptly addresses issues of public concern within its mandate. In particular, the HKMA clarifies misinformation and rumors regarding its policies through traditional and social media channels.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is appointed by the Financial Secretary and is therefore accountable to the public. The HKMA also derives its authority from laws passed by the Legislative Council, ensuring its accountability to the public through that body. The HKMA recognizes a broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor matters of public concern. In its daily operations and engagement with the community, the HKMA is committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA's work, while respecting legal restrictions on the disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data; and\n- To remain attuned to public opinion and respond appropriately to public views.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to engaging with the media, the HKMA publishes a variety of bilingual journals and special publications. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features sections covering economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an Information Centre, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week. Details regarding the HKMA’s functions can be found in the “Institutional Functions” chapter (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has steadily increased the frequency and detail of its publications regarding the Exchange Fund and Currency Board accounts. The HKMA began participating in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for central banks in 1999. It also publishes minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has featured banking sector supervisory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the Legislative Council’s Financial Affairs Committee three times a year on the HKMA's operations and policies, and to answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives regularly attend Legislative Council committee meetings and sub-committee meetings to elaborate on and discuss specific issues, as well as assist legislators in scrutinizing draft legislation.\n\n# Monitoring Measures\n\n<think>\nLet's analyze the junior translators' attempts. All six translations capture the core meaning of the original text, which is commendable. However, there are nuances and stylistic choices where improvements can be made.\n**Common Strengths:** Most translations correctly identify \"金管局\" as \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (or its abbreviation HKMA). They also accurately translate \"穩健有效的\" as \"robust and effective\" or similar phrasing. The concepts of \"員工操守,\" \"審慎的風險管理,\" and \"適當的制衡\" are generally well-handled as \"employee conduct\/integrity,\" \"prudent risk management,\" and \"checks and balances.\"\n**Weaknesses and Specific Comments:**\n*   **\"金管局\" vs. \"Financial Supervisory Commission\":** Translator #3 incorrectly translates \"金管局\" as \"Financial Supervisory Commission.\" This is a significant error; 金管局 specifically refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n*   **Word Choice & Flow:** While \"robust and effective\" is accurate, it can feel slightly repetitive. Some translations use \"sound and effective\" (Translator #4), which is a good alternative. \"Employ\" is used frequently, which can make the language feel a bit stiff.\n*   **\"秉持\" vs. \"Ensure\/Maintain\/Adherence\":** The verb \"秉持\" implies upholding or adhering to a standard. While \"ensure\" is acceptable, \"adherence to\" (Translator #6) or simply \"to\" (implied in other versions) is more natural in this context. \"Maintain\" (Translator #2) is slightly less fitting.\n*   **\"足夠及具成效\" vs. \"sufficient and effective\/adequate and effective\":** These are all acceptable, but \"adequate and effective\" is slightly more formal and aligns better with the tone of a regulatory document.\n*   **\"內部及外部審計職能\" vs. \"Internal and external audit functions\/Both internal and external audit functions\":** Adding \"Both\" (Translator #5) is redundant. \"Internal and external audit functions\" is concise and clear.\n*   **Prepositions:** Translator #4 uses \"on whether,\" which is grammatically awkward. \"Whether\" should stand alone.\n*   **Overall Tone:** The original text has a formal, professional tone. Some translations lean slightly towards being overly conversational.\n**Potential Improvements & Best Approach:**\nThe best translation should be accurate, fluent, and maintain the formal tone of the original. I would prioritize clarity and conciseness. Replacing \"employ\" with a more varied vocabulary would improve flow. Using \"adequate and effective\" for \"足夠及具成效\" would enhance the formality.  The most accurate rendering of 金管局 is crucial.\nConsidering all these points, a refined translation would aim for something along the lines of: \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure adherence to high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms.\"<\/end>\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure adherence to high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees’ ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the conduct of all employees at every level complies with established standards.\n\n# Internal Oversight\n\n# System Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches have a responsibility to assess the risks within their workflows and establish appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the stable and reliable operation of the HKMA.\n\n# Organizational Risk Management\n\nRisk management also operates at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Governor of the Monetary Authority, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee evaluates potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, assessing the sufficiency of related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Auditing\n\nThe Internal Audit Department of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority independently assesses whether the governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments are sufficient and effective, and recommends improvements.\n\n# Independent Audit\n\nUnder Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Audit Department does not charge fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對第五波新冠病毒疫情、金融狀況收緊及充滿挑戰的外圍環境，香港經濟在2022年顯著收縮。勞工市場持續一段時間轉差，其後逐步改善，而通脹則維持溫和。資產市場亦有所受壓。受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預計2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受本地及外圍環境各項不利因素拖累，香港經濟在2022年收縮3.5%（表1及圖1）。本地方面，由於香港爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情，私人消費在第1季急跌，其後受惠於社交距離措施逐步放寬及政府消費券計劃的刺激，私人消費再度錄得按季增長。在營商氣氛疲弱及金融狀況收緊下，整體投資支出較2021年顯著下跌。對外方面，隨着外部需求轉弱，加上內地與香港之間的跨境陸路貨運受阻，香港貨物出口下挫。服務輸出依然大致疲弱，部分反映訪港旅遊活動低迷，但其後隨着政府於9月下旬撤銷抵港強制檢疫要求，情況於第4季稍為改善。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n本地通脹壓力於2022年稍升，但仍屬溫和。具體而言，按年基本通脹率逐步上升至12月2%的溫和水平，其中外圍能源及食品價格高企的影響部分被溫和的本地成本壓力所抵銷，尤其是偏軟的房屋租金（圖2）。此外，在經濟活動疲弱下，名義工資增長及商業樓宇租金持續偏軟，亦有助遏抑通脹。2022年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及1.9%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n疫情下勞工市場狀況在2022年初急速惡化，但隨後持續改善。失業率在4月升至5.4%的高位後，於12月顯著回落至3.5%（圖3），當中大多數行業的失業率均有所下降。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺回升，反映整體勞工需求逐步回復，惟總就業人數仍低於疫情前水平。名義工資和勞工收入的按年升幅亦略為加快。另一方面，與去年同期比較，勞動人口於12月略為減少1.5%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率輕微下跌。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處及金管局職員估計數字\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市在2022年出現大幅波動。承接2021年的下行趨勢，恒生指數加速下跌，在2022年10月31日收報14,687點，是自2009年以來的最低水平（圖4）。股市顯著調整，最初是由市場對本地新冠病毒疫情、美國加息及俄烏局勢的憂慮加劇所觸發，其後由於環球金融狀況收緊及內地新冠病毒疫情導致環球經濟前景轉差，令股市調整幅度進一步擴大。股市在年內最後兩個月重拾一些上升動力，部分受到內地優化防疫抗疫措施所支持。恒生指數於年底收報19,781點，較2021年底顯著下跌15.5%，連續第三年下挫。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n在金融狀況收緊及經濟活動疲弱下，住宅物業市場亦有所受壓。樓價於2022年回落15%（圖4），成交量也大幅縮減39%至45,050宗，創下有紀錄以來的新低。儘管樓價下跌，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊。實際按揭利率於年內由約1.6厘上升至3.375至3.625厘，增加供樓人士的按揭供款負擔。非住宅物業市場亦進一步回軟。在空置率高企下，其價格有所回落，租金亦維持偏軟。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預期2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。儘管先進經濟體增長預期放緩將繼續拖累香港貨物出口，但內地經濟復甦及跨境陸路貨運限制撤銷，應能為本港經濟提供支持。內地與香港全面通關亦有望令香港入境旅遊及其他服務輸出顯著受惠，並提振本地營商氣氛及資本開支。私人消費亦將會在勞工市場轉強下進一步改善。政府預測2023年全年實質本地生產總值會顯著增長，介乎3.5至5.5%。然而，香港經濟增長前景仍受眾多風險及不明朗因素所影響，並很大程度上取決於美國聯邦儲備局政策利率走勢、全球增長前景、地緣政治局勢持續緊張以及本地入境旅遊的復甦步伐。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n展望未來，預期本地通脹將輕微上升，但在各種因素互相抵銷下應保持溫和。儘管外圍價格應會維持高企，但由於部分主要經濟體的經濟活動轉弱及商品價格上行壓力緩和，外圍價格的上升動力或會進一步減弱。同樣地，隨着本地經濟復甦及勞工市場改善，本地成本壓力或會輕微上升，但房屋租金偏軟應繼續在一定程度上抵銷其影響。政府預測2023年全年合計的整體及基本通脹率分別為2.9%及2.5%。另一方面，勞工市場狀況有望隨着本地經濟活動復常而進一步改善。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2022年面對充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，包括年初爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫，以及全球各大央行大幅度加息應對通脹上升等。面對各項挑戰，香港銀行應付裕如，資本及流動性狀況繼續保持充裕。年內銀行體系面對的信貸風險增加，但整體資產質素維持於健康水平。與此同時，利率上升促使銀行淨利息收入增加，但其正面影響因呆壞帳準備金增加及費用與佣金收入減少而被局部抵銷。整體而言，零售銀行盈利較2021年改善。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2021年底的0.89%上升至2022年底的1.38%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.56%升至0.85%（圖5）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為2.21%，亦較2021年底的0.89%上升。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是由於部分內地房地產發展商的貸款評級被下調。儘管如此，銀行撥備充足，截至2022年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約維持於80%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約140%。另一方面，2022年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.06%及0.23%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的資產質素\n註：數字涵蓋香港辦事處、境外分行及境外主要附屬公司。\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n銀行體系在2022年繼續錄得盈利。年內零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利上升19.0%（圖7）。盈利改善是受惠於淨利息收入（+34%）及外匯與衍生工具收入增加（+72%），但部分升幅被呆壞帳準備金增加（+151%）及費用與佣金收入減少（–19%）所抵銷。在加息環境下，淨息差由上一年的0.98%擴闊至2022年的1.31%（圖8）。年內市場波動增加，亦令銀行來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入增加。呆壞帳準備金增加是由於須為新的特定分類貸款預留特殊準備金，而在金融市場表現疲弱下，費用及佣金收入減少。零售銀行成本與收入比率由2021年的54.7%，降至2022年的48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2022年銀行體系資產負債表擴大2.5%。資產上升是由於外匯及衍生工具持倉按市價計值增加。面對外圍不明朗因素及利率趨升，年內貸款需求減弱。相比2021年錄得3.8%的增幅，2022年貸款總額減少3.0%。其中在香港境外使用的貸款減少10.2%，貿易融資減少13.5%，在香港使用的貸款則稍增0.9%。中國內地相關貸款繼2021年增長3.7%後，於2022年減少4.4%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，銀行體系存款繼續錄得溫和增長。存款總額於2022年增加1.7%，相比2021年的增幅為4.6%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2021年底的71.8%稍降至2022年底的68.5%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行在2022年的資本狀況維持充裕。2022年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為20.1%，相比上一年為20.2%；一級資本比率為18.1%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2022年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況繼續維持穩健，成為在宏觀經濟環境不明朗因素加劇下的重要支柱。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2022年第4季為162.3%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為63.2%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2022年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為137.7%及155.7%（圖14）。以上所有4個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖14 指定認可機構的資金比率\n資料來源：金管局\n","en":"# Economy and Finance\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted significantly in 2022, facing the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, tighter financial conditions, and a challenging external environment. The labor market initially weakened before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also experienced pressure. With the full resumption of travel between Mainland China and Hong Kong, the Hong Kong economy is expected to rebound from a low level in 2023.\n\n# Economic Performance Review\n\n# Physical Economy Activities\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, due to a range of adverse factors both locally and externally (Table 1 and Figure 1). Locally, private consumption declined sharply in the first quarter as a result of the fifth wave of COVID-19. It subsequently recovered, supported by the gradual easing of social distancing measures and the government’s consumption voucher scheme. Overall investment spending decreased significantly compared to 2021, reflecting a weak business climate and tighter financial conditions. Externally, Hong Kong’s merchandise exports fell as external demand weakened and cross-border land transport between mainland China and Hong Kong was disrupted. Service exports remained sluggish, largely because tourism was subdued, but improved somewhat in the fourth quarter after the government lifted mandatory quarantine requirements for arrivals in late September.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution to Real GDP Growth by Component\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Category\nNote: Quarterly data for seasonally adjusted local fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n#inflation\n\nLocal inflation pressures rose slightly in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the core inflation rate gradually increased to 2% by December, partially offset by mild local cost pressures, particularly soft housing rents (Figure 2). The weak economic climate also contributed to subdued wage growth and lower commercial property rents, further limiting inflationary pressures. For the full year of 2022, core and overall inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market deteriorated sharply in early 2022 but subsequently improved. The unemployment rate peaked at 5.4% in April before declining significantly to 3.5% by December (Figure 3), with unemployment rates falling across most industries. Total employment and private sector job vacancies rebounded, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, though employment remains below pre-pandemic levels. Annual growth rates of nominal wages and labor income also accelerated slightly.  Meanwhile, the labor force decreased by 1.5% in December compared to the same period last year, partly due to a slight decline in labor force participation.\n\nFigure 2 Basic Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Government Statistics Department and Hong Kong Monetary Authority staff estimates.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong's stock market experienced significant swings in 2022. Continuing the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, reaching 14,687 points on October 31, 2022—its lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The market’s downturn was initially driven by concerns over local COVID-19 conditions, rising U.S. interest rates, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Subsequently, tighter global financial conditions and the impact of COVID-19 in mainland China further dampened the global economic outlook. In the final two months of the year, the market showed signs of recovery, partly supported by mainland China’s optimized pandemic prevention measures. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 19,781 points, a 15.5% decrease from the end of 2021, marking the third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nThe residential property market also came under pressure amid tightening financial conditions and a weak economy. Property prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), and transaction volumes decreased sharply by 39% to 45,050 units, reaching a record low. Despite the price decline, affordability remained tight. Mortgage interest rates rose during the year from approximately 1.6% to a range of 3.375% to 3.625%, increasing the burden of mortgage payments for homeowners. The non-residential property market also softened further. High vacancy rates led to price declines and weak rental rates.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\nData Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic climate\n\nHong Kong’s economy is expected to rebound from a low base in 2023, benefiting from the mainland and Hong Kong border reopening. While slower growth in advanced economies will continue to affect Hong Kong’s merchandise exports, the mainland’s economic recovery and the lifting of restrictions on cross-border land cargo transport are expected to provide support. The reopening is also anticipated to significantly boost Hong Kong’s inbound tourism and other service exports, as well as bolster local business confidence and capital expenditure. Private consumption is also projected to improve further as the labor market strengthens. The government forecasts that real GDP will grow significantly in 2023, between 3.5% and 5.5%. However, Hong Kong’s economic growth outlook remains subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, largely depending on the trajectory of U.S. Federal Reserve policy interest rates, global growth prospects, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the pace of inbound tourism recovery.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to rise slightly but should remain moderate, as various factors will balance each other out. While external prices are likely to stay high, their upward trend may weaken due to slowing economies in major markets and easing pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, local cost pressures may increase slightly as the economy recovers and the labor market improves, but soft residential rents should continue to help offset this effect. The government forecasts overall and core inflation rates of 2.9% and 2.5% for 2023. On the other hand, the labor market is expected to improve further as local economic activity returns to normal.\n\n# State of the Banking System\n\nHong Kong's banking system navigated a challenging macroeconomic landscape in 2022, contending with the early outbreak of the fifth COVID-19 wave, escalating geopolitical tensions, and substantial interest rate increases by major central banks worldwide aimed at curbing inflation. Despite these headwinds, the banking sector demonstrated resilience, maintaining robust capital and liquidity positions. While credit risk within the system increased throughout the year, overall asset quality remained healthy. Concurrently, higher interest rates bolstered net interest income for banks; however, this gain was partially offset by increased provisions for potential loan losses and a decline in fee and commission revenue. Overall, retail banking profitability improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Assessment\n\nThe specific loan classification ratio of the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). The ratio for related loans in mainland China was 2.21% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. This increase was primarily due to downgrades in credit ratings for some real estate developers in mainland China. Nevertheless, banks maintained adequate loan loss reserves. As of the end of 2022, the loan loss reserve coverage ratio—the ratio of loan loss reserves to non-performing loans—remained approximately at 80%. After deducting the recoverable value of collateral from non-performing loan balances, this ratio was approximately 140%. On the other hand, delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\nNote: Figures include the Hong Kong branch, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority)\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Rates for Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profitability Trend\n\nThe banking sector continued to record profits in 2022. Overall pre-tax operating profit for retail banks rose by 19.0% during the year (Figure 7). This improvement was driven by increased net interest income (+34%) and higher revenue from foreign exchange and derivatives (+72%), although this growth was partially offset by increased impairment provisions (+151%) and a decline in fee and commission income (-19%). In a rising interest rate environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility also contributed to higher income from foreign exchange and derivatives businesses. The increase in impairment provisions was due to the need to set aside special reserves for newly classified loans, while weaker financial market performance resulted in lower fee and commission income. The cost-to-income ratio for retail banks decreased from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banks Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banking. Data Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Balance Sheet Performance\n\nThe banking system’s balance sheet expanded by 2.5% in 2022. This growth was primarily due to an increase in the market value of foreign exchange and derivative holdings. Loan demand weakened during the year, influenced by external uncertainties and rising interest rates. Total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022, a significant shift from the 3.8% increase recorded in 2021. Loans outside Hong Kong declined by 10.2%, while trade financing decreased by 13.5%. Within Hong Kong, loans increased slightly by 0.9%. Loans to Mainland China decreased by 4.4% in 2022, following a 3.7% increase the previous year.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the balance sheet, bank deposits continued to grow moderately. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2021. This growth in deposits, coupled with a decrease in total loans, resulted in a slight decline in the overall loan-to-deposit ratio, from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Position\n\nThe banking sector maintained a sound capital position in 2022. As of the end of 2022, the combined capital adequacy ratio for local financial institutions was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both ratios were significantly higher than the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% as of the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System.\nData Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity Assessment\n\nThe banking system’s liquidity position remained robust, serving as a crucial pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 162.3%, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Figure 13). Customer deposits remain the primary source of funding for the banking system. As of the end of 2022, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios were significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 14: Capital Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n"}

Driven by increased trading activity in the Hong Kong stock market and year-end funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) generally followed US interbank rates. Due to continued interest rate hikes in the United States, HIBOR rose steadily throughout 2022. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money market remained stable, with smooth transactions. As the cornerstone of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated a strong ability to withstand external shocks.\n\n# Goals\n\nHong Kong’s monetary policy primarily aims to maintain currency stability, ensuring the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar. This system operates as a currency board, requiring the Exchange Fund to hold US dollar reserves that fully back the monetary base. These reserves must be adjusted in direct proportion to any changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (fully backing banknotes issued by the three issuing banks);\n- Government-issued banknotes and coins in circulation;\n- The total balance of settlement accounts held at the HKMA (i.e., total balances); and\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to the exchange rate guarantee. When the strong (or weak) exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars at a rate of HK$7.75 per U.S. dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at HK$7.85), increasing (or decreasing) the aggregate balance, which in turn lowers (or raises) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the HK$7.75-7.85 exchange rate range.\n\n# 2022 in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar weakened in early 2022, influenced by adjustments in the local stock market, expectations of further U.S. interest rate increases, and carry trades related to the negative interest rate difference between Hong Kong and London interbank rates. Throughout the following months, the Hong Kong dollar remained near the weak exchange rate guarantee level, which was triggered 41 times between May and November.  Trading activity in the local stock market increased, and seasonal funding demand rose at year-end, prompting the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen from mid-November (see Figure 1). Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued an additional HK$40 billion in Exchange Fund Bills at the beginning of 2022 to meet continued demand from banks. Between May and November 2022, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$242.1 billion under the Linked Exchange Rate System, intervening to support the Hong Kong dollar at the weak-side convertibility point in response to bank requests. As a result, total reserves decreased from HK$3,775 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$963 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting both the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the triggering of the weak-side convertibility arrangement. During the year, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and bonds increased slightly, from HK$11,488 billion to HK$12,004 billion. Consequently, the combined total of total reserves and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and bonds decreased from HK$15,263 billion at the end of 2021 to HK$12,967 billion at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remained fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1: 2022 Market Exchange Rates\n\nFigure 2: 2022 Net Balance (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) generally follows the trend of the US dollar interbank offered rate. As the United States continued to raise interest rates in 2022, HIBOR gradually increased (Figure 3). For the year, overnight, one-month, and three-month HIBOR rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, respectively, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% by year-end.\n\nIn response to increases in the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range, the benchmark rate was raised seven times, totaling 4.25 percentage points (equivalent to 425 basis points), rising from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, several banks increased their prime lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, followed by further increases of 25 basis points in early November and mid-December. Some banks also raised the upper limit for new mortgage interest rates based on the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate smoothly. Discount window lending increased from HKD 6.8 billion in 2021 to HKD 8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (2022)\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate Regime\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a vital pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating a strong ability to respond to challenges. Despite volatile global financial conditions in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner, reflecting the system’s stability and effectiveness. The government remains resolutely committed to maintaining the system. The International Monetary Fund, in its “2022 External Sector Report,” repeatedly affirmed that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and prudent fiscal arrangements, all of which ensure the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate system. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions well above international standards. To ensure the banking system’s resilience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been scrutinizing banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintains oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated for support, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide a strong backing for the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of Support Ratio in 2022\n\n# Currency Management Committee\n\nThe Currency Board, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2022, its discussions included the property market situation in mainland China, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. Meeting minutes and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s reports on the Currency Board’s operations are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to hold seminars to educate bank counter staff, retail cashiers, and students about the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes, enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes. In 2022, the HKMA held 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Physical Currency Collection Plan\n\nThe coin collection program continues to be popular among citizens. Details of the program are included in the \"Sustainable Development Initiatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" chapter of the 2022 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Bills and taking into account market conditions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a total of HK$40 billion in Exchange Fund Bills during the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the outstanding balance. As of the end of 2022, the outstanding nominal value of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds totalled approximately HK$1,207.5 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Monetary Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMFR) completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and hosted 16 seminars and webinars covering monetary and financial research topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Institute has also made arrangements to disseminate its research findings through a new open-access e-journal, ensuring broader access to the information. In addition, HKIMFR launched a new publication series, “Insights from Monetary Research Digest,” on its website, providing high-level summaries of the Institute’s recent research for the public.\n\nIn addition to its research findings, the research center hosted two international conferences and three online expert seminars, fostering dialogue and exchange on economic and financial matters.\n\nOn April 12, the Financial Institute co-hosted an online seminar with the School of Finance titled \"Latest Developments in Macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve's Tightening Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore RMB Market.\" The event featured Mr. Norman Chan, former Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Professor Huang Yiping, Deputy Dean and Jin Guang Professor of Economics at the National School of Development, Peking University, as guest speakers. The seminar was live-streamed on multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers.\n\nA webinar on “Transformation and Policy Choices in the Chinese Real Estate Industry” was held on June 24th, featuring Qin Hong, Senior Research Fellow at Renmin University and former Director of the Policy Research Center of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as a guest speaker. The event was moderated by Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist at UBS, and attracted approximately 1.13 million online viewers from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and other parts of the world.\n\nOn August 25, an online workshop titled \"Monetary Policy Spillover Effects\" was jointly organized with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, with over 200 experts from central banks, international financial institutions, and academia around the world participating online.\n\nAs a side event to the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit, the School of Finance co-hosted an online seminar titled \"Inflation After COVID-19: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" on November 2nd. The seminar featured analysis by Dr. Quilin Li, founder and chief economist of International Monetary Observation, and former chief economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Nearly 200 economists participated online.\n\nThe 12th Annual China Economic Seminar was held on November 23, with the theme \"A New Stage of China's Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Deputy Chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges and Chairman of the Academic Committee, delivered a keynote speech on China's short-term and long-term economic prospects.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","en":"# The banking system is stable.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2022, despite a macroeconomic environment marked by uncertainties and challenges, as well as volatility in financial markets. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened its supervision of credit and market risk management for authorized institutions. Furthermore, given the increasing prevalence of cyber threats and the accelerated digital transformation of the banking sector, the HKMA collaborated closely with these institutions to enhance their operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened consumer protection for “buy now, pay later” products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing. The HKMA has also collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new regulatory regime for trust businesses. This year saw the launch of a credit information platform, operating under a model involving multiple credit information service providers, for personal credit data, alongside a new mandatory background check program designed to address the accumulation of non-performing assets. In addition, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in introducing convenient measures to help customers reactivate their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest risk assessment regarding money laundering and terrorist financing in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is collaborating with banks through public-private partnerships, including the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group, to strengthen Hong Kong’s defenses against these threats and enhance fraud prevention. The HKMA is also partnering with strategic partners to better understand and manage the risks and instability stemming from an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. To further promote the use of data and technology within the financial sector, the HKMA has launched a series of “Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratories,” while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology (RegTech) in its own anti-money laundering efforts. Internationally, the HKMA actively participates in the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nIn 2022, significant progress was made in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure requirements, locally. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also actively enhanced industry expertise by fostering a sustainable talent pipeline and improving the skills of existing professionals. Throughout the year, the HKMA worked closely with the banking sector to refine and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to advance its work at both local and international levels to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime. Specific initiatives include developing new resolution standards, conducting regional crisis simulation exercises, and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all locally systemically important banks, marking a milestone in the HKMA’s efforts to enhance resolvability.\n\n# Aim\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s key objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing essential financial services for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operating methods, or in extreme cases, through disorderly failure. As a regulator, the Commissioner of Financial Services plays a vital role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks have the ability to withstand shocks and recover from crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Commissioner of Financial Services is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks, and for authorizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as “authorized institutions”).\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as a key resolution authority, strives to ensure that financial institutions can be handled in an orderly manner should they become unsustainable. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution framework under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for regulated entities. Implementing this framework requires the development of resolution rules and policy standards, resolution planning to address potential obstacles, and the establishment of the HKMA’s operational capacity to resolve failing institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts approaches that are consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures. The HKMA oversees these infrastructures to promote their overall safety and efficiency, control systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Bolstering the resilience of these infrastructures safeguards Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, preventing instability caused by operational disruptions.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# License-Related Matters\n\nWithin the year, the Financial Supervisory Administration approved six overseas trading platforms to become currency brokers, while the licenses of five licensed banks and one bank with a restricted license were revoked.\n\nSee the appendices for details on accredited institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong on pages 283-286, and Tables D to F on pages 292-295.\n\n# Regulatory Summary\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted 183 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL assessments, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of financial technology by authorized institutions. To further strengthen the risk governance of these institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or board committees, and conducted 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducts regular on-site inspections of authorized institutions, in addition to off-site reviews. From a prudential regulatory perspective, credit risk management is a primary focus.  Increasingly, with banks adopting technology, operational and technology risk management are also key areas of oversight.  With the rapid growth of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the Authority has recently completed a thematic review focused on climate risk management.  For conduct supervision, the HKMA conducts on-site inspections of authorized institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) operations, supplementing these with targeted assessments of higher-risk areas.\n\nTable 1 presents a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Regulatory Work\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Expansion and Asset Quality\n\nTotal loan amount decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans. The total amount of loans related to Mainland China also decreased by 4.4% to HKD 45,220 billion in 2022 (Table 3).\n\nThe banking system remained stable and sound throughout the year, despite facing challenges and shocks from various sources, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, the pace of interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deteriorating financial conditions of some mainland property developers.\n\nThe non-performing loan ratio in the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. It was 1.38% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The non-performing loan ratio for Mainland China-related loans rose from 0.89% a year earlier to 2.21%.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority enhanced its risk monitoring and maintained close communication with authorized institutions to promptly assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of these institutions. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remains manageable. The results of the HKMA's debt stress tests indicate that the banking system continues to maintain adequate capital buffers and can withstand extreme stress.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic review this year to assess the credit risk management of authorized institutions, with a focus on asset quality, risk exposure to vulnerable sectors, and credit risk at branches outside Hong Kong, including secured lending to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\n---\nOn the other hand, in the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of businesses are facing financial difficulties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages licensed institutions to handle cases of corporate repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles outlined in the Hong Kong Code of Practice on Corporate Financial Difficulties, enabling them to coordinate collaborative solutions.\n\nTable 3: Domestic Loan Growth\n\n# Relieve customers’ cash flow strain.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the SME Loan Support Scheme, has extended the pre-approved interest-only repayment scheme until the end of July 2023. To help businesses prepare for a return to regular repayments, the scheme has also introduced and refined several options for resuming principal payments.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, banks approved over 108,000 cases of corporate customer loan deferrals and other support measures, involving an amount exceeding HKD 1.1 trillion. For individual customers, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage interest-only payments and other personal emergency loans, involving an amount exceeding HKD 65 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures to strengthen banks' risk management and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against potential property market reversals. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% before the first round of these measures was introduced in September 2009. The average debt-to-income ratio for new mortgages has remained low, standing at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will reduce the stress test benchmark for mortgage interest rates from 300 to 200 basis points, effective in September. This decision reflects the current interest rate environment and the historical average trend of mortgage rates. The HKMA believes this adjustment provides sufficient assurance of sound risk management within the banking sector’s mortgage portfolios.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio of Newly Approved Residential Mortgages.\n\n# Operational and Technology Risk\n\nOver the past year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced several measures to enhance the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures included the release in May of a new section, \"Operational Resilience,\" within the Regulatory Policy Manual, outlining the governance and control frameworks that authorized institutions are expected to maintain. The HKMA also hosted two industry dialogues to facilitate knowledge sharing and promote understanding of the new standards (Figure 1).\n\nThe HKMA also provides detailed regulatory guidelines on specific areas of bank operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defenses against distributed denial-of-service attacks.\n\nIn response to evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is enhancing the banking system's cyber defense capabilities by promoting robust triple data backup arrangements among banks, monitoring the implementation of the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" 2.0 by licensed banks, and assessing banks’ ability to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nDigital Key's Got Your Back – Think Before You Click! In response to the growing risk of phishing scams and other online fraud, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched a new public awareness campaign in September with this theme. In July, they also collaborated with the Hong Kong Police Force to hold a workshop for banks, outlining the latest scam techniques.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign: Protect your digital key – think twice before clicking the link!\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogue \"Moving Towards Operational Stability\"\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk Factors\n\nIn response to increased market volatility caused by further tightening of monetary policies by major economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened its monitoring of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA is conducting reviews to assess whether authorized institutions have adequate liquidity risk management, with a focus on the diversification of funding sources and the systems and controls for group-wide liquidity risk management.

{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」舉辦成功，吸引來自約120間環球金融機構超過200位國際及區內領袖參加，不僅鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，更製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n在鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐方面，多個範疇均取得理想進展，包括優化金管局與中國人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議，以及金管局的人民幣流動資金安排，確保有足夠人民幣流動性，協助進一步推進離岸人民幣產品及市場發展；與中國人民銀行和證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合宣布開展「互換通」；與證券及期貨事務監察委員會和香港交易及結算所有限公司合作推出雙櫃台莊家機制，推動人民幣計價股票在香港交易；以及金管局推出多年期計劃，進一步優化金融市場基建及發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。受惠於充足的人民幣流動性，並憑藉世界級的市場基建及內地與香港之間各個互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入國際市場及國際投資者投資於快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n金管局在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家認識香港穩健的金融體系及其帶來的前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界更廣泛採用金融科技全面鞏固香港的金融科技樞紐地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」繼續穩步增長，登記數目在3月份突破1,000萬個，每日平均交易量亦在9月份超越100萬宗。\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織，對維持金融穩定及促進市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局繼續主動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。於11月，金管局舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，落實財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布的計劃。峰會為期3日，雲集國際金融業界翹楚，就如何在各項不確定因素下把握機遇分享各自獨到的觀點。是項活動獲得極大迴響，吸引超過200位來自約120個國際金融機構的重量級嘉賓參加，充分體現全球金融界對香港的支持。\n\n香港進一步鞏固其作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位，年內離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。香港在促進內地與國際金融市場之間的資金流方面發揮關鍵作用，香港與內地間的互聯互通機制被公認為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場及內地投資者配置離岸資產的首選渠道。在2022年，債券通「北向通」成交額佔境外投資者在中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。債券通「南向通」及「跨境理財通」自2021年開通以來一直運作暢順。金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）聯合宣布開展「互換通」，把香港與內地的金融合作進一步擴展至衍生品市場，並強化了香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務樞紐及風險管理中心的地位。金管局與人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議於7月優化，是加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的另一重要里程碑。\n\n為在香港提供更多元的人民幣計價產品，由金管局、證監會與香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組完成擴大人民幣在港股市場交易中的使用的可行性研究。工作小組已展開籌備工作，包括推出雙櫃台莊家機制，以優化港幣及人民幣雙櫃台股票的交易機制。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增加香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新，以及鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室繼續與各銀行部門聯手實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n- 促進合規科技應用及進行金融科技應用評估；\n- 推動批發層面央行數碼貨幣的工作，致力改善跨境支付；\n- 加深在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」或e-HKD）的研究；\n- 推出「商業數據通」；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 善用資源政策支持金融科技生態圈；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n金融基建的可靠及有效運作，是鞏固香港作為主要國際金融中心地位的關鍵。在2022年，處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統(CMU)及香港交易資料儲存庫均達到100%2的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。債券通「北向通」及「南向通」的交收服務維持暢順。年底時存放在CMU系統的債券中，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為12,075億港元，其他債券的未償還總額增至相當於15,733億港元，是2013年以來最高水平。\n\n「轉數快」使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察6個指定零售支付系統，並監管17個持牌儲值支付工具（其中4個由持牌銀行發行）。年內為繼續協助政府順利實施消費券計劃，金管局協調及促進相關政府部門與就計劃獲委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的溝通及合作。\n\n金管局在2023年1月發布加密資產和穩定幣討論文件的總結，歸納就討論文件收集到的意見和金管局的回應。總結文件確認金管局將會以風險為本和靈活的方式監管穩定幣，並闡述預期的監管範圍、主要的監管要求及下一步的工作。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。自2018年起，金管局在東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)3轄下金融市場工作小組連任三屆主席。此外，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組與金融創新網絡的聯席主席，另又領導金融穩定理事會轄下監察金融基準過渡相關監管事項的進度及作出跟進的小組。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 國際金融領袖投資峰會\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行\n\n繼財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布，金管局於11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期3日，反響熱烈，匯聚26位金融業界翹楚就應對經濟、金融、科技及地緣政治不穩定因素，以及如何把握當中的機遇分享獨到觀點和想法。峰會共有超過200位來自約120間全球金融機構的參加者，當中超過40間機構均由集團董事長或行政總裁親自出席。參與峰會的機構不乏位列全球最大的銀行、證券、資產管理、主權財富基金、私募股權與風險投資、對冲基金及保險公司等金融界別。\n\n峰會向全球發出明確訊息，表明香港已經一切復常；全球金融領袖可以親身感受香港獨有的韌性和活力並了解發展亞洲業務的過程中香港可以提供的機遇。\n\n# 香港作為進入內地的主要門戶及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n香港致力鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，包括增強離岸流動性、進一步加強與內地金融市場的聯通，以及提升金融市場基建。年內人民幣業務，包括銀行存款、貿易結算、支付及離岸債券發行，繼續錄得穩健增長。在增強流動性、產品開發及擴大互聯互通機制方面，取得令人鼓舞的進展及成績。2022年國際結算銀行三年一度的外匯及衍生工具市場成交額調查結果，再次確認香港作為人民幣外匯中心的領先地位。\n\n債券通「北向通」繼續是國際投資者透過香港的市場基建及金融服務投資內地債券市場的主要渠道。債券通「北向通」於2022年的平均每日成交額達322億元人民幣（較2021年增加25%），佔境外投資者於中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。\n\n債券通「北向通」於7月份推出技術優化措施，包括將投資者參與境內債券一級市場發行的流程電子化及降低服務費。這些市場為本的優化措施提高債券通「北向通」的運作效率，亦降低投資者的交易成本。\n\n為完善債券通「北向通」的配套，並便利國際投資者管理內地債券投資相關的利率風險，香港與內地於7月宣布開展兩地利率互換市場互聯互通合作（「互換通」）。「互換通」初期會先開通北向交易，讓國際投資者透過香港與內地基礎設施機構之間的連接交易內地的利率互換產品，從而強化香港作為風險管理中心的地位。「互換通」籌備工作正在有序推進，以期盡快開通北向交易。金管局會繼續聯同有關當局及機構探索提供更多元化的風險管理工具，包括推出離岸國債期貨，進一步支持國際投資者投資內地債券市場。\n\n債券通「南向通」於2021年開通以來市場反應正面，運作暢順，交易涵蓋可在香港市場買賣並以多種貨幣計價的主要債券產品。「南向通」促進了離岸人民幣市場的發展，尤其人民幣計價債務工具發行的顯著增長。金管局正與內地有關當局緊密合作，研究優化債券通「南向通」，促進香港債券市場的多元發展。\n","en":"# Hong Kong: An International Financial Hub\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority made significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a globally competitive international financial center through a range of measures.\n\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was a resounding success, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions. It solidified Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center and generated positive ripple effects.\n\nHong Kong has made significant progress in solidifying its position as a global offshore RMB hub. This includes optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the HKMA’s RMB liquidity arrangements to ensure sufficient RMB liquidity and support the development of offshore RMB products and markets. The HKMA, together with the PBOC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of “Swap Connect.” In collaboration with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), a dual-counter mechanism was introduced to promote the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, the HKMA launched a multi-year plan to further enhance financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Clearing System for Debt Instruments into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia. Benefiting from ample RMB liquidity and supported by world-class market infrastructure and various interconnectivity mechanisms between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for Mainland capital to access international markets and for international investors to invest in the Mainland’s rapidly growing market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s financial platform, encompassing areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has stepped up its outreach to overseas and mainland stakeholders, showcasing Hong Kong’s resilient financial system and the opportunities it provides.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to implement the “FinTech 2025” strategy, promoting wider adoption of financial technology across the industry to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a financial technology hub. The fast payment system “轉數快 (Hong Kong's Fast Payment System)” continues to grow steadily, with registrations exceeding 10 million in March, and the average daily transaction volume surpassing 1 million in September.\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums, contributing to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial center. In November, the HKMA hosted the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit to implement the plan announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget Address. The three-day summit convened prominent figures from the global financial industry, who shared their insights on navigating uncertainties and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. The event drew a strong response, attracting over 200 high-level representatives from approximately 120 international financial institutions, underscoring the global financial community’s commitment to Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has further solidified its position as a leading offshore Renminbi hub, with steady growth in offshore Renminbi business throughout the year. Hong Kong plays a crucial role in facilitating the flow of capital between mainland China and international financial markets, and the mutual market access mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland are recognized as a preferred channel for international investors accessing mainland capital markets and for mainland investors allocating assets offshore. In 2022, trading volume through Bond Connect’s northbound link accounted for 61% of the overall trading volume of overseas investors in the mainland’s interbank bond market. Both Bond Connect’s southbound link and the Cross-border Wealth Management Connect have operated smoothly since their launch in 2021. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), together with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of “Swap Connect,” further expanding financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland into the derivatives market and strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a major offshore Renminbi hub and risk management center. The existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBOC was optimized in July, marking another significant milestone in strengthening Hong Kong’s role as an offshore Renminbi hub.\n\nTo offer a wider range of RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group composed of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in the Hong Kong stock market. The working group has begun preparatory work, including the introduction of a dual-counter market maker mechanism to optimize trading for stocks denominated in both Hong Kong dollars and RMB.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority remains committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial sector competitiveness. Specifically, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a leading fund management center, the HKMA is working closely with the government and the financial industry to create a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in the Hong Kong bond market and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. Simultaneously, the HKMA is intensifying its market promotion efforts to introduce Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders both overseas and on the mainland.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Facilitation Office continues to collaborate with banking departments to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech and enhancing Hong Kong's position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives this year include:\n- Promoting the application of regulatory technology and conducting fintech application assessments;\n- Advancing work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) at the wholesale level to improve cross-border payments;\n- Deepening research on the issuance of retail-level CBDC (i.e., \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" or e-HKD);\n- Launching the \"Commercial Data Exchange\";\n- Strengthening talent development;\n- Leveraging policy support to foster the fintech ecosystem;\n- Enhancing cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promoting broader adoption of the Fast Payment System “TransferFast” (FPS).\n\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is crucial to maintaining Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems processing interbank transactions, the Central Securities Clearing System, and the Hong Kong Trade Data Repository all achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Settlement services for the Bond Connect Northbound and Southbound channels continued to operate smoothly. By year-end, the total outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund notes and bonds held in the Central Securities Clearing System reached HKD 12,075 billion, while the total outstanding amount of other bonds increased to HKD 15,733 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe usage of FPS (Fast Payment System) continued to grow in 2022. By the end of the year, there were 11.48 million registered users, a 40% increase in daily transaction volume compared to 2021. Alongside steady growth in person-to-person and business payments, increased use of FPS for paying government bills, making payments to merchants, and topping up e-wallets or bank accounts has been the primary driver of this growth.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed stored value facilities, four of which are issued by licensed banks, under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”). Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to assist the government in the smooth implementation of the consumption voucher scheme by coordinating communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and the licensed stored value facility operators appointed for the scheme.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a summary in January 2023 of the responses to its discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins, detailing the feedback received and the HKMA’s responses. The summary confirms the HKMA will regulate stablecoins using a risk-based and flexible approach, and specifies the anticipated scope of regulation, key requirements, and next steps.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively participates in international central banking affairs and holds leadership positions in numerous regional and international committees. Since 2018, the Authority has served three consecutive terms as chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP). Additionally, it co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as well as the Non-Bank Supervision Expert Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board. The Authority also leads the group under the Financial Stability Board responsible for monitoring progress and follow-up on regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# International Financial Leaders Forum\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit was held from November 1st to 3rd.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" in November, following an announcement in the 2022-23 Budget. The three-day summit met with great enthusiasm, bringing together 26 prominent leaders from the financial industry to share their perspectives on navigating economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical uncertainties and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions attended, including more than 40 institutions represented by their top executives. These included some of the world’s largest banks, securities firms, asset management companies, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit sent a clear message to the world that Hong Kong has returned to normal; global financial leaders can personally experience Hong Kong’s unique resilience and vitality and understand the opportunities Hong Kong offers for expanding business in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong is a key gateway to the mainland and a global Renminbi hub.\n\nHong Kong remains committed to strengthening its position as a leading global hub for offshore Renminbi (RMB) business, including enhancing liquidity, deepening financial links with mainland China, and upgrading financial infrastructure. Throughout the year, RMB-denominated activities—such as bank deposits, trade settlement, payments, and offshore bond issuance—continued to grow steadily. Significant progress has been made in enhancing liquidity, developing new products, and expanding cross-border connectivity. The Bank for International Settlements’ 2022 triennial survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover reaffirmed Hong Kong’s leading role as an RMB exchange center.\n\nBond Connect’s Northbound program remains the primary channel for international investors to access China’s bond market through Hong Kong’s market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the program’s average daily trading volume reached RMB 32.2 billion, a 25% increase compared to 2021, accounting for 61% of the total trading volume by foreign investors in the China interbank bond market.\n\nBond Connect’s Northbound Trading introduced technical upgrades in July, including electronic processing for investors participating in the primary market issuance of domestic bonds and reduced service fees. These investor-friendly changes have boosted operational efficiency and lowered transaction costs.\n\nTo enhance the supporting arrangements for the Bond Connect’s Northbound Trading and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their investments in the mainland bond market, Hong Kong and mainland China announced in July the launch of a connectivity initiative for their interest rate swap markets (\"Swap Connect\"). Initially, Swap Connect will commence with Northbound trading, allowing international investors to trade mainland interest rate swap products through connections between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a risk management hub. Preparations for Swap Connect are progressing in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching Northbound trading as soon as possible. The HKMA will continue to collaborate with relevant authorities and institutions to explore a more diversified range of risk management tools, including the introduction of offshore China government bond futures, to further support international investors in investing in the mainland bond market.\n\nBond Connect’s southbound trading, launched in 2021, has garnered a positive market response and operated smoothly. It allows trading of major bond products in the Hong Kong market, priced in various currencies, and has fueled the development of the offshore RMB market, particularly the significant growth in RMB-denominated debt issuances. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working closely with mainland authorities to optimize the southbound channel and promote the diversified development of Hong Kong’s bond market.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2022年）\n","en":"# Strategic Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. This challenged the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could mitigate risk, and marked the first time in nearly half a century that stocks, bonds, and major non-dollar currencies all recorded negative returns in the same year. Under these adverse conditions, the Exchange Fund recorded a negative investment return of 4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses experienced by most multi-asset funds during the year, the Exchange Fund’s performance reflected the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s diversified, long-term asset allocation and strategic adjustments made in response to evolving market conditions, effectively reducing the impact of the market turmoil.\n\n# Hong Kong Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, and to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, under the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(i) Safeguarding capital;\n(ii) Ensuring that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(iii) Ensuring sufficient liquidity is maintained to support monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Pursuing investment returns consistent with the above (i) to (iii), to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Portfolio Categories of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full support for the currency base in accordance with the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of OECD member economies to safeguard asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s assets to enhance long-term returns and manage risk, allocating investments to a wider range of asset classes, including emerging markets and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and mainland China bonds and equities are held within the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are managed through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, alongside allocations for other asset classes, is determined by prudent risk management and diversification strategies.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, purchased by the government for strategic purposes through the Exchange Fund. Because of this portfolio’s unique nature, its performance is not included in the Exchange Fund’s investment assessment.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of its investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a notable example. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is tied to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate determined by their allocation. In 2022, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in an investment benchmark, representing the long-term asset mix the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide, and through tactical asset allocation, it seeks to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and this difference is known as “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and define the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage their positions within this range to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Foreign Direct Investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority manages the Exchange Fund’s investments and related risk. The office’s staff directly manage approximately 70% of these investments, including a core portfolio and portions of other investment portfolios. This internally managed portion includes investments in various global fixed-income markets and utilizes derivatives to execute the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies.\n\n# Contract Investment Manager\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority manages assets internally, but also engages external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialized asset categories. This allows the Authority to tap into market expertise, generate sustainable returns, and benefit from diverse and complementary investment strategies.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Scrutiny\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making risk management paramount. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has implemented rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA employs three lines of defense for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors key investment risk categories, including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks, and the risk management framework provides a robust framework for the strategic planning and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investments.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of investments can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives and reduce environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks associated with investment activities. When ESG investments offer comparable risk-adjusted long-term returns to other investment options, the Authority generally prioritizes ESG investments in accordance with its established guiding principles and has incorporated ESG factors into the investment management process for both the Exchange Fund’s public and private markets. Details of the Authority’s responsible investment framework and implementation can be found in the “Responsible Investment” chapter of the Sustainable Development Report 2022.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2022\n\nIn 2022, global financial markets experienced significant volatility, with bond and stock markets declining cumulatively by 16.2% and 19.8%, respectively.\n\nMajor stock market indices declined significantly this year, pressured by rising global inflation, tight monetary policy, and slowing economic growth. Although global markets saw a slight year-end rebound fueled by expectations of inflation and interest rate peaks, the U.S. S&P 500 still fell by 19.4%, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index declined by 15.5%.\n\nDue to rising interest rates by central banks worldwide in an effort to combat inflation, government bond yields in major markets have continued to rise. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note climbed from 1.63% in early 2022 to surpass 4% by the fourth quarter, reaching its highest level since 2008. The U.S. Treasury yield curve has inverted since mid-year, with the inversion widening and increasing market concerns about an economic recession.\n\nThe U.S. dollar strengthened significantly in 2022, driven by successive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Renminbi, all lost value against the dollar; the British pound and Japanese yen fell by 10.7% and 12.2%, respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies and stock and bond markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Market Returns\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HKD 205.4 billion in 2022. This included HKD 53.2 billion in losses on debt instruments, HKD 80.5 billion in equity investment losses (comprising HKD 61 billion from overseas equity investments and HKD 19.5 billion from Hong Kong equity investments), a HKD 40 billion decrease in the valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets due to exchange rate fluctuations, and HKD 31.7 billion in losses from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. Separately, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 8.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HK$40,080 billion. The total market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$4,847 billion, including HK$3,700 billion in private equity and HK$1,147 billion in real estate. A total of HK$2,708 billion had been committed but not yet drawn down for investment within the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding strategic asset allocation) reported an investment return of -4.5% in 2022, with the investment portfolio returning -8.6% and the support portfolio returning -0.4%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Foreign Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 displays the investment returns of the Foreign Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment returns over different periods.

The Financial Department prepares the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of various expenditure items and budget data in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and Oversight\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks in the monetary and banking system is one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's most important tasks. Risk management is reflected not only in strategic planning but also in day-to-day operations. The HKMA’s risk management framework includes two high-level committees: the Macro-prudential Oversight Committee and the Risk Committee, both of which are chaired by the HKMA’s Chief Executive.\n\nThe Macroprudential Oversight Committee’s responsibilities are as follows:\n- To identify potential risks and threats facing the Hong Kong monetary and financial system, and discuss feasible countermeasures;\n- To review existing risk management measures for the monetary and financial system, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and\n- To encourage cross-departmental sharing of macroprudential information to enhance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's oversight capabilities.\n\nThe Risk Committee’s scope of authority is as follows:\n- Identifying potential risks and threats facing the HKMA and developing strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- Reviewing existing risk management systems across departments, identifying potential vulnerabilities and significant risks, and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to address them;\n- Standardizing risk assessment criteria and methodologies, and prioritizing resource allocation based on identified risks; and\n- Promoting and strengthening a risk management culture within the HKMA, encouraging appropriate delegation and monitoring.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains a robust operational risk management framework that addresses organizational risks at both the institutional and departmental levels. These institutional risks generally refer to medium-term risks affecting the entire organization or those requiring collaboration across departments. Each department is required to review and report potential and emerging risks quarterly, along with proposed monitoring measures and mitigation strategies. This process is supported by a top-down institutional risk management approach, where senior management identifies significant risks and recommends mitigation measures. The Risk Committee regularly reviews these assessments and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department independently and objectively assesses whether the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s governance, risk management, and monitoring controls are adequate and effective. Functionally, the Department reports to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and administratively to the HKMA’s Chief Executive. The Internal Audit Department employs a risk-based approach in conducting its operations and information systems audits, covering all major risk areas.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第179頁至281頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2022年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2022年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共38,361.82億港元，金融負債共12,074.98億港元。\n\n87%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘13%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共4,876.94億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2022年12月31日共值233.94億港元。集團亦於4間聯營公司及22間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值396.31億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2022年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n林智遠教授\n\n審計署\n香港\n金鐘道66號\n\n2023 年 4 月 11 日\n","en":"# Exchange Fund\n\nAuditor General's Report\nForeign Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Suggestions\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which are listed on pages 179 to 281. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2022, the statement of income and expenses, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity, and the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nThe financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2022, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis for Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities relating to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section \"Auditor's Responsibilities\" of this report. In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Significant Audit Observations\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most important to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I considered these matters in forming my opinion on the financial statements as a whole and will not provide a separate opinion on them.\n\n# Fair Value Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n\nSee Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group’s financial assets carried at fair value amounted to HKD 38,361.82 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 12,074.98 billion.\n\n87% of these financial assets and all financial liabilities are valued at fair value, either using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or through valuation techniques that incorporate observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 13% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These assets total HKD 487.69 billion, primarily consisting of unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related controls;\n- Evaluating and testing these controls, including application controls within computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when market quotations are used;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of related assumptions, and verifying parameters against independent sources when the valuation method’s parameters are based on observable market data; and\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of related assumptions and parameters when the valuation method’s parameters are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Fair Value Measurement of Investment Property\n\nNotes to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value and totaled HKD 233.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds interests in four jointly controlled entities and twenty-two associate companies, whose principal business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with the aggregate value of these interests amounting to HKD 396.31 billion. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by its jointly controlled entities or associate companies, is primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, verifying that the fair value is based on the valuations presented in those reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters used.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is accountable for all other information contained in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2022 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, nor do I provide any form of verification regarding such information.\n\nI have a responsibility to review other information to consider whether it materially contradicts the financial statements or information I obtained during the audit, or appears to contain material misstatements. If I conclude that other information contains material misstatements, I am required to report that fact. I have found no such discrepancies.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Secretary and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with respect to financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that they deem necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial managers are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing matters related to the going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report including my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not provide absolute assurance that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will detect all material misstatements. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to those risks; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence upon which to base my opinion. The risk of failing to detect a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect a material misstatement resulting from error, because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls.\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by management and the reasonableness of their accounting estimates and related disclosures.\n- Determine whether management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there are material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that material uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements. If the disclosures are inadequate, I will issue a qualified audit report. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the auditor’s report date. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and matters.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee's Audit Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls identified during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Review Committee, confirming that I have met all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and disclosing any relationships or matters that could reasonably affect my independence, along with any related safeguards where appropriate.\n\nBased on discussions with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most important to the audit of the current financial statements and therefore constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public disclosure, or in rare circumstances, I believe that disclosing a matter would result in adverse consequences that outweigh the public interest, and I decide not to disclose it in the report.\n\nAuditor General, Professor Lin Zhiyuan\n\nAudit Commission\nHong Kong\n66 Connaught Road Central\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}
