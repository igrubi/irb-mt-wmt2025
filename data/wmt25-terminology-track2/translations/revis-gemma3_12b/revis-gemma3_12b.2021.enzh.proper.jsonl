{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23

總裁報告\n\n二零二一年是鞏固與發展並進的一年。\n\n2021年，疫情持續未歇，進入第二年：全球供應鏈受到干擾，通脹壓力不斷上升，全球金融狀況過早收緊的風險增加。新冠病毒變異株的出現以及地緣政治緊張局勢的加劇，更增添了不確定性。儘管如此，我們持續維護貨幣和金融穩定，並保持運作穩健性。\n\n二零二一年也帶來了復甦的希望，伴隨著新冠疫苗的順利推行，以及多個經濟體引入的貨幣及財政政策。全球經濟開始從二零二零年的嚴重收縮中復甦。本地方面，在經歷了二零一九年和二零二零年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟在二零二一年增長了百分之六點三， وذلك 疫苗接種計劃及抗疫支援措施的推行，為我們的經濟復甦提供了關鍵支持。\n\n在金融及貨幣穩定維持，以及宏觀環境穩定的情況下，2021 年為我們提供了更多發展工作的空間。我們把握機會，積極推動有助於金融界保持高度競爭力的發展計劃。在三個重點策略範疇方面取得了顯著進展，分別是金融科技、綠色金融，以及藉由香港作為通往內地的門戶所帶來的內地市場機遇。\n\n踏入2022年，全球環境急轉直下。但正所謂逆境中見真章，我們將繼續積極主動，追求發展目標與優先事項，以更充分準備面對未來的挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦會堅定不移地致力確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩健，正如我們在過去屢次成功應對各種挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基礎\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並幫助香港抵禦了眾多衝擊和挑戰。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來的持續不確定性以及市場對美國收緊貨幣政策的擔憂，香港美元外匯及貨幣市場全年持續有序運作，反映出聯匯制度的穩健性。\n\n我們對制度的信心並非一朝一夕形成的，而是建立在多年來穩固的基礎之上。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年的對外部門報告中再次重申，聯匯制度的可信度已得益於一套透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政架構。\n\n信心也源於我們在公眾及市場溝通上的努力，以及有效的監察。在後者方面，我們利用科技及數據分析技術，提升我們對金融穩定及宏觀審慎監察的分析能力，使其更及時和全面。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。在新冠病毒疫情爆發兩年後，本港銀行憑藉良好的流動性水平和資本充足比率，表現出穩健的韌性，並符合國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.2%，遠高於8%的法定最低要求；而大型銀行在2021年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋比率為151.9%，亦遠高於100%的法定最低要求。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，銀行業的資產質素在當年仍大致保持穩定。截至2021年底，銀行業的特定分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟支柱。\n\n一如既往，銀行業是經濟活動的重要經濟支柱。面對新冠病毒疫情所帶來的經濟影響，此點尤為關鍵。 過去一年，主要挑戰在於如何在銀行業管理信用風險的同時，維持對實體經濟的支持。 憑藉我們多年的監管工作，銀行持續有效地管理信用風險。 同時，我們與銀行密切合作，透過預先批核還息不還本計劃（預先批核還息不還本計劃）及其他紓困措施，為企業客戶和個人客戶提供亟需的紓困。 該計劃於2020年與銀行業中小企貸款協調機制一同推出，允許符合資格的企業客戶在預先批准的基礎上延遲貸款本金六個月，並於2021年再次延期兩次，直至2022年4月，以表彰部分行業仍受到疫情的持續影響，並需要持續的信用紓困。 隨後，鑒於本地新冠病毒感染病例再次出現，於2022年2月，預先批核還息不還本計劃進一步延長至2022年10月底。 令人鼓舞的是，銀行業已與金管局合作，以協助緩解企業和個人客戶的現金流壓力，即使該行業本身也因疫情爆發而面臨自身的經營挑戰。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境外，疫情也帶來了更嚴峻的經營環境，以及日益嚴重的網絡威脅所籠罩的數碼環境。我們已加強措施，提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力，並強化消費者及投資者保障，以應對數碼化進程加速和網絡釣魚騙案激增的局面。特別是，銀行業行為守則已進行修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n除了監管工作外，我們致力於在銀行業推廣普及金融及以客為本的文化。提升有需要的市民使用銀行服務的方便性一直是我們的重點領域，我們亦一直與業界密切合作，制定行業指引。繼無障礙銀行服務及為智障人士提供銀行服務的指引後，業界在金管局的支持下，於2021年12月發表了一項指引，說明銀行業為認知障礙症患者及有需要市民提供銀行服務的原則及良好實踐。\n\n為支持銀行業未來持續發展，面對新的增長機會和挑戰，需要勞動力掌握一整套新技能，金管局制定了全面人才發展策略——「連接人才與未來」，以更系統和針對性的方式培養未來人才，並提升現有銀行從業員的技能。 我們的策略基於三個「連接」方向：連接學生與銀行業、連接銀行從業員與銀行業的未來，以及連接關鍵持份者，以加強策略實施的合作。 我們已推出一系列推廣及宣傳活動，吸引更多學生投身銀行業。為更好地幫助大學生做好準備，我們與香港銀行學會聯合推出了銀行業銜接課程，該課程涵蓋實用銀行知識及銀行業極具需求的軟技能。針對現有的銀行從業員，我們一直與業界緊密合作，提供更多符合需求的培訓課程，以提升他們的技能。2021年12月，銀行專業資歷架構下的金融科技新單元正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與所有相關持份者攜手合作，以加強人才庫，推動產業進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強勢地位由無與倫比的機會所奠定。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，得益於其提供的獨特的機會。各界普遍認為，全球金融科技應用、內地金融市場開放以及綠色和可持續金融的普及，為香港金融業的未來發展帶來了巨大的發展機會。在金管局，我們已投入大量資源，發揮香港獨有優勢，以把握這些潛力。先說說金融科技和內地市場的機會。\n\n# 全面應用金融科技\n\n疫情已清楚地證明了金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為了確保我們能持續領先全球金融科技領域，並準備好挖掘金融科技的全部潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓各層級的客戶都能體驗到金融科技的價值。\n\n這個願景驅使我們制定了「金融科技2025」策略，並於2021年6月正式發布。正如其名所示，該策略旨在協助金融界在2025年前全面應用金融科技。此策略涵蓋五個重點領域，這些領域包含構建成功生態系統所需的要素，以及推動生態系統在良性循環中持續發展的關鍵因素。策略的前兩部分，即「所有銀行轉型金融科技」及「為央行數碼貨幣（央行數碼貨幣）做好香港的未來準備」，主要旨在創造更多金融科技應用的需求。策略的其他部分則涉及數據、基建、人才與資源，這些對於生態系統的發展至關重要。\n\n根據此策略，我們推出一系列新措施，例如粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）金融科技測試工具，讓金融機構和科技公司能夠進行試點，並從監管機構和用戶獲得對跨境金融科技計劃的早期反饋；以及啟動商業數據通的試點，利用替代數據促進中小企貸款。我們亦加強了對批發層面央行數碼貨幣應用於跨境支付的研究，並探討數碼港元的前景，以提升香港在採用央行數碼貨幣方面的準備，並為我們的金融基建在未來數十年內做好充分準備。\n\n在善用科技發展帶來的新機會的同時，我們亦繼續鞏固現有的成就，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，2018年推出的轉數快系統，近年來發展迅速，截至2021年底，登記數目已達960萬，按年增長40%。平均每日交易量亦由2020年上升90%，2021年達到約673,000筆即時交易。同時，鑒於加密資產，特別是與支付相關的穩定幣迅速發展，我們今年早些時候已發佈諮詢文件，以邀請市場就制定適當的監管框架提供意見。\n\n我們的全新、具前瞻性的策略將為金融科技生態圈的健康發展奠定基礎。隨著銀行業日益採用金融科技以把握其所提供的機遇，這最終將惠及金融機構及香港市民，同時強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直扮演著戰略角色，連接內地市場與金融市場，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，從事各種金融、投資及財富管理活動。十四五規劃綱要強化了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及風險管理中心的地位。 加上全球經濟趨勢，我們更加堅信香港應繼續發揮連接內地與國際市場的獨特作用。\n\n2021年，我們在提升連通性方面取得顯著進展，新增了兩項重要成員加入我們的「通」計劃家族，分別是大灣區的跨境理財通（跨境理財通）計劃，以及債券通下的南向通，從此基本完成了股票、債務及財富管理等廣泛金融市場的雙向循環。這兩項計劃的推出將為香港帶來各方面的新機遇。透過滿足內地投資者日益多元化的需求，這兩項計劃將擴大我們的債券市場及財富管理業的客戶群。我很高興看到這兩項計劃運作順利。金管局將繼續與內地當局合作，隨著時間推移，進一步完善這些計劃。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2021\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nIn 2021, the Hong Kong economy resumes positive growth on the back of strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures.

經濟與金融環境\n\n2021年，香港經濟在貨物出口強勁、本地需求復甦以及政府相關政策措施的帶動下，恢復正增長。勞工市場亦有所改善，雖然通脹略有上升，但仍維持溫和水平。\n\n香港銀行業持續穩健，資本和流動性水平充裕。資產質素維持健康水平，符合國際標準及歷史指標。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n港元市場持續穩步有序運作，儘管仍有新冠病毒疫情的不確定性，以及市場對美國收緊貨幣政策步調的擔憂。聯繫匯率制度持續運作良好。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n隨著2021年環球金融市場開始復甦，外匯基金錄得投資收入達港元191.9億元，相當於4.1%的投資回報率。\n\n金管局持續推動負責任投資及資產多元化。長期增長組合自2009年起，年化內部回報率達15.4%。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局加強對銀行風險管理的監管。鑒於網絡威脅不斷升級以及數碼化加速，金管局已加強對銀行運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力的監管。銀行專業操守準則亦已修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n經過廣泛諮詢，粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通業務試點順利啟動。金管局就銀行透過非面對面方式提供投資及保險產品，發布指引，確保在顧客友善的同時，亦能提供適當保障。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集 (AML\/CFT) 方面，金管局的首要重點是進一步提升銀行預防及偵測疫情期間因網上金融罪行增加而引發的不法資金流動的能力。金管局亦積極推動公私營夥伴關係，促進訊息共享，並支持遙距開戶，同時鼓勵業界應用包括網絡分析在內的各項技術，藉此推出首個反洗錢合規科技實驗室。\n\n在軟實力領域持續加強努力，包括銀行文化和人才發展。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面已取得良好進展，包括資本充足水平和資訊披露。金管局亦積極推進處置標準的制定、處置規劃及發展處置執行能力，以確保銀行擁有可信的處置機制。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n金管局推出其「金融科技2025」策略，以促進金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。在轉數快系統方面，其登記數目和交易量均顯著增長，使用率持續擴展。\n\n在提升連通性方面，跨境理財通及債券通下的南向通已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色。\n\n亦致力於創造新的商業機會，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等領域。\n\n為促進香港金融服務，金管局加強市場外展，向各持份者介紹香港金融體系的抗震能力以及其發展前景。金融學院亦推出新的金融領袖計劃，旨在啟發香港未來的金融領袖。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7 operations":["每日24小時無間斷運作"],"80%

2022年及以後的優先事項\n\n全球及本地情況在2022年初顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢的升級以及美國聯邦儲備局加息的預期，導致市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟受到新冠病毒疫情新一波的影響。然而，香港金融體系憑藉多年來累積的抗震能力及緩衝，仍能穩健應對不利衝擊。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。為達此目標，我們將積極識別前路的風險，並以靈活的方式作出回應。同時，金管局亦會尋找機會，以鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的領導地位。在這複雜的投資環境下管理外匯基金，金管局將繼續謹慎投資，並保持靈活性，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高度流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍然面臨重大不確定性。金管局將持續關注最新發展，謹慎防范潛在風險，以維護金融體系的抗震能力及穩定性，這對於持續提供關鍵金融服務，支持香港經濟至關重要。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警惕。\n\n展望未來，市場或會因多重不確定因素而出現較大波動。一方面，若美國聯邦儲備局持續加快貨幣政策正常化步伐，或會顯著收緊全球金融狀況，並增加全球的債務負擔。另一方面，自2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級以來，包括中美緊張關係在內的地緣政治因素持續高企，可能再次引發市場波動。更重要的是，隨著疫情持續演變，大規模封城措施的重啟風險依然存在，或導致環球供應鏈樽頸問題持續，並對全球增長及通脹構成負面影響。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來建立的抗震能力及緩衝，已具備應對不利衝擊的良好基礎。金管局亦擁有充足的能力、資源和承諾，以維護香港的金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切監察本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並隨時準備採取適當措施以維持香港的金融穩定。二零二二年的研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛在風險。與此同時，金管局持續的數碼化計劃將強化其監察能力，以支援對金融體系的全面監察及分析。\n\n# 維持銀行體系穩定\n\n隨著已發展市場收緊貨幣政策，以及疫情的影響持續，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預計仍將具有挑戰性。同時，快速的科技發展和數碼化為銀行業帶來了機遇與挑戰。面對不斷變化的金融環境，金管局致力於透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行應對衝擊的能力。另一方面，金管局亦會繼續提升和完善銀行監管架構與政策，並充分考慮國際標準和最佳做法。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n2022年，金管局將加強對銀行信用風險的監察，並採取主動措施確保整體風險水平受控。\n\n金管局亦會繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業經營狀況的影響，並與銀行及商業界別保持緊密對話，同時持續檢視各項紓困措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n隨著2022年5月新版《監管政策手冊》(SPM)「運作穩健性」模組的發布，金管局將持續與業界溝通，了解認可機構（AIs）在發展運作穩健性框架的進度。同時，金管局將加強銀行業的網絡防衛能力，透過跟進認可機構在《網絡防衛評估框架2.0》評估中發現的問題，並監督認可機構實施安全的三重數據備份。另一個重要的監管重點將是評估及應對認可機構日益依賴科技服務供應商所帶來的風險。\n\n在疫情期間累積了增強的數字化能力及廣泛的遠程工作經驗後，一些認可機構正計劃在正常營運的基礎上轉向混合工作模式。金管局將密切關注這一發展，並評估行業是否已充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n金管局將於2022年專注於監察認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。 具體而言，金管局將繼續監察認可機構在倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）各設定停止刊發前，過渡離剩餘設定的進展情況，這些設定將於2023年6月30日停止刊發。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n2022年，金管局（HKMA）在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）的工作將持續聚焦於透過訊息共享，加強對金融罪行的應對，並與反洗錢生態系統內的各持份者建立更緊密的合作關係。其他重點包括，利用增強的數據及監管科技（監管科技）能力，實施更廣泛的風險為本監管技巧，並推動銀行採用合規科技，包括交易監察系統。\n\n金管局亦會繼續與政府、銀行業及儲值支付工具（SVF）行業緊密合作，發佈更新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，協助業界應對新興風險。同時，亦會持續了解不斷演變的洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險，修改反洗錢法例及相關指引以配合國際標準，並與其他監管機構及國際標準制定組織保持主動交流。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n於2022年，金管局將對認可機構在財富管理及銷售證券、強積金（MPF）及其他投資及保險產品方面的行為進行現場審查及監察，重點關注粵港澳大灣區的跨境理財通計劃、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資相連長期保險產品。\n\n在與其他監管機構及銀行業保持緊密溝通的同時，金管局將就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售，提供進一步指引，涵蓋虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售保障型投資相連壽險，這是一類具有高水平保險保障的投資相連壽險產品新子類別。金管局、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局將共同推出喬裝客戶檢查計劃，以檢視中介機構在銷售合資格延期年金保單及可扣稅自願性供款的銷售實務。\n\n隨着跨境理財通順利推出，金管局將繼續與業界及相關監管當局合作，以優化該計劃。\n\n此外，金管局將展開準備工作，以監管認可機構的信託業務，根據新的監管政策手冊模組及新的營運守則。\n\n# 金融市場基建監管\n\n金管局將繼續根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基建的原則》（PFMI）1，以及支付及金融基建委員會（CPMI）發出的各項指引，促進其監察範圍內的金融市場基建（FMIs）的安全與效率。金管局將會根據最新的科技和市場發展，進一步完善金融市場基建的監察架構。\n\n金管局將與金融市場基建合作，確保其遵循基建原則，並適時進行及更新評估。此外，金管局將繼續參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織就基建原則實施情況的監測及評估工作。金管局亦將參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並根據市場及科技發展情況，配合國際慣例，加強其監管要求。金管局將與相關當局合作，在適當情況下進一步加強合作監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將持續完善及優化其銀行監管架構與政策，以考慮國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局將繼續完善資本框架，落實巴塞爾銀行監管委員會近年發布的標準，其中包括以下內容：\n\n銀行於基金的股權投資的資本要求（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日生效，並在立法會審閱後，配合2022年銀行業（資本）（修訂）規則同時實施。\n\n《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》（於2017年12月）、《市場風險最低資本規定》（2019年1月，2019年2月修訂）以及2020年7月的《信用估值調整風險架構》的目標性修訂，總稱為《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案。 這些方案規範了信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險和業務操作風險的資本處理方式，並引入出項下限規定，同時強化了槓桿比率框架。 銀行業（資本）規則（BCR）的修訂正與業界協商進行中，預計將於2023年7月1日起生效，作為最低要求（市場風險和信用估值調整風險除外）。\n\n鑒於銀行業（資本）規則對官方實體集中風險的資本處理方式旨在補充巴塞爾委員會的大額風險承擔框架，而該框架已透過銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則實施，金管局將建議同步修訂銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則及相關資本規則。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局將繼續就擬議的銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則修訂與業界及律政司協商，並與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的實施日期保持一致，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中修訂資本標準相關的新或修訂披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發布的「第三支柱披露要求－更新框架」及「修訂市場風險披露規定」。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發布「修訂槓桿比率披露規定」，以解決有關銀行在報告日期附近減少某些交易規模，以人為提高其槓桿比率，從而進行報告和公開披露的「粉飾櫥窗」行為。為實施這些新或修訂的披露規定，銀行業（披露）規則的相應修訂亦正在準備中，預期在香港實施的時間表將與相關修訂資本標準的時間表一致。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求及國際標準的發展，金管局計劃更新若干監管政策手冊（監管政策手冊），包括與《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中修訂的資本及披露標準相關的章節，例如「逆周期緩衝資本  實施方法」、「銀行帳內的利率風險」、「新股認購及股票孖展融資」及「壓力測試」。金管局亦會繼續就「行為守則」及「認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定」的監管政策手冊章節進行修訂，目標是在2022年內完成。 鑒於《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂，相關的營運守則及監管政策手冊章節，例如關於「大型風險敞口及風險集中」的CR-G-8，以及關於「對關聯方的風險敞口」的CR-G-9，將相應更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7 operations":["每日24小時無間斷運作"],"80% and 90% Guarantee Products":["八成及九成信貸擔保產品"],"A hub for

經濟與金融環境\n\n憑藉強勁的貨物出口、復甦的本地需求，以及政府相關政策措施的提振，香港經濟在2021年重拾正增長，扭轉了2019年和2020年所經歷的萎縮。勞工市場亦有所改善，通脹保持溫和，儘管略有上升。預期疫情第五波新冠病毒疫情消退後經濟復甦將持續，但其力度和速度仍受不確定性和風險影響，尤其與疫情及美國貨幣政策正常化有關的因素。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n在強勁的貨物出口及本地需求改善的帶動下，香港經濟於2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年及2020年的經濟收縮（表1及圖1）。私人消費因勞工市場狀況改善，以及政府消費券計劃的推動而恢復。整體投資支出亦隨著營商環境及前景的改善而回升。外部方面，香港全年貨物出口表現強勁，受益於全球經濟持續復甦。服務輸出則錄得溫和增長，反映區內貿易及貨物流量的活躍，以及跨境商業及金融活動的增強。總進口顯著上升，主要由於本地需求及轉口需求增加。淨出口方面，對外貿易對實質本地生產總值（GDP）增長貢獻良多（圖1），總出口增長速度快於進口。\n\n表1 開支項目實質本地生產總值增長（期對期）\n\n注意：本地固定資本形成總額的經季節性調整的...按季增減幅度目前沒有提供。資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在當年小幅上升，但整體保持溫和。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，核心通脹率逐漸上揚，至12月達到輕微的1.4%（見圖表2）。隨著本地消費需求改善，外出用餐、交通、服裝及鞋履等消費項目價格重新恢復上漲動能。同時，全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源和商品價格上升，也導致進口價格明顯增加。相比之下，租金項目對整體通脹構成拖累，反映早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金下跌的傳導效應（見圖表2）。更廣泛而言，名義工資及商業樓宇租金的緩慢增長有助於控制國內企業成本壓力。整體而言，2021年核心通脹率與整體通脹率分別為0.6%及1.6%，均保持溫和水平。\n\n圖表 2 基本消費者物價通脹\n來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，勞工市場在2021年有所改善。失業率在2月達到近17年來的高點7.2%後，在12月明顯下降至4.0%（圖3），並在大多數行業呈現下降趨勢。總就業人數（圖3）和私營機構職位空缺的增加，反映出勞動需求逐漸增強，儘管這些指標仍低於疫情前的峰值。另一方面，與去年同期相比，勞動人口在12月略為減少1.3%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率出現小幅下降。名義工資與勞工收入的年增長，雖然溫和，但在2021年前三個季度顯示出加速跡象，扭轉了2019–2020年間的減速趨勢。\n\n圖表3 勞工市場狀況\n來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在年內表現疲軟，儘管部分主要海外股票市場持續上漲（圖表 4）。 恒生指數延續2020年末的反彈，於2021年2月17日升至31,085點的高位，但其後因多項因素影響，市場氣氛急轉為負面，包括對新冠病毒新變異株的擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及透過南向通的資金流入減少。 恒生指數以23,398點收市，較去年同期顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n圖表4 資產價格\n來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n2021年上半年，住宅物業市場在經濟前景改善的帶動下重拾上行動能，但下半年因資產市場情緒轉弱而出現一些調整（圖4）。整體而言，2021年樓價和成交量分別錄得3.7%和24.1%的增長。置業負擔能力也變得更加吃力，部分反映了家庭住戶入息減少。另一方面，經歷了2019年和2020年的大幅調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍有所改善，工廠物業的租金普遍回升至疫情前的水平，而零售及寫字樓物業的租金則仍低於各自的水平。\n\n請參閱表B：主要經濟指標，第326至327頁，以了解更多詳情，包括2017年至2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，本地新型冠狀病毒感染第五波疫情對本港經濟活動造成壓力。為應對當前情況，政府在2022至23年度財政預算案內推出第五及第六輪防疫抗疫基金，並採取額外逆周期措施以支持經濟。金管局亦與銀行界合作，將預先批核還息不還本計劃延長至2022年10月底。\n\n整體而言，預計2022年的經濟將持續復甦，但相較於2021年，增長步伐將會較為溫和，部分原因在於第五波新冠病毒疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、基數效應較為不利，以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年實質本地生產總值增長將介於1%至2%之間，而國際組織及私人分析師的最新增長預測平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的力度與速度仍受到多項不確定因素和風險的影響，特別是疫情、烏克兰局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的方向。\n\n# 通膨與勞工市場\n\n在進口價格上漲及疫情引發的物流中斷的影響下，預計近期通脹壓力將會小幅上升，但由於租金走軟及本地勞工成本壓力較輕，整體通脹率應大致受控。市場共識預計2022年整體通脹率為2.4%，而政府則預計整體通脹率及核心通脹率分別為2.1%及2.0%。本地新冠病毒第五波疫情在2022年初對勞工市場造成壓力，特別是面對面接觸的行業。展望未來，勞工市場狀況將取決於疫情發展及本地經濟復甦的進度。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年繼續保持穩定。總體銀行體系資產適度增加，貸款和存款均有所上升。銀行業的資本和流動性水平依然穩健。資產質素維持在健康水平，符合歷史及國際標準。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2021年增長了1.9%。受經濟復甦推動，貸款總額當年增長了3.8%，較2020年的1.2%有所提高。其中，香港的貸款增長了4.4%，香港以外地區的貸款增長了1.1%，貿易融資則增加了14.2%。內地相關的貸款在2021年擴張了3.6%，而在2020年則基本保持穩定。\n\n在負債方面，2021年存款總額上升了4.6%，與2020年的5.4%相比。由於存款總額的增長速度快於貸款總額，截至2021年末，整體貸存比率小幅下降至71.8%，較一年前的72.3%有所降低（圖5）。\n\n圖表 5 銀行業的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行業的資本狀況保持良好。於2021年底，本地註冊的認可機構的綜合總資本比率為20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖表6）。 兩項比率均遠高於各自的國際最低要求，分別為8%和6%。\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率在2021年底為7.9%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況穩健。第一類機構在2021年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋比率（流動性覆蓋比率）為151.9%，遠高於預期。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的25%（圖8）。\n\n圖表 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：金管局。\n\n銀行業的資金來源保持穩定。截至2021年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低要求的100%。核心資金來源也保持穩定。\n\n類別2A機構的核心資金比率於2021年底為150.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的75%（圖9）。\n\n圖表 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n資料來源：金管局。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n資產質素在年內保持穩定，並符合歷史及國際標準的健康水平。截至2021年底，特定分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略為下降，而逾期及經重組貸款比率則由0.57%微降至0.56%（圖表10）。與內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率，截至2021年底為0.86%，較2020年底的0.96%有所下降。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然維持在低水平，分別為0.04%及0.20%（圖表11）。金管局將繼續密切監察銀行業資產質素的變化。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境持續影響銀行業的盈利能力。2021年，零售銀行的除稅前經營溢利下降19.8%（圖12），主要由於淨利息收入減少（-13.6%）及總經營開支增加（+7.1%）。這些影響在一定程度上被費用及佣金收入增加（+9.6%）及貸款減值撥備減少（-25.1%）所抵銷。淨息差進一步收窄至2021年的0.98%，較2020年的1.18%有所下降（圖13）。\n\n零售銀行的成本與收入比率於2021年升至54.7%，較2020年的47.0%（圖14）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23

目標\n\n香港的貨幣政策首要目標是貨幣穩定。此定義是指香港貨幣相對於美元的匯率，在外匯市場上維持在港元7.75至7.85兌一美元的區間內。貨幣體系的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少由外匯基金持有的美元儲備 100% 支撐，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n負債證明書，為三家發鈔銀行所發行銀行紙幣提供十足擔保；政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；總結餘，即存放在金管局的結算戶口結餘；以及金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性透過自動利率調節機制，以及金管局堅定履行兌換保證的承諾來維持。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發時，金管局隨時準備以每美元7.75（或7.85）港元的匯率，向銀行買入（或賣出）港元，總結餘將擴張（或收縮），以壓低（或推高）港元利率，從而將港元匯率推回至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受股票相關需求驅動，主要源於集資活動及南向「港股通」，年初時港元匯率接近兌換範圍的強方水位。其後，由於股市調整及部分新上市企業回購新股集資資金，港元一度走弱，但因公司派息需求及南向「港股通」的淨流入，第二季略為回升。進入下半年，雖然市場氣氛轉淡，港元仍大致維持在兌換範圍的強方一側，並持續以平穩有序的方式交易（圖表1）。總體而言，2021年港元匯率市場運作正常。\n\n圖表1 2021年市場匯率\n\n由於沒有觸發兌換保證，截至2021年，總結餘及未償外匯基金票據及債券的總額約為港元1,526.3億，幾乎沒有變化（圖2）。年內，金管局共發行了港元80億額外外匯基金票據，以應對銀行體系流動性高企情況下銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，導致總結餘從2020年底的港元457.5億收縮至2021年底的港元377.5億。\n\n反映根據既定慣例發行額外外匯基金票據及發行外匯基金票據及債券以吸收外匯基金票據及債券的利息支付，當年外匯基金票據及債券的未償餘額由港元1,069.2億增至港元1,148.8億。貨幣基礎總體上仍然得到充分的外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 港元1,526.3億\n\n總結餘及尚餘外匯基金票據及債券\n\n圖表 2 總結餘（未計貼現窗）及 2021 年未償餘額外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在總結餘規模龐大下，香港銀行同業拆息全年維持在低水平並大致穩定（圖表3）。雖然首季因IPO活動增加，對港元的總結餘需求上升，但不同期限的香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）波動不大。其後，即使面對美國收緊貨幣政策的擔憂，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致穩定。至2021年底，香港銀行同業拆息出現輕微上升，部分反映年底預期的資金需求。在零售方面，銀行維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸在2021年由91億港元減少至68億港元。\n\n圖表 3 2021年香港元銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）是香港金融體系逾三十年的堅實支柱，並在面對各種挑戰時展現其抗震能力。儘管全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場持續有序運作，反映聯匯制度的穩健性。特區政府堅定支持聯匯制度。在2021年的對外部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，一套透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政架構，共同確保了聯匯制度的可信度。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續平穩運作，流動性水平及資本充足情況均遠遠超出國際標準。為確保銀行體系的抗震能力，金管局一直密切監控銀行對信用、流動性及利率風險的管理以及壓力測試結果，並維持其監管工作。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的特定部分撥出以支持貨幣基礎。2021年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.8–110.5%之間波動，未觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收於110.2%（圖4）。根據聯匯制度，雖然已指定特定的外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。外匯基金豐厚的財務資源，配合健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖表4 2021年支持比率的每日波動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發行委員會（CBC）監察及審視與香港的貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2021年，委員會審閱了多項議題，包括評估美國的通脹情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、「縮減恐慌」風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解內地相關的資金流對香港貨幣狀況的影響。委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交給委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已於金管局網站上公布。\n\n# 紙幣和硬幣\n\n截至2021年底，發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣總值為港元592.6億，較一年前上升5.9%（見圖表5、6及7）。截至2021年底，政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值為港元12.9億，按年上升1.7%（見圖表8及9）。\n\n# 港元5926億，+5.9%\n\n發鈔銀行所發行的銀行紙幣總價值\n\n# 港元129億，+1.7%\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣總價值\n\n# 圖表

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

銀行體系穩定\n\n香港銀行業在2021年仍保持穩健及穩定，儘管出現更具傳播力的新冠病毒變異株，對全球經濟復甦造成不確定性。當年，金管局持續專注於監督認可機構的風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加及銀行業數碼化加速，金管局亦加強了對認可機構運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力的監督。\n\n在操守監管，金管局向銀行提供指引，以促進投資及保險產品透過非面對面方式推廣，並與其他監管機構合作，就市場上新產品如保險相連證券及虛擬資產制定監管規定。同時，銀行業操守守則亦已修訂，以加強數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）方面，金管局的重點是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中的把關角色，以及其防止和偵測疫情期間因網上騙案、傀儡戶口網絡及其他金融犯罪而引發的不法資金流動的能力。為增加客戶帳戶免受詐騙及金融犯罪的保護，金管局透過公私營夥伴關係擴大了與其他相關方的合作及訊息共享。在支持遙距開戶的同時，金管局亦鼓勵採用其他科技，包括網絡分析，並於11月推出首個反洗錢合規科技實驗室。在國際上，積極發揮作用使金管局在財務行動特別組織的全球打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作中保持領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通業務試點於九月順利啟動。當年，金管局繼續執行其兩年計劃，推動香港合規科技的採用。為銀行業的氣候風險管理奠定基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色及可持續銀行業，金管局加強了相關工作，包括推廣以客戶為本的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作，透過措施培訓人才，促進人才發展。\n\n同時，金管局與銀行業密切合作，優化監管政策及程序。在落實國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足水平及披露相關標準。金管局持續推進工作，以確保認可機構有可信的處置機制，包括制定新的處置標準，並實施有關吸收虧損能力要求的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。要實現此目標，需要一個高度穩健的金融體系，為香港經濟提供關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作方式，可能影響系統的穩定性，而在極端情況下，甚至可能因應急而導致倒閉。作為監管機構，金融管理專員在確保銀行能抵禦衝擊並在危機中恢復其地位，從而協助維護金融穩定，最終有助於預防失敗。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構（AIs）。\n\n然而，金融管理專員無法確保，亦非香港審慎監管框架的設計目的，是要確保零風險的金融體系。相反，作為處置機制當局，金融管理專員旨在確保，一旦認可機構面臨無法持續經營的情況，其失敗能有序管理。為此，香港已建立針對金融機構的處置機制，其中金管局是認可機構及其他類型機構的處置機制當局。為在香港推行處置機制，制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除影響認可機構處置可行性的障礙，並提升金管局的運作能力以處理陷入困境的認可機構至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金管局亦負責指定及監察若干金融市場基建（FMIs）。在監察金融市場基建時，金管局旨在促進其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並提升透明度。增強金融市場基建對金融危機的韌性，有助於保護香港的貨幣及金融體系免受金融市場基建中斷可能引發的不穩定影響。有關金管局監察方法的資訊，可在金管局網站上查閱。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 發牌\n\n2021年底，香港是：\n\n年內，金管局向三間非本地銀行授出了兩張銀行牌照和一張有限制牌照銀行。金管局亦批准了一間外地交易平台營運機構成為貨幣經紀。年內，三間持牌銀行和兩間有限制牌照銀行的授權被撤銷。\n\n有關認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資料，請參閱附錄及第321至324頁的表D至F，以及第330至333頁的表D至F。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n金管局進行了189項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為金管局持續推動更強風險管治的其中一環，與認可機構的董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會舉行了40次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外聘核數師之間還舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除場外活動外，金管局亦定期進行現場審查，並配合專題評估，以評估風險較高的範疇。年內共進行了679項現場審查及專題評估，重點關注信用風險管理。隨著銀行對科技的應用日益普及，業務操作風險及科技風險的管理亦成為另一重要關注領域。金管局同時增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估。此外，專項審查小組亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務的活動，以及其打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（AML\/CFT）控制措施進行了現場審查及專題評估。表1總結了金管局2021年的監管活動。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質素\n\n貸款總額在2021年增加了3.8%，相比2020年的1.2%增長。表2顯示貸款及融資的細項。\n\n2021年，與內地相關的貸款增加3.6%至港元4,725億（見表3）。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在本年度大致保持穩定，並維持在歷史及國際標準下健康的水平。截至2021年底，特定分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自2000年起的長期平均水平1.8%。與內地相關貸款的比率亦較一年前的0.96%下降至0.86%。\n\n年內，新冠病毒疫情持續對經濟的某些領域造成壓力，同時內地房地產行業的信貸事件也引起市場關注。金管局擴展了監察的廣度和深度，重點深入審視銀行對高槓桿借款人的信用風險。金管局與銀行保持密切溝通，以協助進行經濟和市場發展影響的最新評估，以及銀行風險管理的充分性。整體而言，銀行業面臨的信用風險被評估為可控。金管局最新償債壓力測試的結果確認，銀行業持續保持足夠的資本緩衝，以應對極端壓力。\n\n本年度進行了有針對性和主題性的審查，以評估認可機構在貸款分類、貸款虧損準備金、海外貸款業務以及向私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款方面的系統和控制。\n\n# 緩解客戶的現金流壓力\n\n今年九月，金管局與銀行業中小企貸款協調機制宣布，將預先批核還息不還本計劃延長六個月，至2022年4月底。此計劃於2020年5月首次推出，旨在為企業客戶暫緩貸款本金六個月。鑒於本地新型冠狀病毒疫情再度出現，2022年2月，該計劃進一步延長至2022年10月底。此外，該計劃亦已優化，為財務能力較強且願意逐步恢復貸款本金償還的客戶，提供一年期的部分本金償還選擇。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准貸款展期及其他形式的應急貸款，涉及總金額超過9200億港元。針對個人客戶，銀行已批准超過52,000宗住宅按揭及其他個人應急貸款的本金還款假期，總金額超過530億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，金管局推出的多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已加強了銀行的風險管理，以及銀行業對本地物業市場可能出現急跌的抗震能力。2021年12月批出的新住宅按揭貸款（RMLs）的平均按揭成數為53%，相較於2009年9月首次推出逆周期措施前的64%有所下降。2021年12月新按揭的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）仍維持在36%的低水平，相較於2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%（圖1）。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n鑒於銀行日益依賴科技來支持其運作，金管局加強了對業務操作及科技風險的監管。年內的主要監管重點包括對外判予雲端服務及遙距工作安排的控制。金管局於十二月就《監管政策手冊》(SPM) 新章節〈運作穩健性〉展開業界諮詢。該新的SPM章節旨在為銀行提供指引，協助其建立全面且整合的運作穩健性綜合架構。\n\n金管局於一月推出了《網絡防衛評估框架2.0》，以反映網絡風險管理方面的最新良好做法。年內，金管局監察認可機構實施《網絡防衛評估框架2.0》，並審視其網絡防衛能力。鑒於破壞性網絡攻擊的風險不斷增加，金管局於五月要求所有認可機構審慎評估是否需要進行三重數據備份，並參考香港銀行公會（香港銀行公會）發布的《穩固三重數據備份指引》。\n\n為應對日益增加的風險及網絡釣魚攻擊，金管局與業界緊密合作，加強網上及流動銀行服務的安全性。一項大型聯合金管局及香港銀行公會的公眾意識宣傳活動，以「保護你的個人數碼鎖匙；謹防詐騙連結！」為主題，於七月開始（圖1）。\n\n圖一 提升公眾對網絡釣魚攻擊的意識\n\n「保護您的個人數碼鎖匙；謹防詐欺連結！」宣傳活動標語圖示\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n為加強監察認可機構的流動性風險，金管局在其流動性壓力測試框架中引入了額外情境，以評估認可機構應對長時間流動性衝擊的能力。\n\n年度內，金管局進行了專題評估，以評估認可機構的流動性壓力測試計劃是否足夠，並審查其監控指標及控制限額在管理流動性風險方面的表現。金管局亦進行了審查，評估認可機構在債券投資的市場風險管理架構，以及對財資業務的操作控制是否有效。\n\n金管局密切監察認可機構為轉離倫敦銀行同業拆息（倫敦銀行同業拆息）的進展。金管局與業內公會合作，並開發工具協助金融機構支持客戶轉移至備用參考利率，包括一份旨在提高企業對此轉移認識的簡介，以及一份說明貸款市場中可用於取代美元倫敦銀行同業拆息的選項的資訊文件。認可機構已大幅調整參考倫敦銀行同業拆息的合約，這些利率已於2021年底停止發佈。他們亦被提醒自2022年1月1日起不得簽訂新的倫敦銀行同業拆息合約。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

國際金融中心\n\n在2021年，金管局透過多管齊下的方式，推進香港作為國際金融中心的全球競爭力。\n\n金管局推出「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融業廣泛採用金融科技，並鞏固香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。在新冠病毒疫情期間，轉數快系統的交易量顯著上升。\n\n在提升連通性方面，今年取得了重大進展，新增了跨境財富管理通及債券通下的南向通，完善了內地與海外市場之間的一系列互聯互通安排。憑藉世界一流的市場基礎設施和這些互聯互通安排，香港成為內地資金參與全球市場，以及國際投資者進入快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n此外，在2021年，金管局致力於創造新的商機，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，重點領域包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心以及綠色和可持續金融。為推廣香港的金融服務，金管局加強了對海外及內地相關方的市場推廣，向他們介紹香港金融體系的穩健性及其所呈現的發展前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極參與國際和區域的中央銀行及監管組織，致力於維持金融穩定和促進市場發展。\n\n# 概述\n\n金管局宣布其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列舉措以促進金融科技的廣泛採用，並鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。 金管局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門合作，在今年推動多項關鍵舉措，包括以下內容：\n\n推動合規科技的應用\n推行金融科技應用評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的應用情況。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位依然穩固，離岸人民幣業務在當年實現了強勁增長。隨著在岸證券持續被納入主要金融市場指數，資金流入人民幣資產的速度不斷加快。香港在協助國際投資者增加配置人民幣資產方面發揮不可或缺的作用，內地與香港之間各個互聯互通平台被廣泛視為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場的首選渠道。2021年，北向債券通的日均交易量增加34%，達到約人民幣258億元。\n\n在北向債券通取得成功後，南向債券通於9月推出，完成了內地與國際債市的雙向連接。同月，中國人民銀行（人民銀行）、金管局及澳門金融管理局頒佈《跨境理財通（跨境理財通）方案的實施細則》於大灣區（大灣區）。10月，香港合資格銀行開始與內地合作銀行共同提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為離岸人民幣中心的作用，金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成工作小組，研究如何在香港推廣人民幣計價股票交易的可行性。此外，中國人民銀行（人民銀行）與金管局於十二月合辦研討會，藉此展示香港作為國際金融中心及領先的人民幣業務樞紐。\n\n金管局持續取得進展，以提升香港金融平台的競爭力。特別是，為提升香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業密切合作，為基金設立提供更有利的稅務及監管環境。在進一步提升香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐及發債中心的地位方面，也取得重大進展。同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n安全且高效的金融基建運作，對於鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位至關重要。 2021年，四間銀行間即時支付結算、債務工具中央結算系統以及香港交易資料儲存庫均達至100%的系統可供使用率，表現優於99.95%的目標。 隨著九月南向債券通的推出，CMU系統成為北向及南向債券通交易的結算及託管服務。\n\n於2021年，轉數快的使用持續擴展。年底登記數目增至960萬，年度平均每日交易量較2020年上升90%。使用轉數快支付政府帳單、商戶支付以及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值，加上個人對個人和企業支付的穩定增長，是成交量持續上升的主要動力。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局監察六個指定零售支付系統，並根據支付系統及儲值支付工具條例（支付條例）對十五個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監察。本年度，金管局協調各相關政府部門，並促進行業與儲值支付工具持牌人之間，就政府電子消費券計劃的對話及合作，以確保該計劃的順利推行。\n\n2022年1月，金管局發佈《加密資產及穩定幣討論文件》，闡述金管局對相關監管制度的考慮，並徵求利益相關方的意見。制定適當的監管制度時，將納入考慮相關因素，包括對此討論文件的反饋及相關國際組織的建議。\n\n國際上，金管局是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。例如，金管局主持金融市場工作小組（WGFM），該工作小組是根據東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議（EMEAP）2成立的。金管局同時亦共同主持巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的政策及標準小組、非銀行監察專家小組以及金融穩定理事會（金融穩定理事會）的金融創新網絡，並領導一個團隊研究與金融基準過渡相關的監管問題。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n六月，金管局發布其「金融科技2025」策略，以推動香港的金融科技發展。該策略旨在促使金融服務行業於2025年前全面採用科技，同時促進提供公平及高效的金融服務，以惠及香港市民及經濟。該策略的五大重點領域為：\n\n所有銀行都轉型金融科技\n為香港未來佈局央行數碼貨幣\n打造數據基建\n擴展金融科技人才庫\n以資金與政策培育生態系統\n\n金管局的「金融科技2025」策略推動香港金融科技的發展\n\n# 金融科技應用在銀行業\n\n為配合「金融科技2025」策略的「所有銀行都採用金融科技」倡議，金管局於2021年6月推出金融科技應用評估。 評估旨在協助金管局更深入了解銀行業現時的金融科技發展情況，並識別金管局可能需要提供支持的金融科技領域。 所有持牌銀行（於香港有重要業務）均被要求於2021年底前制定應用金融科技的3年計劃。\n\n年內，金管局亦繼續推行其兩年計劃，以推動香港銀行採用合規科技，並在其監管過程中應用科技，以提高效率和效能。詳見《銀行體系穩定》章節第98頁。\n\n# 批發央行數碼貨幣\n\n金管局與泰國央行於2021年2月擴展了其聯合研究項目，並加入了阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及人民銀行數碼貨幣研究院。該項目後更名為「多央行數碼貨幣橋（mBridge）」，並獲得國際結算銀行（BIS）香港創新樞紐中心的大力支持。項目進一步探討分散式賬本技術，以促進多司法管轄區環境下，全天候實時跨境外匯交易同步交收（PvP）交易。2021年9月發表了一份聯合報告，匯報了中期發現，隨後於11月發布潛在應用場景及未來發展藍圖。\n\n# 零售央行數碼貨幣\n\n為在香港央行數碼貨幣準備方面做好未來防備，金管局已開始研究在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即數碼港元）的可行性，涵蓋技術及政策考慮。金管局與國際結算銀行創新樞紐中心（香港）合作，展開名為 Project Aurum 的研究，以探討發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣的技術層面。 另外，成立了一個內部跨部門工作小組，研究相關的技術、政策及法律問題。十月份，金管局發布了一份名為《數碼港元：技術視角》的白皮書，旨在探討並邀請對發行及分發零售層面央行數碼貨幣潛在技術設計方案的意見。\n\n此外，金管局支持人民銀行數字貨幣研究所就使用數字人民幣進行跨境支付的技術試點。這有助於推動大灣區的互聯互通，並通過提升跨境支付的效率和用戶體驗，為香港與內地遊客帶來更大便利。\n\n# 商業數據通\n\n七月，金管局舉辦一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行及儲值支付工具營運商加入商業數據通，這是一項下一代金融數據基礎設施，旨在提升銀行體系內的金融中介效率。為進一步推動發展，研討會上宣布啟動商業數據通創新樞紐。為促進中小企業融資，金管局已完成兩階段的概念驗證研究，探討商業數據通的技術可行性。研究期間，參與銀行運用替代數據以協助信貸評估及貸款承保，共批准逾550筆中小企業貸款，總額超過9億港元。基於積極的結果，金管局於十一月宣布啟動商業數據通的試點啟動。\n\n中小企業主讚揚商業數據通簡化了貸款申請流程。\n\n# 人才發展\n\n為擴展金融科技人才庫，金管局繼續與其策略夥伴合作推行金融科技人才培育計劃升級版，以培育不同職業發展階段的年輕人才。2021年，超過180名學生受惠於該計劃。另外，金融科技先鋒聯網計劃於9月試行，為修讀金融科技碩士學位的學生提供參與真實金融科技項目的機會。為建立策略夥伴關係並促進包括金融科技人才培育等領域的合作，金管局於10月與四所本地大學簽訂諒解備忘錄。\n\n鮑嘉麟先生（中），金管局助理總裁（金融基建），於與四所本地大學簽署諒解備忘錄儀式上。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）的使用量在年內持續上升。截至2021年12月底，自2016年推出以來，共有234項金融科技計劃獲准在FSS進行試點，較2020年底的193項有所增加。截至2021年12月底，金管局自2017年推出FSS聊天室以來，共收到666宗申請，希望在金融科技項目初期階段透過聊天室取得監管意見。超過63%的聊天室申請來自科技公司。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit

儲備管理\n\n環球金融市場在2021年開始復甦。儘管全球經濟持續受到新冠病毒疫情的影響，但多項因素，包括疫苗接種率的上升以及全球各地的貨幣政策和財政措施，都有助於全球經濟和金融市場的顯著復甦。在此背景下，多個海外股票市場在當年創下歷史新高，而外匯基金的整體股票持倉即使在港股表現疲弱的情況下，也能實現可觀的回報。2021年，外匯基金錄得投資收入港元1,919億，投資回報率為4.1%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n外匯基金的主要目標，如《外匯基金條例》所載，是直接或間接影響港元匯價。基金亦可用來維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定，以協助維護香港作為國際金融中心。金管局在財政司司長授權下，須就外匯基金的管理及投資運用向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已為外匯基金訂立以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 維持資本；\n(ii) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高流動性的美元資產支持；\n(iii) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(iv) 在符合(i)至(iii)的前提下，實現投資回報，以幫助維持外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已融入基金的組合架構及目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資組合類別\n\n廣泛來說，外匯基金主要由兩個主要資產組合構成：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流動的美元計價資產，旨在依照貨幣發行局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分保障。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以確保其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，金管局以謹慎且漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產投資。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。金管局自開展投資以來，已設有市值上限以控制進入長期增長組合的多元化進度。隨著長期增長組合在投資規模及資產類別方面日益成熟，外匯基金諮詢委員會於2022年1月決定，以目標資產配置取代市值上限，該目標資產配置將與其他資產類別同時確定，並遵循謹慎的風險管理原則。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年成立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，這些股份是由政府為外匯基金購入，以策略性目的。由於其獨特性，策略性資產組合未納入基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受來自財政儲備存款、政府基金及法定組織的存款。利率一般與投資組合的表現相關，主要例外是未來基金，其利率則根據組合比重，與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報率掛鈎。 2021年，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合之間的組合比重約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置的決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰略性配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表外匯基金的投資目標所決定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰略性配置，以嘗試超越投資基準的回報。這意味著實際配置經常與基準（或策略性）配置不同。「戰略性偏離」是指實際配置與基準配置之間的差異。雖然投資基準和追蹤誤差限制由財政司司長諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後決定，但戰略性決策以及可容許的戰略性偏離範圍則由金管局在授權下制定和設定。在允許的戰略性偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可以採取 позиции 以利用短期市場波動（圖 2）。\n\n圖2 外匯基金資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室負責其投資及相關風險管理功能。該辦公室的員工直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括全部支持組合及部分投資組合。此部分投資組合包括一組投資於全球定息市場的資產組合，以及各種衍生工具，用於實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除內部管理資產外，金管局聘請外聘投資經理管理外匯基金約 29% 的資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他資產類別。聘請外聘投資經理的目的是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，借助多樣化且互補的投資風格，並獲取投資方面的市場見解及專業技術知識。\n\n與使用外聘投資經理有關的支出包括基金管理、託管費、交易費以及扣繳及其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。金管局為內部及外部管理的資產組合設立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並確保風險監察及合規制度完善。三重防線已到位，以有效實施風險管理及投資相關活動的治理。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及業務操作風險）會定期監測，而風險管理程序則提供穩健的架構，以支持戰略規劃及投資分散化。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局認為，透過適當強調負責任投資及可持續長期表現，可以更好地實現外匯基金的投資目標，並降低與其基礎投資的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關事宜所帶來的風險。金管局支持負責任投資，透過將ESG因素融入外匯基金公眾及私募市場投資的投資流程來實踐。其指導原則是，一般而言，若經風險調整長期收益可與其他投資相近，則優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局負責任投資框架及落實的更多詳情，請參閱第184至191頁的可持續長期表現章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2021年金融市場\n\n全球股市在超寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施推動下急升並創下新高，帶動全球經濟和金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港和內地股市表現遜色，而美國標準普爾500指數上漲27%，香港恒生指數則下跌14%。\n\n對債市而言，通膨預期上升以及美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）資產收購減碼，導致2021年美國國債收益率上升，且債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率從年初的0.9%上升至年底的1.5%，增幅約為60基點。\n\n在貨幣市場，美元兌其他主要貨幣走強，尤其是在2021年底，由於市場對美聯儲縮減購債規模的預期。特別是，歐元和日圓分別對美元貶值7.1%和10.3%。\n\n表一顯示了2021年主要貨幣、債市及股市的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2021年錄得投資收入達1919億港元。 該項收入包括債券收益126億港元、權益淨收益478億港元（其中外國股票收益688億港元，港股虧損210億港元）、非港元資產的匯兌效果為正，達168億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益1147億港元。 另外，策略性資產組合錄得估值收益31億港元。\n\n外匯基金的總資產於年底達致港元4,570.2億。長期增長組合的投資市值總額為港元515.3億，其中私募股權為港元392.5億，物業則為港元122.8億。長期增長組合的已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為港元225.7億。\n\n外匯基金在2021年的投資回報率（不計策略性資產組合）為4.1%。其中，投資組合的回報率為3.7%，支持組合則增長了0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年以來，已錄得內部回報率年率為15.4%。\n\n外匯基金自1994年至2021年的年度回報請參見圖1。表2呈現了2021年的投資回報，以及該基金在不同時間段的平均投資回報。2019年至2021年間的平均回報為5.3%，2017年至2021年間為4.7%，2012年至2021年間為3.3%，自1994年以來則為4.8%。表3列出了截至2021年12月31日，基金資產的貨幣構成。\n\n請參閱第211至319頁，以了解外匯基金經審核的2021年財務報表。\n"}

Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"12-month expected credit losses":["12個月預期信用虧損"],"2022–23 Budget":["2022至23年度財政預算案"],"24\/7

機構職能\n\n機構職能以高透明度、責任、效率及專業水準支援金管局的運作。為促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通。在機構內，金管局致力建立靈活可持續的人力資源，實施嚴謹的財政紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以適應變化並確保其政策及措施的有效落實。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度及促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。 2021年，金管局舉辦或參與了169場實體及虛擬活動，包括八場記者會、八場即場訪問及153場其他公眾活動。另外安排了27場傳媒訪問。全年共發佈了632份雙語新聞發佈稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對金管局主要職能的認知，金管局為本地、內地及外國媒體舉辦了記者會及媒體簡報會。主題包括Connect 計劃、金融科技及利率基準改革。\n\n為及時與公眾溝通互動，金管局維持五個社交媒體渠道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube），擁有超過80,000名關注者。金管局利用其社交媒體渠道，提高公眾對多項議題的認識，特別是網絡釣魚騙案，該問題在疫情期間顯著增加。此外，金管局亦透過社交媒體進行廣泛的推廣活動，內容涵蓋綠色金融、金融科技及Connect 計劃，以讓公眾掌握最新發展趨勢。\n\n金管局總裁余偉文在香港金融科技周2021主持虛擬討論小組。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁李浩然主持一場關於「金融科技2025」策略的媒體簡報會。\n\n金管局副總裁袁家禮主持媒體簡報會，介紹香港銀行業為倫敦銀行同業拆息轉換所做的準備。\n\n劉逸明先生，金管局副總裁，接受國際新聞頻道訪問。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一個有效途徑，以更好地了解金管局的主要職能及運作情況。2021年，該服務共處理了9,781宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢與銀行業政策及規例、銀行消費者事宜、紙幣及硬幣，以及金融基建和債券市場發展相關。硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行業相關的指引與通告，以及零售債券發行計劃，都是其中較受歡迎的查詢項目。\n\n圖一顯示自2018年以來收到的公共查詢數量，圖二則提供了2021年按查詢性質的細分。\n\n圖表 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖表 2 2021 年接獲諮詢性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了金管局《年報》外，金管局亦發佈了兩期《貨幣與金融穩定情況半年度報告》及四期《季報》，並定期更新《金融數據月報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊及分析。金管局同時亦發布了11篇 inSight1 文章，介紹其主要的新舉措及政策，並討論香港關注的時事議題。\n\n金管局《年報》2020年在香港管理專業協會2021年最佳年報評選中，於「非牟利及慈善機構」類別獲得銀獎，並在環境、社會及管治匯報類別獲得卓越獎。\n\n# 機構網站\n\n機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過四萬四千頁的內容，以英文、繁體中文和簡體中文呈現，是公眾獲取金管局最新資訊的入口。網站內載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條規定的認可機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處名冊，以及認可機構的證券業務員工紀錄冊。此外，網站還提供根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的儲值支付工具持牌人名冊。\n\n金管局自2018年起已分階段透過開放應用程式介面（API）於其網站上發布金融數據及重要資訊。截至2021年底，金管局已在其網站上開放148組開放API，符合既定時間表。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n金管局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社會介紹金管局的工作，並推廣公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識的重要設施。中心設有展覽區和圖書館。展覽區以互動方式呈現金管局的工作內容，以及香港的貨幣和銀行業發展歷程。這裡還展示了與香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務相關的資料和展品。圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過26,000冊關於香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務，以及中央銀行議題的書籍、期刊和其他出版物。此外，圖書館亦根據《銀行業條例》第20條的規定，備存認可機構及本地代表辦事處的紀錄冊，以及認可機構證券業務員工紀錄冊，供公眾查閱。\n\n為保障公眾健康與安全，新冠病毒疫情期間，資訊中心實施了特別的運作安排。清潔與消毒工作加強，並定期使用長效殺菌塗層為設施及展品消毒。\n\n金管局資訊中心轄下展覽館設有「政策」展區、「貨幣」展區及「歷史長廊」。\n\n# 社區參與與公眾教育\n\n為接觸社區並提高公眾對金管局工作的認識，一項公眾教育講座自1998年起持續舉辦。2021年，金管局為來自84間中學的逾2,300名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。研討會內容包括金管局的工作概覽、聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、個人數碼鎖匙的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的就業機會。截至目前為止，已有超過63,000人參與了公眾教育講座。\n\n金管局致力教育市民，並鼓勵市民成為負責任的金融服務消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚騙案有所增加，金管局舉辦了一項以「保護你的個人數碼鎖匙；提防虛假的超連結！」為主題的公眾教育活動，並透過多媒體宣傳，呼籲公眾時刻警惕嵌入簡訊和郵件中，據稱來自銀行的虛假的超連結。\n\n跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾謹防虛假的超連結。\n\n金管局亦致力加強公眾對金融業的了解，並提升年輕一代在該行業發展事業的興趣。繼2020年網上劇集《STEPS》獲得正面回響後，金管局推出全新系列《中環4型人格》，介紹金融業四大發展領域：數據科學、金融科技、綠色和可持續金融，以及財富管理。在該視頻系列中，市場從業者的角色以幽默方式呈現，資深業界人士與年輕人才分享有關上述領域的工作性質與要求、職業機會及前景的經驗。\n\n《中環4型人格》系列讓年輕一代隨時掌握金融市場的發展動態。\n\n「網上親子理財教育活動」於2020年推出，並在2021年The MarketingEvents Awards的「Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility」組別中獲得了銀獎。為延續活動的成功並保持勢頭，金管局推出了更多措施，包括親子理財工作坊，邀請兒童教育專家分享如何教導孩子建立良好的理財觀念，並示範一款自製理財教育玩具，以及金管局資訊中心的動畫虛擬導覽。\n\n「網上親子理財教育活動」榮獲2021年行銷活動大獎。此活動旨在向家長和孩子推廣理財觀念和技能，讓他們在輕鬆有趣的氛圍中學習。\n\n為提升中學生的財務素養，金管局與各方攜手合辦「全港理財爭霸戰」，活動以金融科技為主題。除了網上測驗外，更加入了一項關於個人理財的設計思維工作坊，旨在訓練參與學生構思創新的理財工具方案。此舉榮獲教育局「商校合作計劃」頒發的「最高學生參與獎」，以及投委會（IFEC）頒發的「投資者及理財教育獎（企業）—

{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n","terms":{"12-month

可持續發展\n\n金管局現正發佈其首份可持續發展報告，作為其2021年年度報告的重要組成部分，以闡述其可持續發展策略，並記錄自身努力以及與金融業的合作，支持政府的氣候策略，為建設更具氣候應變能力及可持續發展的世界做出貢獻。\n\n金管局在履行主要職能和功能時，將可持續發展的因素融入考量之中，無論是作為銀行業監管機構、市場促進者、負責任投資者，還是維護金融及貨幣穩定。此外，金管局與本地及海外當局合作，加強氣候風險的管理與披露，並推動綠色和可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，金管局致力履行機構社會責任，並力求成為一個負責任且可持續的機構。這種承諾體現在多個方面，包括推廣可持續、普惠金融和環境友善的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境以及營造關懷的職場。\n\n# 概述\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最迫切挑戰之一。為了應對氣候變化，各國在巴黎協定下同意採取行動以減少溫室氣體排放，並在本世紀內最終實現碳中和。實現巴黎協定氣候變化目標，預計每年全球將需要投資 1 至 2 兆美元，使可持續發展成為未來幾十年資本流動驅動力之一。\n\n香港致力於在這項轉型中處於領導地位。特區政府宣布，將努力在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球先進經濟體系保持一致。香港亦是亞洲首個承諾於2025年前，在相關行業中將披露要求與氣候相關財務披露工作小組（TCFD）的建議對齊的司法管轄區。\n\n對金融業而言，氣候變化既是風險來源，也是機會。雖然金融業無法避免氣候變化帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金導向與降低溫室氣體排放及氣候韌性發展相符的活動。\n\n<think>\nAll six translations are remarkably similar, demonstrating a good understanding of the source text and the provided dictionary. However, there are subtle differences in phrasing and word choice that impact the overall fluency and naturalness.\n**Common Strengths:** All translations correctly incorporate the dictionary terms: '香港金融體系' for 'Hong Kong’s financial system', '金管局' for 'HKMA', and '可持續發展的因素' for'sustainability considerations'. They also generally maintain the original sentence structure and meaning.\n**Weaknesses and Specific Observations:**\n*   **\"致力於強化\" vs. \"致力加強\":** Several translators use \"致力於強化\" (zhì lì yú qiánghuà) while others use \"致力加強\" (zhì lì jiāqiáng). While both are acceptable, \"致力加強\" is slightly more concise and common in this context. \"致力於強化\" sounds a bit more formal and potentially overly emphatic.\n*   **\"特區政府\" vs. \"政府\":** Some use \"特區政府\" (Tèqū Zhèngfǔ - Special Administrative Region Government) while others use simply \"政府\" (Zhèngfǔ - Government). Given the context of Hong Kong, \"特區政府\" is more precise and appropriate.\n*   **\"做出貢獻\" vs. \"貢獻於\":** Both are correct, but \"貢獻於\" (gòngxiàn yú) flows slightly better in this context.\n*   **Sentence Flow and Conjunctions:** Some translations use slightly awkward phrasing, particularly in the transition between sentences. For example, \"在此過程中\" (in this process) in Translator 5 is a bit clunky. \"為此\" (wèi cǐ - for this reason) is a more natural connector.\n*   **\"運作\" vs. \"運營\":** Both mean \"operations,\" but \"運作\" (yùnzuò) is generally preferred when referring to the operations of an organization or institution.\n*   **\"已納入\" vs. \"納入\":** Translator 4 uses \"已納入\" (yǐ nàrù - has incorporated), which implies a completed action. The original English suggests an ongoing commitment, so \"納入\" (nàrù - incorporate) is more accurate.\n*   **\"更環保和更可持續發展的未來\" vs. \"更綠色和可持續的未來\":** While \"環保\" (húnbǎo - environmental protection) and \"綠色\" (lǜsè - green) are related, \"綠色\" aligns better with the original's emphasis on a \"greener\" future.\n**Proposed Improvements:**\nThe best translation should:\n1.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核《外匯基金》及其附屬機構（「本集團」）刊載於第217至319頁的《財務報表》，該《財務報表》包括《外匯基金》及本集團於2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及對《財務報表》的附註，其中包括重要的會計政策摘要。\n\n根據我的意見，財務報表真實及公正地反映了基金及集團截至2021年12月31日的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，且已根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒佈的行政長官指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我乃根據《外匯基金條例》第七條及審計署的審計準則，遵照行政長官的指示進行審計。我根據該等準則須承擔的責任，在我的報告中「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」一節中進一步闡述。我獨立於該集團，符合該等準則，並且已按照該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指在我對截至2021年12月31日止年度財務報表進行審計時，依我專業判斷最為重要的事項。這些事項係在我審計財務報表整體的過程中加以處理，並作為我形成意見的依據，我並未就這些事項另行提供意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債的公平值估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6和38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為港元4,502,475億元，金融負債總額為港元1,150,861億元，按公平值計量。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 89% 以及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值或為活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或使用基於可觀察市場數據的估值方法估計（第二級）。\n\n對於其餘 11% 的金融資產，其公允價值使用估值方法估計，該方法的輸入並非基於可觀察市場數據（第 3 層輸入）。這些金融資產總計港元 517,316 億元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n考量金額龐大且涉及估計，金融資產及金融負債按公平值計價為一重大審計事項。\n\n審計程序包括金融資產及金融負債以公平值之計量。\n\n了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的評估程序，包括相關控制措施；評估並測試電腦系統的控制措施，包括應用控制；取得關於金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在性、權利與義務及完整性的外部確認；若使用報價市場價格，則核實價格是否與獨立來源一致；若使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法，則評估估值方法之適當性及假設的合理性，並核實輸入數據是否來自獨立來源；若使用以非可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值方法，則評估估值方法之適當性及假設與輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業的公平值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公允價值計入，截至2021年12月31日總計為港元27,089億。集團亦持有一家聯營公司及二十一家合營企業的權益，總計為港元45,172億，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有，或由聯營公司或合營企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。有關估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所採用的假設。\n\n對投資物業以公平值作估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得並審閱本集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值乃基於估值報告中所述的估值；\n評估估值師的獨立性及資格；及\n評估估值方法的適當性以及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金融管理專員負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括金管局2021年年報內的所有資訊，除財務報表及我的審計報告外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我對此不作鑒證結論。\n\n在審計財務報表時，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估這些資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大錯誤陳述。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為其他資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我將會報告此情況。目前，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會負責財務報表的責任。\n\n金融管理專員負責編製財務報表，以真實公允的方式呈列，符合香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，並建立必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表免受重大錯誤陳述，無論是由於欺詐或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，金融管理專員負責評估集團持續經營的能力，適當時披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會負責監管本集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理確信，以確定財務報表整體上是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理確信是一種高水準的確信，但並不能保證根據審計署的審計準則進行的審計始終能發現存在的重要錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合併起來，合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n作為遵循審計署的審計準則進行審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，不論是由於欺詐或錯誤所致，設計及執行對該等風險有回應的審計程序，並獲取充分且適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的依據。因欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，未能察覺因欺詐導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤導致的風險；\n- 為了設計適合情況的審計程序，我需要了解與審計相關的內部控制，但此目的並非用以對該集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估所使用的會計政策的適當性，以及金融管理專員所做的會計估計及相關揭露的合理性；\n- 對金融管理專員使用持續經營作為會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對該集團持續經營能力構成重大不確定性的事件或情況。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我需要在我的審計報告中引起注意至財務報表中的相關揭露，若該等揭露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至我審計報告日期的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致該集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體列報、結構及內容，包括揭露，以及財務報表是否以公允列報的方式反映相關交易及事項；以及\n- 取得關於該集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的足夠且適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我對集團審計的指導、監督及執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負全部責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會就審計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中識別出的任何內部控制缺陷進行溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們通報所有可能與我的獨立性存在關聯的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，提供相關保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會溝通的事項，我確定在本期財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，即關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中說明這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在罕見情況下，我認為不予披露該事項將避免可能產生的不利後果，而此類後果將高於公眾利益。\n\n約翰·朱 審計署署長\n"}
