{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment.

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管面臨複雜的外部環境，香港經濟在2023年仍呈現正向增長，主要得益於訪客數量回升以及本地消費需求的支撐。勞動市場持續改善，與經濟同歩發展，而通脹則維持溫和水平。然而，由於金融環境收緊及市場信心不足，資產市場表現平平。預計2024年的經濟活動將持續以穩健步伐回升，但前景仍受多項外部不確定因素影響。\n\n# 經濟概況\n\n# 實際活動\n\n經歷了前一年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟於2023年穩健增長3.2%（見表1及圖1）。本地方面，勞工市場改善，加上政府推出的消費券計劃及一系列推廣活動等支持措施，帶動了私營消費的顯著回升。儘管金融環境收緊，但整體投資支出仍錄得顯著增長，主要受益於去年同期較低的基數。外部方面，香港的服務出口受益於入境旅遊業的強勁復甦而有所回升。然而，出境旅遊的快速反彈，計入服務進口，部分抵消了這項正面影響。另一方面，商品出口表現疲弱，受到外部需求不足的影響，拖累了香港的本地生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖表 1 實質 GDP 增長分項貢獻\n資料來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出項目計算的實際國內生產總值增長（環比）\n註：經季節調整後的國內固定資本形成額季度環比變動率數據不可用。\n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n2023年本地通脹保持溫和，因外部價格壓力逐漸緩解，儘管經濟復甦使國內成本壓力略有上升，但整體仍大致受控（圖表2）¹。2023年全年，核心及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2023年勞動市場持續改善，失業率於七月份降至十年來最低的2.8%，其後餘下月份維持於低位（圖3）。總就業人數增加（圖3），反映勞工供應亦有所擴充。鑑於香港勞動力短缺，政府於2023年推出多項勞工輸入計劃及人才吸引措施。同時，由於勞動市場供求緊張，名義工資及勞工收入的按年增長率逐漸回升至疫情前水平。\n\n圖表2 核心消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況\n來源：統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n在2023年初市場 стабилизировавшись 後，本地股市在第二季表現疲軟。恒生指數延續2022年底的反彈，於2023年1月27日收市報22,689點，創下年內高點。其後指數回落，並在12月進一步下跌至低位（圖4），反映市場情緒受美國及瑞士銀行業問題於3月所影響，以及下半年全球經濟前景不明朗及金融環境收緊所致。恒生指數全年收市報17,047點，較2022年底下跌13.8%，連續第四年呈現下跌趨勢。\n\n# 房地產業\n\n住宅物業市場在二零二三年首四個月，受益於內地及香港經濟活動逐漸恢復正常，曾出現反彈，但其後隨着按揭利率上升及市場氣氛轉淡而有所調整。 總體而言，二零二三年住宅物業價格按年下跌6.9%，而成交宗數進一步減少4.5%，創下歷史新低，僅錄得43,002宗。 儘管物業價格略為下調，但房屋的負載能力仍然較為吃緊。 類似地，非住宅物業市場持續面對挑戰，寫字樓、零售舖位及士多工業大廈的價格亦進一步回落。 寫字樓租金持續承壓，原因是空置率高企，加上遠程辦公模式普及及供應量增加。 另一方面，零售舖位租金在二零二三年則錄得上升， وذلك 受惠於入境旅遊業的復甦及私人消費的改善。\n\n圖表4 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟生態\n\n2024年，香港經濟預期將持續以穩健步伐復甦。受益於處理能力的持續提升以及政府積極推廣大型活動，入境旅遊業有望進一步擴大。本地消費活動則將受益於就業市場的穩定。政府將推行的各項基礎設施項目亦將為經濟提供有力支持。同時，隨著全球科技產業週期預期回升，香港的商品出口亦有機會穩定。政府預測2024年實際本地生產總值將穩步增長2.5%至3.5%。然而，前景仍面臨多重風險及不確定性，包括美國利率政策的走向、科技產業週期復甦的進度、全球經濟增長的可望性，以及地緣政治局勢的演變等。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2024年本地通脹將維持溫和，由於外部價格壓力減緩，有助於抵銷經濟持續復甦及租金上漲對國內成本造成的影響。市場普遍預測2024年整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預計整體通脹率及核心通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，勞動市場將受益於持續的經濟復甦，同時各項勞動力引進及吸引優秀人才的措施將持續有助於緩解各行業的人手短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業績\n\n二零二三年，香港銀行業面臨多重挑戰，包括高利率環境、美國及歐洲三月銀行事件引發的全球金融市場波動，以及內地及香港經濟復甦進度未達預期。 儘管如此，香港銀行業依然保持穩健，並受益於充足的資本及流動性儲備。 儘管不良貸款比率有所上升，銀行業的資產質量仍然保持健康。 銀行盈利能力顯著改善，主要得益於淨利息收入的增長。\n\n# 資產風險評估\n\n銀行業不良貸款比率截至2023年末上升至1.56%，較2022年末的1.40%有所增長。同期，逾期及重組貸款比率亦從0.85%上升至1.24%（見圖表5）。與內地相關貸款的不良貸款比率亦由去年同期的2.26%增至2023年末的2.58%。此增長主要源於對內地房地產開發商的貸款風險評級調降。儘管如此，各銀行已計提的撥備金仍屬充足。截至2023年末，撥備金覆蓋率（即總撥備金與不良貸款比率之比）為75%。若將不良貸款所擔保的抵押品市值納入考量，調整後的撥備金覆蓋率將約為145%。同時，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的不良貸款比率則維持在低位，分別為0.08%及0.30%（見圖表6）。\n\n圖表5 銀行業資產質素\n備註：數據涵蓋香港分行、海外分行及主要海外子公司。\n來源：金管局\n\n圖表6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率 資料來源：香港金管局\n\n# 盈利發展趨勢\n\n2023年銀行業錄得顯著的盈利增長。零售銀行稅前經營利潤總額較去年增長62.1%，同期稅後資產回報率從0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。盈利改善主要得益於淨利息收入增加30%，以及2023年交易性投資的顯著收益，與前一年輕微虧損形成對比。然而，貸款減損費用增加28%在一定程度上抵消了上述增長，此為針對新分類貸款所提列的特定準備金。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息差擴大至1.68%（較前一年1.31%）（圖8）。同時，零售銀行的成本收入比從2022年的48.0%降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行業績\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表 9 零售銀行的成本收入比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 財務報表趨勢分析\n\n銀行業資產負債表於二零二三年增長0.9%。此增長主要得益於持有的有價證券（增長8.6%）及銀行間融資（增長4.4%），但總貸款則有所下降，部分抵消了上述增長。 由於借貸成本上升，加上全球經濟前景不明朗，貸款需求受到抑制，總貸款在二零二三年減少了3.6%。香港本地貸款基本持平（減少0.4%），而以外地及貿易融資貸款則分別減少了10.4%和13.1%。面向內地的貸款在二零二三年減少了6.6%。\n\n在負債方，2023年總存款較去年同期上升5.1%，而2022年則為1.7%。由於總貸款下降，貸款與存款比率從去年同期的68.5%降至2023年底的62.8%（圖表10）。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業在2023年仍保持充足的資本。截至2023年底，本地註冊的授權機構（AIs）合併總資本比率為21.1%，較去年同期上升至20.1%。一級資本比率為18.9%（圖表11）。兩項比率均遠高於各自的國際最低要求。截至2023年底，巴塞爾III杠杆比率為7.9%（圖表12）。\n\n圖表10 銀行業貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n圖表11 本地註冊的持牌金融機構合併資本比率\n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表 12 本地註冊授權機構綜合槓桿比率 資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 流動性情況\n\n銀行業持續維持強勁的流動性狀況。2023年第四季，一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋率（LCR）為178.6%，二類機構的季度平均流動性維持率（LMR）為65.7%（圖表13）。銀行業的主要資金來源為客戶存款。截至2023年底，一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為144.4%，二類A機構的核心資金比率（CFR）為169.4%（圖表14）。四項比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖表 13 指定持牌機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖14 指定銀行的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2023年，在市場預期美國政策利率將持續高位的背景下，港元主要在可兌換範圍的弱方波動，自2月中旬至5月初期間，兌換保證機制被觸發八次。自5月起，港元有所回升，年末的匯率約在7.8的中心匯率附近。在聯繫匯率制度下，該制度於2023年慶祝四十年週年，香港銀行同業拆息利率大致追蹤其美元對應利率，同時也受到本地供求影響。總體而言，港元匯市和貨幣市場保持穩定，交易暢順有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一次又一次地展現出其應對外部衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定性定義為港元對美元的匯率在匯率制度框架內，維持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵是貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備資產支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動必須與外匯基金中美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務憑證，用以完全擔保由三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣；\n- 政府發行的流通中的貨幣紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結餘額，即存於香港金融管理局結算帳戶的結餘總和；及\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發行基金票據及票息憑證。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性，透過自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行貨幣可兌換承諾（CUs）來維持。當強方（或弱方）CUs被觸發時，香港金融管理局隨時準備以每美元7.75港元（或7.85港元）的匯率，按銀行要求向其出售（或購買）港元，換取美元。此舉將使累積結餘擴張（或收縮），從而壓低（或提高）港元利率，協助港元匯率重新回到7.75至7.85的貨幣可兌換區間內。\n\n# 2023年總結\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在市場預期美國利率將維持高位的背景下，2023年港元持續偏弱，並主要在兌換區間的弱方波動。從二月中旬至五月初，弱方機制被觸發八次。五月初至七月初，港元匯率因上市公司的股息支付及企業中期資金需求回升，其後，港元匯率主要受到本地資金供需變化影響，例如透過南向互聯互通機制（南向通）的資金流入，年末的匯率在7.8的中間價附近成交（見圖1）。總體而言，2023年港元匯率市場持續正常運作。\n\n圖表1 市場匯率\n\n二月至五月期間，香港金融管理局應銀行要求，按照聯繫匯率制度的設計，總共購入了515億港元的外匯，以維持弱方兌換。反映弱方兌換的啟動，結餘總額由2022年底的963億港元減少至2023年底的450億港元。同期，未償還的外匯基金票據略有增加，由1,200.4億港元增至1,245.5億港元。因此，結餘總額與未償還外匯基金票據總額由2022年底的1,296.7億港元下降至2023年底的1,290.4億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖表 2：2023年綜合結餘（未扣除再貼現窗口）及未償還之交換基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據LERS（London Interbank Offered Rate System），香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）通常跟隨其美元對應利率。2023年前七個月，由於美國持續加息，HIBOR普遍上漲（圖表3）。截至年末，隔夜、1個月及3個月HIBOR分別上調286、92及16基點，至6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n香港聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，基準利率已連續上調四次，總計上調一百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%上調至5.75%。在零售方面，跟隨美國政策利率調整，多家銀行於五月初及七月底分別上調最優惠貸款利率12.5個基點。部分銀行同時調整了以HIBOR（香港銀行同業拆借利率）為基準的新批按揭貸款的利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。總體而言，香港貨幣市場持續穩定運作。2023年再貼現窗口借款額增至388億港元，較2022年的84億港元顯著增加，相關用途並未出現異常情況。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度在過去四十年間一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並在面對各種挑戰時展現出其穩健和韌性。儘管美國利率走勢及全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定性，香港港元匯率及貨幣市場仍有序運作，充分反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。政府堅定支持聯繫匯率制度。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在其2023年《外匯部門報告》中再次強調，聯繫匯率制度的可信度得益於一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管及監察、靈活的經濟體制以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續順利運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率在國際標準下表現非常良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對銀行貸款的監管工作。\n\n為提高匯換基金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從匯換基金資產中劃出特定部分，用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）於2022年底為110.12%，至2023年5月4日一度升至112.71%，超過了上限觸發水平112.5%（圖4）。此情況主要反映當年首半年因觸發弱方貨幣單位（CU）而導致總結餘縮減。根據匯換基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，並因贖回債務證書，資產已從支持投資組合轉移至投資組合，使支持比率於5月8日降至約109.97%。其後，支持比率穩步上升，至2023年12月31日收市為110.73%。根據流動性匯率制度（LERS），雖然特定匯換基金資產已指定用作支持投資組合，但所有匯換基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。匯換基金充足的財政資源，加上穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖表4 2023年風險覆蓋比率每日變化\n\n# 貨幣委員會轄下委員會\n\n外匯基金聯繫匯率局小組委員會（CBC）負責監察及審核與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。 2023年，CBC 審閱了包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩盤、美國聯邦儲備局為香港銀行提供的美元流動性支持措施的影響，以及近期香港美元利率的變動等問題。 CBC就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的聯繫匯率制度運作報告，均已上載至香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 紙幣和硬幣\n\n以下表格總結了2023年底流通中的紙幣和硬幣的價值。\n\n圖表5 2023年底各發鈔銀行流通紙幣\n\n圖表6：2023年底流通鈔票的分布\n\n圖表7 截至2023年底流通紙幣\n\n圖表 8 截至 2023 年底，流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣\n\n圖表9 2023年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通情況分類統計\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n年內，香港金融管理局繼續為銀行出納、零售商戶收銀員及學生舉辦研討會，以提升他們辨別香港鈔票的知識及技能。2023年，共安排了15場研討會，約有3,000名參與者。\n\n# 硬幣收藏方案\n\n硬幣收藏計劃持續受到公眾好評。更多資訊請參閱《2023年可持續發展報告》中香港金融管理局的可持續發展章節。\n\n# 交換基金短期票據\n\nEFBN計劃運作順利。截至2023年底，未償還的外匯基金票據名義金額約為1,255.4億港元（表2）。\n\n表二：EFBNs 尚待解決的問題\n\n# 金融研究\n\n香港金融與貨幣研究中心（HKIMR），作為香港財經學院的研究機構，已發表二十篇工作論文，並舉辦十七場研討會及網絡研討會，主題涵蓋對香港及區域具有關鍵性的貨幣與金融研究。HKIMR 亦在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）上發佈了六份電子刊物，向SSRN的全球研究社群傳播研究成果。此外，為向公眾提供近期發表的工作論文之高層次、非技術性洞見，HKIMR 發行了《貨幣研究洞見》兩期刊物。\n\n除了其研究活動外，香港國際金融中心（HKIMR）舉辦了四項國際活動，包括一場圓桌會議及四場與學術界、全球央行及國際金融機構的線上研討會，以促進經濟及金融議題的交流。\n\n# 3月9日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）駐中國高級代表史蒂文·艾倫·巴內特博士與國際貨幣基金組織中國香港特別行政區代表帕卡瓦·賈薩庫爾博士主講的「中國經濟復甦：最新發展與展望」研討會舉行。巴內特博士分享了他對中國經濟最新發展的觀點，以及短期和中期需要關注的問題。研討會吸引了超過一百名與會者。\n\n# 4月17日\n\n應對複雜的世界研討會舉行。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）的四位專家分享了他們對IMF最新版《世界經濟展望》和《全球金融穩定報告》分析內容的觀點。超過五十位與會者參加了此次研討會。\n\n# 4月25\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）於2023年4月發布《全球金融穩定報告》，舉辦一場研討會，由IMF貨幣與資本市場部助理主任吳博士及資深金融部門專家柏英科先生主講，主題為「在高通膨與利率環境下維護全球金融穩定」。超過八十位與會者參加了本次研討會。\n\n# 五月二日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織亞洲及太平洋部主任克里希納·斯里尼瓦桑（Krishna Srinivasan）與香港金融管理局總裁葉志強（Eddie Yue）共同主持了一場座談會。斯里尼瓦桑主任概述了國際貨幣基金組織近期發布的《亞洲區域經濟展望》報告的主要內容，並分享了他對全球及區域經濟發展趨勢與潛在風險的看法。此外，座談會還討論了與區域經濟及國際貨幣體系演變相關的多項重要議題。約有120位與會者參加了是次活動。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年儘管面臨多重挑戰，包括美國及歐洲三月的銀行風波、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢，但仍保持強勁和穩健。金管局對三月銀行風波迅速作出應對，從管理相關影響到完成內部審查，涵蓋監管流程和解決機制等範疇，並從中總結經驗教訓，持續專注於持牌金融機構的信貸、流動資金和市場風險管理。為應對日益嚴峻的網絡安全威脅，並配合第三方科技服務的廣泛應用，金管局亦與持牌金融機構緊密合作，提升其營運及網絡安全保障能力。\n\n香港金融管理局加強了對支付卡的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂《銀行業行為守則》以及推出《反詐騙消費者保護憲章》。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，為與虛擬資產相關的活動制定平衡的監管框架，簡化了面向專業投資者的銷售流程，並對「跨境財富管理通證試點計劃」進行了改進，同時開始監管信託業務。為配合「信貸數據智能系統」下的消費者信貸參考服務提供，已啟動一項試點計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，體現了其在風險為本策略下，針對最高風險的承諾。為應對日益增加的數字詐騙，金管局已加強生態系統合作，透過推出即時詐騙監測系統，並擴展公私機構資訊共享合作夥伴關係的範圍，包括成立詐騙及洗錢情報行動小組。推出創新平台以促進銀行間資訊共享，將有助於應對人頭賬戶網絡的風險。同時，金管局亦與業界密切合作，採取協調行動處理日益增加的詐騙相關銀行投訴，並提高公眾對各種詐騙手法的警覺，包括在使用快速支付系統進行交易前的警示機制。此外，亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃，進一步提升監管科技能力。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準取得顯著進展，包括資本充足率及資訊披露等要求。同時，銀行業能力建設亦見成效，成功吸引並培養未來人才，並提升現有專業人員的技能。此外，香港存款保障局已完成對存款保障計劃建議改進方案的公眾諮詢。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推進其工作，以確保具備可信的解決機制。已制定與獲取關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決標準，並完成對實施吸收損失能力政策標準的檢討。在與銀行就解決機制規劃方面取得重大進展，有效應對解決過程中的提前終止風險及營運持續性問題。香港金融管理局亦持續積極參與國際政策倡議及區域合作，推動解決機制發展。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的主要目標是促進銀行體系的穩定發展。 穩健的金融體系是實現此目標的關鍵，它能夠滿足香港經濟的金融需求。\n\n金融管理局透過銀行營運及處理業務的方式，以及在極端情況下可能出現的無序倒閉，會影響金融體系的穩定性。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，確保銀行具備應對突發事件的韌性，並能在危機發生時迅速恢復運作，從而有助於預防銀行倒閉。 金融管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責授權香港的持牌銀行、限制性持牌銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（Authorized Institutions，簡稱AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為認可金融機構（AIs）的解決機制權威，致力於確保在認可金融機構（AIs）出現無法持續經營的情況下，其失敗能夠有序處理。為達此目的，香港已建立金融機構的解決機制制度，根據該制度，金管局是認可金融機構及其他類別機構的解決機制權威。為有效實施香港的解決機制，制定解決機制規則和政策標準、進行解決機制規劃以消除影響認可金融機構可解決性的障礙，以及發展金管局解決失敗認可金融機構的能力至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採取與國際接軌且協調一致的方法。\n\n金管局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施。在監管這些基礎設施時，金管局旨在維護其安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並確保透明度。 提升金融市場基礎設施的穩健性，有助於保障香港的貨幣及金融體系，免受因其運作出現問題而可能引發的影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n年內，金管局向兩間在香港以外註冊成立的銀行，發出了一項銀行牌照及一張受限制銀行牌照。此外，金管局亦批准四間外國交易平台營運商從事貨幣經紀業務，並撤銷了先前授予一間貨幣經紀商的牌照。年內，金管局亦撤銷了五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關人工智能及香港本地代表辦事處的更多資料，請參閱附錄，以及第313至316頁及第322至325頁的表D至F。\n\n# 三層銀行體系考察\n\n二零二三年，香港金融管理局對香港銀行體系的三級制度進行全面檢討，旨在簡化其結構。檢討結果顯示，現行的三級制度已比為平衡銀行體系靈活性及保障小額存款人所需複雜。為此，香港金融管理局於六月展開為期三個月的諮詢，建議將三級銀行體系簡化為兩級，將吸收存款公司納入受限制牌照銀行範疇，從而構建香港銀行體系的新第二級。諮詢普遍反映對此建議的支持。\n\n# 監管活動總覽\n\n香港金融管理局於二零二三年進行了177項非現場審查，涵蓋多個範疇，包括CAMEL評級評估（CAMEL評級系統）、公司治理及風險管理。為持續加強風險監管，香港金融管理局共舉行了38場與持牌機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會的會議。此外，香港金融管理局、持牌機構及其外部審計師之間亦舉行了38場三方會議。\n\n香港金融管理局除以外地活動外，定期對持牌銀行進行實地審查，覆蓋範圍廣泛。鑒於目前高利率環境及部分內地房地產發展商的債務違約，信貸風險管理成為重點監管範疇。同時，隨著持牌銀行對科技的應用進一步加速，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦是另一項主要關注點。香港金融管理局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出一輪以氣候相關風險治理為主題的專項審查，以及一系列諮詢會議，向持牌銀行提供監管指引。\n\n自二零二三年三月起，美國及歐洲銀行體系所面臨的危機，在規模與影響範圍上，乃是自二零零八年全球金融危機以來最嚴峻的系統性挑戰。香港金融管理局（HKMA）於危機期間保持高度警覺，並採取一系列預防措施，以確保潛在的影響不會動搖本地銀行及金融體系的穩定性。危機過後，香港金融管理局進行內部檢討，參考所獲觀察及經驗。為強化監管成效，並提升應對未來銀行危機的能力，香港金融管理局已制定詳細的行動計劃，將相關經驗納入考量。更多關於香港金融管理局在此方面的工作細節，請參閱第95頁的「流動性及市場風險」部分。\n\n在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務，以及消費者保護事宜進行實地檢查，並就評估風險較高或具新意的範疇進行主題審查。\n\n表1載列香港金融管理局2023年的監管活動。\n\n表一 監督活動情況彙總\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款較2022年下降3.6%，當時為下降3.0%。表2顯示貸款及融資的細項。與內地相關的貸款在2023年減少6.6%，至4,226億港元（見表3）。\n\n表2 貸款及融資增長\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局在高利率環境及內地樓市持續疲軟下，加強監察授權機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理措施。當年銀行業的資產質素有所惡化，但仍屬可控。截至2023年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。與內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率則由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局進行了重點巡查，評估金融機構在信貸風險管理方面的表現，重點關注對高風險行業的風險敞口、溢價融資、對香港以外業務的信貸風險監管，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶的現金流壓力\n\n香港金融管理局與銀行界中小企業信貸協調機制於七月宣布，將有序退出預先核批本金還款寬限計劃。該計劃於二零二零年五月推出，旨在協助合資格企業渡過疫情。顧及業界意見後，部分本金還款選項已進行優化，以協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。即使疫情結束後，個別行業或借款人仍面臨挑戰，銀行將繼續根據個別情況，提供本金寬限期或其他適當的信貸緩解措施。\n\n金管局同時鼓勵銀行在處理未參與計劃但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業的融資需求時，多加體諒。同時提醒銀行，在處理企業出現還款困難時，應遵循「香港處理企業困難指引」，確保各銀行能通力合作，顧及所有貸款人的共同利益。\n\n# 房地產按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局陸續推出的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，有助於加強銀行對房地產按揭貸款業務的風險管理，並提升銀行體系應對房價調整所帶來的挑戰的能力。2023年批准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款價值比率為57%，較首次推出逆周期措施前的2009年9月的64%為低（圖1）。2023年新按揭貸款的平均債務收入比率維持在40%的低水平，與首次實施債務收入比率上限的2010年8月的41%相若。\n\n香港金融管理局於七月七日，經考慮樓宇價格、成交量及本地及外部經濟環境等因素後，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自二零零九年起推行相關措施以來的首次放寬。調整內容包括提高住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款成數（LTV），以及根據按揭申請人資產淨值評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款成數。此外，取消了對主要收入來源為香港以外地區的按揭申請人，降低適用最高LTV及債務收入比率（DSR）上限十個百分點的要求。同時，亦取消了當按揭申請人的總按揭融資超出香港金融管理局正常可接受的LTV上限二十個百分點時，需對適用DSR上限減五個百分點的要求。\n\n圖表 1 新住宅按揭貸款批准的平均貸款價值比例及債務服務比率\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 香港外匯基金\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 財政司司長\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人證明已審計聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「集團」）載於第211至311頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括截至2023年12月31日聯匯基金及集團的資產負債表，以及該會計年度的收支表、綜合損益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策資訊。\n\n根據我的意見，截至二零二三年十二月三十一日，該基金及本集團的財務報表真實公平地反映了該基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量。此財務報表已根據香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，並已根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條發出的指示適當編製。\n\n# 意見理由\n\n我遵照行政長官根據《交易所基金條例》第7條發出的指示，並按照審計署的審計準則進行審計。有關我的職責，已在報告的「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節中詳細說明。我符合該等準則的要求，與本集團保持獨立，並已履行其他專業道德責任。我認為已取得的審計證據充足且適當，足以作為發表意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指於截至2023年12月31日止年度，我根據專業判斷認為最重要的審計事項。這些事項是在我審計整體財務報表時所考量，並作為形成審計意見的依據。我對這些事項不提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資訊。該等資訊包括香港金融管理局二零二三年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我對該等財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我的意見僅限於財務報表，並不涉及其他資訊，且我對此類資訊不作出任何審核結論。\n\n就我審計財務報表而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估這些資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中取得的資訊存在重大失報，或以其他方式存在重大錯報。若我根據審計結果判斷其他資訊存在重大失報或錯報，我將會報告此情況。目前，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 香港金融管理局及匯基金諮詢委員會審計委員會對財務報表的職責\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表應按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《發行基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，作出真實而公平的呈述，並負責建立金管局認為為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤陳述而必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣審查局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n匯儲基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師的財務報表審計責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理確信，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在因舞弊或錯誤所致的重大錯誤陳述，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理確信是一種高水準的確信，但並非保證依照審計委員會審計準則所進行的審計，始終能夠在存在重大錯誤陳述時予以察覺。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合併起來可能合理地影響基於這些財務報表所做出的使用者經濟決策，則視為重大錯誤陳述。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計時，我會行使專業判斷，並在審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我：\n\n識別並評估財務報表中重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的依據。未能發現因詐欺所致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤所致的風險，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制之上；\n為設計適當的審計程序，我需了解與審計相關的內部控制，但此目的並非用以表達對集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n評估貨幣機關所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及會計估計和相關披露是否合理；\n就貨幣機關使用持續經營基礎的會計適當性做出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，或在披露不充分的情況下修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據得出的。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以公允表達方式反映其背後的交易和事件；\n取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以就集團內各個實體或業務活動的財務資訊表達對財務報表的意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督和執行。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我會向金融管理局諮詢委員會的審計小組匯報，內容包括審計的規劃範圍和時間，以及我審計過程中發現的重大審計結果，其中亦包括任何重要的內部監控不足。\n\n我亦會向聯絡匯豐銀行顧問委員會的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們披露所有可能涉及我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與聯邦匯業管理委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項，我確定在本期財務報表審計中，最具重要性的事項，即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露相關事項，或在極少數情況下，我認為披露該事項可能產生的不利影響，合理預期會超過公眾利益，否則我將在審計師報告中說明這些事項。\n\n林志源尼爾遜教授\n審計主任\n\n# 核心活動\n\n金管局根據財政司司長授權，以匯儲基金監管員身份管理匯儲基金（該基金），並依據《匯儲基金條例》（第66章）的規定履行職責。該基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的匯率穩定，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定。\n\n基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：後備投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及策略投資組合。根據香港聯繫匯率制度，後備投資組合的資產完全對應香港的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港特別行政區政府為基金戰略目的而收購的香港交易所及清算所有限公司股份。經營分部資訊詳見附註31。\n\n# 二、存貨會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，而香港財務報告準則乃一項統稱，涵蓋香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋，以及香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱「本集團」）採納的重大會計政策如下所述。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的或修訂的香港財務報告準則（HKFRS），這些準則在本集團的本期會計期間首次生效或可供提前採用。附註3說明了這些準則首次應用對本集團本期及過往會計期間所產生的會計政策變更（如有），以及這些變更對本集團的適用性。\n\n# 財務報表編製之依據\n\n集團財務報表包括本集團的財務報表，以及集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務已於附註16及17中披露。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按公允價值衡量：\n- 衍生金融工具（參見附註 2.6）；\n- 按公允價值透過損益帳戶計量的金融資產及金融負債（參見附註 2.6）；\n- 按公允價值透過其他綜合收益計量的金融資產（參見附註 2.6）；\n- 黃金（參見附註 2.10）；以及\n- 投資性不動產（參見附註 2.11）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需作出判斷、估計，並應用相關假設，以影響會計政策的應用及資產、負債、收入及開支的報告金額。 這些估計及假設乃基於過往經驗，並考量所有相關因素。 其結果為評估資產及負債賬面價值提供了依據，而這些賬面價值難以直接從其他途徑得知。 實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行審查。會計估計的修訂，若僅影響當期，則於當期認列；若同時影響當期及未來期間，則於修訂期及後續期間認列。\n\n管理層根據香港財務報告準則所作的判斷，若對財務報表有重大影響及主要的估計變動性來源，已披露於附註2.18。\n\n若干比較數字已重新調整，以使與本集團財務報表本年度的呈現方式保持一致。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團若能從參與該實體中獲得變動回報，並且有能力透過其控制權影響這些回報，則視為集團對該實體具有控制權。評估集團是否具有控制權時，僅考慮集團及其他方所持有的實質權益。\n"}
