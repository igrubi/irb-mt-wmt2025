{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","zh":"# 行政長官聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現遠超預期：實體經濟維持穩健增長，通脹溫和；儘管美國聯邦儲備系統當年三次調升利率並縮減資產負債表，但未導致新興市場經濟體出現資本外流或美元走強。在樂觀氛圍下，全球股市，包括美國三大股指，持續創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲34%。恒生指數在2017年上漲近8,000點（或36%），並於2018年1月突破30,000點，創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在當時的環境中，充滿樂觀，甚至洋溢著熱情。然而，這種情況直到今年二月初才改變，當時最新的數據顯示美國工資增幅超出預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市出現一波調整。二月初的第二週，道瓊斯指數兩天內下跌超過一千點，恆生指數在同一週亦下跌超過三千點。美國十年期國債收益率一度攀升至2.95%。資金流動的快速反轉顯示，創紀錄的市場估值根基不穩。這也提醒我們，香港需要一個健全且穩健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動及資本外流帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 預防措施提升銀行體系韌性\n\n香港金融管理局於2017年進一步實施風險減輕措施，以維護香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。為防患未然，我們在五月份推出了第八輪針對銀行按揭貸款的逆周期措施，並加強銀行對物業發展商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系應對樓市下行風險的能力。經過幾輪措施的實施，截至2017年底，新按揭住宅貸款的平均貸款與物業估值比率降至49%，較2009年9月的64%有所下降；同時，平均還款比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了專責處置辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被視為「太大而無法倒閉」的金融機構。此舉旨在避免重蹈二零零八年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時政府動用公帑拯救面臨困境的金融機構，並減輕其關閉對金融體系、經濟及社會各界造成的影響。\n\n健全的風險管理是銀行業穩健可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率均遠高於適用的法定要求，並在全球名列前茅。這無疑體現了香港銀行體系的高度韌性。事實上，2017年銀行業錄得強勁增長，總貸款額增長16%，同時資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。2017年銀行業整體資本回報率（以稅前營運利潤計算）達11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心，表現出非常健康的水平。\n\n# 健全的銀行體系是長期金融穩定的關鍵。\n\n香港金融管理局近年來加強推動「健全銀行業」的發展，以應對二零零八年全球金融危機所暴露的局限性：過度追求利潤而忽略首要責任。為確保銀行在追求盈利的同時，兼顧客戶及自身長遠利益，我們鼓勵銀行建立與其企業文化和價值觀相符的績效考核制度。為此，香港金融管理局於二零一七年三月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事年會，旨在強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並協助獨立非執行董事更有效地履行監察及監督職責。\n\n在銀行業界的支持下，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2017年在推動金融包容方面取得了顯著進展。六間實體銀行分行及三間流動銀行分行已在偏遠地區開始運作。香港銀行公會與八達通及多家便利店連鎖店合作，推出試點計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的便利店提取現金，無需購物。香港郵政今年亦在主要位於離島及新界地區的七間郵政局，提供長者現金提取服務。為方便開戶，香港金融管理局去年設立了專門的網頁及電子郵件地址，並安排團隊跟進公眾的相關查詢或投訴。 由於各方共同努力，個人及企業銀行戶口開戶的客戶體驗已顯著提升。\n\n# 金融科技：銀行業的創新驅動力\n\n在科技日新月異的時代，金融科技已逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在這個快速變化的科技環境中，銀行必須積極採納新發展，並在金融科技應用方面追求創新。為迎接智慧銀行新時代，香港金融管理局於九月推出了七項倡議（詳情請參閱第106頁），旨在推廣金融科技在銀行業的應用，以提升客戶的銀行產品及服務。儘管這些倡議彼此獨立，但它們是互補的，將為香港的支付及銀行服務帶來顯著的轉變。客戶不僅能享受更便捷、高效及安全的支付及銀行服務，還將擁有更多選擇，並對自身的財務交易擁有更大的控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁向智慧銀行新時代將為銀行提供絕佳的升級轉型機會。\n\n# 一帶一路與粵港澳大灣區倡議帶來的巨大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，多元化的金融產業對香港至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局加強了提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。鑒於香港獨有的立足內地、面向國際的優勢，「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區的發展，將為金融及銀行業帶來巨大的商機，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。為響應「一帶一路」倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自成立以來合作夥伴數量已增至約九十間，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資的融資樞紐奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，中國開發銀行在香港發行首期「一帶一路」債券，凸顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面所能發揮的關鍵作用。\n\n除了基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極推動香港發展成為企業財務中心、私募基金及亞洲衍生產品業務的樞紐，吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在本港管理其資金、資產及各種金融風險。 這些舉措將進一步鞏固並提升香港的金融及相關專業服務行業。香港金融管理局亦與負責大灣區發展的相關部門保持密切溝通，加強合作，以促進大灣區作為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直以「發揮香港優勢，支持國家發展」為主題持續發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年七月推出債券通北向交易後，內地與世界其他地區透過香港金融平台之間的互聯互通，已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯了香港作為金融中介，在促進全球投資者接觸內地金融市場方面所扮演的獨特角色。2017年，香港繼續保持全球最大的離岸人民幣業務樞紐地位。人民幣即時總結算系統的日均交易額達人民幣9000億元。此外，根據SWIFT的數據，當年全球逾70%的人民幣支付交易均通過香港進行。離岸人民幣市場持續順利運作，穩定發展。\n\n# 培養人才以強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n香港金融管理局持續致力於金融業的可持續發展，而人才培育至關重要。為強化銀行業的軟實力，我們一向鼓勵並支持銀行從業員的持續專業發展。在先前推出反洗錢、打擊恐怖融資及網絡安全三個模組的加強能力發展框架後，我們去年進一步擴展了其涵蓋範圍，納入零售財富管理及財務管理，藉此提升銀行從業員的核心能力。香港金融管理局亦積極培育銀行業的年輕人才。2017年，我們與業界合作推出私人財富管理學徒計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃，由於反應熱烈，未來將進一步擴展這些計劃的覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 穩健的投資策略，旨在於中長期內獲得合理且穩定的回報。\n\n儲備基金受益於全球經濟的強勁增長，去年投資收益創下歷史新高，達2640億港元，股票、債券及外匯等各類資產均錄得盈利。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率為12.1%，支持組合則為1.8%。自2009年成立以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部回報率高達13.7%。\n雖然去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求香港金融管理局持續謹慎管理儲備基金。我們將保持敏捷靈活，密切監察市場動態，並在適時採取防禦措施。長期增長組合的投資亦將進一步擴大。一貫以來，我們在管理香港市民的財富時，將以保值為先，追求長遠增長，並在可接受的風險範圍內進行投資。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續了去年的增長勢頭，但二零一八年仍存在不少不確定因素與潛在風險。其中，若通脹加速，美國可能加快加息的步伐；貿易摩擦持續升溫；以及地緣政治局勢亦可能惡化。若此等風險應驗，將對全球金融市場造成重大影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟帶來連帶影響。因此，我們都應審慎評估並管理相關風險。\n\n未來數月，港元利率的走勢很可能仍將成為市場關注的焦點。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備局已連續六次加息。隨著港元利率與美元利率之間的利差擴大，資金從港元轉向美元的動機亦隨之增強。近期，港元面臨貶值壓力，並已觸發7.85弱方聯繫匯率承諾（CU）。正如我們一再強調，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，香港金融管理局（金管局）將在市場上買入港元並出售美元，扮演「超級兌換商」的角色，以確保港元匯率不會低於7.85水平。此類操作乃正常市場調節，符合聯繫匯率制度的設計，並無可過慮之處。事實上，金管局目前管理的投資基金總額超過4萬億港元，其中港元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，為資金流動提供充足的緩衝。多年來，金管局已建立多道防線，以維護銀行及金融體系的穩定。從積極的角度來看，資金外流將有助於港元利率逐步上升，促進香港利率環境的正常化，進而支持本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，金管局將持續保持警惕，並竭盡所能維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","zh":"# 經濟與財政環境\n\n在全球經濟更趨協調擴張的背景下，香港在2017年經濟增長加快，勞工市場供不應求，通脹壓力則較為溫和。預計2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。\n\n# 經濟綜述\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在全球經濟協調擴張的背景下，香港經濟在2017年增速顯著。實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長率達致3.8%，較2016年的2.1%大幅提升，亦高於過去十年約3%的平均增長水平（見圖1及表1）。內需持續回升，其中私人消費增長加速，整體投資支出亦有所改善。穩健的內需主要得益於就業及收入狀況良好、資產價格上揚，以及商界信心增強。外部方面，受益於全球貿易流的擴大，香港商品出口錄得更快增長；服務出口則因貿易及貨運活動暢旺，以及訪港旅客增加而有所改善。商品進口亦因出口需求而顯著增長，服務進口則隨著本地居民的旅遊需求而穩定上升。然而，淨貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長構成負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣環境\n\n在貨幣方面，港元兌美元匯率一般因港元與美元之間的負利率差而受到利率套利活動的影響，整體對美元有所回落。這反映了聯繫匯率制度按照其設計正常運作。雖然仍處於相對低水平，但由於首次公開發售相關的資金需求以及銀行年底的流動性需求，2017年底港元銀行間利率面臨更大的上行壓力。就信貸增長而言，經過兩年個位數增長後，2017年總銀行貸款增速顯著加快至16.1%，反映經濟狀況改善及金融市場情緒樂觀。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸發放標準並未出現放鬆跡象，整體貸款質量仍然良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n二零一七年全年通脹壓力持續受控（圖表2）。扣除政府一次性減輕措施的影響後，核心通脹率降至一·七厘，較二零一六年上升至二·三厘。特別是，物價指數中的房屋成份增幅放緩，反映二零一六年私人住宅新租賃租金上漲速度減慢的影響。更廣泛地說，在強勁的產出增長下，名義工資和收入增幅溫和，有助於抑制本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦保持平穩，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹情況一致，即使美元匯率走弱亦然。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年，隨著經濟成長表現亮眼，勞動市場出現趨緊現象。經季節調整後，失業率從2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，為近20年來首次低於3%（見圖3）。主要經濟部門的失業率普遍呈現下降趨勢，其中零售、金融及專業服務業的降幅尤為顯著。總體就業人數持續增加，私人部門的職位空缺亦有所擴大，進而推動了勞動需求的持續增強。同時，勞動人口規模亦有所擴張，部分原因在於年長勞工（55歲及以上）的參與度提高。在勞動市場條件趨緊且通貨膨脹率下降的背景下，實際工資與薪資的增長速度亦有所加快。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2017年經歷了一段近乎不間斷的上漲。恆生指數上漲了36%，創下自2010年以來的最大年度增幅（圖表4）。這段上漲反映了市場對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並在一定程度上得益於內地投資者透過滬港通及深港通的大量資金流入。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年末維持在高位。平均每日成交額從前一年的669億港元增長至883億港元，本地市場籌集的總資金亦增至5814億港元，較一年前的4901億港元有顯著增長。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持向上趨勢（圖表4）。交易量由去年同期的54,701個單位增至61,591個單位，2017年樓宇價格上漲了14.8%。房屋可負擔性持續下降，價格收入比率達16.4倍，較1997年的峰值更高，而收入負擔比率則為74.1倍，遠高於長期平均水平。鑑於樓價持續上升，加上銀行間按揭業務競爭激烈，金管局於五月推出第八輪審慎措施，旨在加強銀行風險管理，維護金融體系穩定。這些措施推出後，樓價增長一度放緩，但在第四季再次加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，全年交易活動顯著活躍，交易金額及成交宗數均錄得雙位數增長。隨着非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報率較去年略為下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟發展環境\n\n預計2018年的經濟增長將維持穩健。政府預測增長率介於3%至4%之間，而私營機構分析則預期經濟平均增長3.2%。外部方面，香港的出口表現將持續受益於全球經濟的復甦以及來港旅客的增加。 國內消費方面，由於勞動市場狀況良好，預期將保持穩定。就固定資本形成而言，房屋供應增加和基礎設施項目的持續進行將推動建築活動穩步發展。 儘管經濟狀況改善將支持企業資本支出，但利率上升可能構成挑戰。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n儘管全球通脹溫和，本地成本持續上升，預計香港2018年的通脹壓力將維持溫和，但通脹率或於2017年的低位回升。例如，由於私人住宅租金持續調整，租金成分的通脹或於下半年加速上升。市場普遍預測2018年的綜合通脹率仍將維持在2.2%的溫和水平，而政府預計核心通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築活動的擴張，以及來往旅客的逐步回升，預計將在短期內維持勞工市場的緊張。 私人機構分析員預測，2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%的水平。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景面臨多項不確定性及風險，包括主要央行貨幣政策調整、全球金融市場的穩定性，以及保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張。若此等風險應驗，可能導致資金自香港逆流，本地貨幣環境或將比預期更快收緊，對實際經濟及資產價格構成下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的展望仍然不明朗。短期內，受益於目前穩健的國內經濟狀況、普遍認可的房屋供應不足、低按揭利率，以及多元化的房屋融資途徑（包括發展商提供的按揭貸款及來自家長的財務支持），對物業的需求預計將持續。然而，近期全球金融市場的波動或將影響投資者信心。展望長期，物業市場仍將面臨多項挑戰。尤其值得注意的是，隨著美國貨幣政策逐步正常化，本地按揭利率亦將隨之上升。此外，在政府積極增加土地及住宅物業供應的推動下，房屋供需失衡的狀況預期將逐漸縮小，有助於減緩物業價格的上升壓力。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n香港銀行業在2017年持續保持財務穩健，儘管全球經濟充滿不確定性。獲授權機構（AIs）的資本及流動性狀況維持強勁，資產質素保持健康水平，盈利能力則因利差擴大及信貸增長而顯著提升。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續，2017年香港銀行同業拆息 (HIBOR) 的一個月及三個月期定盤價分別上升了49個基點及39個基點。第四季的升幅尤其顯著。然而，以綜合利率衡量的零售銀行港元資金成本，全年大致保持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行在香港辦事處的稅前經營利潤總額，於2017年增長了15.8%。此增長主要得益於淨利息收入（+20.3%）及手續費及佣金收入（+9.4%）的增加。然而，外匯及衍生工具業務收入的下降（-29.9%）以及營運費用增長（+8.4%）部分抵消了這些增長。由於2016年錄得的某些非經常性項目，零售銀行稅後總利潤下降了18.1%。零售銀行平均資產稅後回報率從2016年的1.44%降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差在2017年擴大至1.45%，較2016年的1.32%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上漲。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營業收入的比例從2016年的44.3%降至40%。雖然手續費和佣金收入增加了9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入則下降了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比率由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，原因是營運成本上升8.4%，而營運收入則上升11.8%（見圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備亦由2016年的80億港元減少至73億港元。\n\n# 資產狀況\n\n零售銀行貸款品質在年內顯著提升，不良貸款比率由前一年度的0.72%降至0.54%。 逾期及重組貸款比率亦同步下降，由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（見圖表9）。 類似情況亦見於整個銀行業，其不良貸款比率和逾期及重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%降至0.67%和0.52%。\n\n銀行住宅按揭貸款組合的質素維持良好，截至2017年底，違約率為0.03%（見圖10）。延期償還貸款比率接近零。年末沒有任何住宅按揭貸款出現負資產情況，與一年前相比，當時有四宗個案。\n\n信用卡貸款的違約率在2017年底維持在0.22%，較去年同期的0.24%略為降低（圖表10）。同期，逾期及重組貸款的總計比率微降至0.31%，較之前的0.33%下降。呆帳率也從2016年的1.92%降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表分析趨勢\n\n銀行業總貸款在2017年增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%大幅上升。信貸需求增加，主要受惠於對全球經濟前景的樂觀預期。由於總存款增長速度慢於總貸款，截至2017年底，整體貸款與存款比率上升至73%，較一年前的68.4%增長。同期，港元貸款與存款比率亦從77.1%上升至82.7%（圖表11）。\n\n內地貸款（包括本地註冊銀行在內地子公司的貸款）在2017年增長17.5%，較2016年的7%增長率高出10個百分點。\n\n# 可交易債務證券持有\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","zh":"# 穩健貨幣體系\n\n儘管對港元匯率的壓力有所減弱，香港外匯及貨幣市場仍維持有序運作，流動性充足。聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的堅實支柱，並在面對各種衝擊時展現出高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標與方向\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元在外的匯率穩定，即在匯率市場上，港元兌美元的匯率維持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元的範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵為金管局制度，要求貨幣基礎必須至少由外匯基金持有的美元儲備100%支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供擔保；\n- 政府發行的流通中紙幣和硬幣；\n- 總餘額，即銀行存放在香港金融管理局（HKMA）的清算賬戶餘額總和；\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund Bills and Notes（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，仰賴自動調整利率機制的運作，以及金管局堅定履行港元兌換基金承諾（CUs）。當對港元的需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方兌換基金承諾水平，即每1美元兌換7.75港元時，金管局隨時準備向銀行沽出港元以換取美元。此舉將增加結餘總額，以降低港元利率，從而營造有利於港元遠離強方限位，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區間內的貨幣狀況。反之，若港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方兌換基金承諾水平，即每1美元兌7.85港元時，金管局會向銀行買入港元。此舉將減少結餘總額，以提高港元利率，從而推動港元遠離弱方限位，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。\n\n# 2017 年度回顧\n\n# 匯率之穩健\n\n二零一七年，港元兌美元匯率普遍呈現貶值壓力（見圖一）。主要受惠於港元與美元利率之間的負利差擴大，促使利率套利交易活動增加，港元對美元逐漸走弱，從一月三日的 7.7566 跌至八月二十二日的年內低位 7.8265。然而，在九月下旬至十一月初期間，由於首次公開發售 (IPO) 相關資金需求導致港元流動性收緊，港元匯率有所回升，並在 7.80–7.81 的窄幅區間內穩定交投。年末，港元再次面臨貶值壓力，部分原因反映港元流動性狀況略有改善，以及年底商業對美元的需求增加。總體而言，二零一七年港元匯率市場運作正常。\n\n由於貨幣單位（CUs）並未被觸發，2017 年結餘總額與未償還的外匯基金票據總額基本上維持不變，約為港幣1,225.3億元（見圖表2）。在該年度內，香港金融管理局（金管局）為應對銀行對流動性管理需求的增加，共發行了總額800億港元的額外外匯基金票據。這導致結餘總額在2017年底縮減至港幣179.8億元。發行額外外匯基金票據符合聯繫匯率制度的原則，因為這僅代表貨幣基礎的組成部分發生變化，即從結餘總額轉移至未償還的外匯基金票據。貨幣基礎仍然完全以外匯儲備為支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行同業拆息維持低位，但年底時面臨更大的上行壓力（圖3）。儘管市場對美國聯邦儲備委員會加息及縮減資產負債表有所擔憂，港元銀行同業拆息在前八個月大致仍維持低水平。因此，港元與美元利率之間的負利差在1月至8月間擴大。自9月起，短期港元銀行同業拆息因與首次公開募股（IPO）相關及年底資金需求而大幅上升。相應地，短期港元與美元利率之間的負利差亦有所收窄。總體而言，2017年短期銀行同業拆息大多在基準利率以下成交。\n\n基準利率分別於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，總計上調了75個基點，由1.00%調升至1.75%。此舉反映了美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次上調，總計75個基點，由0.50–0.75%調升至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整，乃依照2009年3月26日公佈的修訂公式執行，該公式規定基準利率將以以下任一者為準：美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限之上浮50個基點，或香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的隔夜及一個月期利率五日移動平均數的平均值。\n\n大致追蹤港元與美元息差的走勢，港元遠期點數的折讓在首三個季度逐步擴大，12個月期港元遠期點數於9月中旬達到約-615基點（如圖4）。在第四季，隨著港元與美元之間的息差負值收窄，港元遠期點數的折讓略為收窄。總體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續有序運作，銀行間流動性充裕。貼現窗口貸款額由2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年創立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的堅實基石，並在歷次區域性及全球性金融風暴中展現出卓越的韌性。香港政府重申對聯繫匯率制度的堅定承諾，而外匯及貨幣市場的持續穩定，進一步鞏固了此承諾的可信度。市民對港元作為支付工具及價值儲存手段的信心同樣堅定。國際貨幣基金組織於二零一七年對香港進行的第四次諮詢，亦重申對聯繫匯率制度的支持，認為其仍然是香港最適合的匯率安排。配合健全的金融監察及監管、審慎的財政管理以及靈活的市場機制，聯繫匯率制度有助香港順利應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯繫匯率制度仍是香港的最佳制度。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS（聯繫匯率制度）的正常運作至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、物業相關及與內地相關貸款的監管工作，以增強銀行體系的韌性。隨著美國聯邦儲備系統持續推進貨幣政策正常化，香港美元利率亦將逐步趨於正常。香港金融管理局重申，在LERS的設計下，資金外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方保證金制度及貨幣基礎減少，均是港元利率正常化的必要過程。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並做好應對潛在金融動盪的準備。\n\n為提高外匯基金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分指定用於支持貨幣基礎。背書比率（定義為背書資產除以貨幣基礎）在2017年維持在106.7%至108.2%之間，未觸及上浮或下浮觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率收市報108.1%（圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用作背書投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。若遇突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源將提供堅實的後援，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他項目\n\n香港金融管理局的外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣局子委員會（CBC）負責監察及審核與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2017年，該委員會審議了多項議題，包括香港樓宇短期走勢的影響因素、HIBOR（香港銀行同業拆息率）與倫敦銀行同業拆息率（LIBOR）的利差、物業估值變動對中國內地企業貸款的影響，以及按揭貸款償還負擔對香港私人消費的影響。該委員會就這些議題的討論紀錄，以及提交給該委員會的貨幣局運作報告，均在香港金融管理局網站上發佈。\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR 著重政策相關性，調整其活動方向。這尤其體現在其研討會活動及訪問學者計劃上。HKIMR 與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦更多以政策為中心的研討會。同時，自2016年推出的主題研究訪問學者計劃，亦持續支持更多與香港金融管理局（HKMA）關注的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）於2017年接待了18位研究員，並發表了29篇工作論文。同期，中心亦舉辦了四場國際會議及研討會：\n- 第八屆國際中國經濟年會於一月在香港舉行，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：發展方向為何？」。是次年會匯集了來自學術界、政策制定者及商業經濟學家的代表，共同探討與中國內地經濟相關的重要議題。年會發表了11篇高品質的研究論文，內容涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革、國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策框架與傳導機制等。\n- 7月份舉行了第十五屆HKIMR夏季研討會，旨在為HKIMR及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的研究人員提供一個展示研究成果的平台，並促進學術交流。\n- 香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行（BIS）於8月聯合舉辦了主題為「匯率的價格、實質及金融影響」的研討會，為與會者提供了一個深入探討的機會。研討會涵蓋了匯率制度、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備累積過程中的風險管理，以及外匯市場的運作等議題。\n- 香港金融管理局、美國聯邦準備理事會（Federal Reserve Board）及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行（Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta）共同贊助的研討會於10月舉行，主題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗與啟示」。是次研討會回顧了過去十年主要央行實施非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗，探討了低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興經濟體的影響、UMP與銀行信貸，以及UMP對實體經濟與金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續將監管重點放在授權機構的風險治理架構有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，為加強銀行業應對樓市下行風險的韌性，金管局再推出一輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施。面對日益增加的網絡威脅，金管局亦加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，金管局推出七項措施，為香港邁向新時代的智能銀行做好準備。為有效打擊金融犯罪，金管局持續關注授權機構反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施的有效性。在行為監管方面，金管局進一步推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融普惠，並解決中小企業及初創公司在香港開立及維持銀行賬戶所遇到的困難。同時，金管局亦加強對授權機構投資及保險產品銷售手法之監管，以進一步強化客戶保障。\n\n在本地實施國際監管及會計準則方面已取得顯著進展，包括資本充足率準則、披露準則、淨穩定資金比率、大額信貸風險敞口限制、復甦計劃以及國際財務報告準則第9號。為應對瞬息萬變的銀行環境及不斷演變的風險格局，金管局與業界協調，共同開發董事賦權計劃及銀行從業員能力發展框架。\n\n《金融機構（處理）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨部門有序重組或清算機制的金融穩定委員會成員管轄區之一。該條例為金融穩定設立新的防線，賦予貨幣管理局權力，在金融機構出現可能對金融體系造成不利系統性影響的情況下，以有序方式管理該機構的失敗。\n\n# 目標與方向\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於金融體系具備高度韌性，並能為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務運作，或在萬一出現極端情況導致混亂倒閉，均可能影響金融系統的穩定性。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，透過確保銀行具備應對衝擊的能力，並能在危機發生時恢復其正常運作，從而有助於預防銀行倒閉。 金融管理局負責在香港對銀行業務進行審慎監管，包括吸收存款業務。 其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構統稱為授權機構（AIs）。 金融管理局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施（金融市場基礎設施，簡稱FMIs）。\n\n金管局無法保證，亦無香港的審慎監管框架旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反地，金管局作為解決機制，致力於確保在金融機構（包括人工智能）出現問題時，能夠有序進行解決程序，以確保該等機構向客戶提供的關鍵金融服務得以持續。為此，香港已建立一套金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，金管局負責處理包括人工智能在內的金融機構的解決事宜。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了192次現場以外的審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括持牌機構（AIs）的CAMEL評級（一種評估金融機構財務狀況的指標）1、公司治理、業務運作及風險管理。為持續推動持牌機構加強風險管治，HKMA與持牌機構董事會或董事會級別委員會舉行了30次會談，重點討論重要的風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監測其最新公司治理指引的落實情況。此外，HKMA、持牌機構及其外部審計師之間亦舉行了27次三方會談。\n\n金管局除進行場外活動外，持續進行定期現場檢查，並配合針對評估風險較高的範疇進行主題審查。此舉有助金管局優先調配監管資源，專注於受規管機構所面臨的新興及更重要的風險。年內，金管局共進行了401次現場檢查及主題審查。信貸風險管理及監控仍然是這些審查和審核的重點。另一個主要關注點是科技風險及運作風險管理。金管局同時增加了海外檢查的數量，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（反洗錢\/反恐融資）監控的現場檢查和主題審查數量。此外，由專門團隊亦有對受規管機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險監察\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n銀行總貸款增長了16.1%，相比2016年的6.5%增長。如表2所示，貸款增長覆蓋面廣。\n\n截至2017年底，與中國內地相關的貸款增長17.5%，達到4,188億港元（見表3）。其中，包括由在香港註冊銀行附屬公司發放的644億港元貸款。\n\n2017年，金融機構資產質素維持健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%下降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2.2%。整體銀行業的不良貸款比率則從0.85%降至0.67%。至於與內地相關的貸款，零售銀行該類貸款的不良貸款比率在2017年降至0.75%，較2016年的0.82%略為下降。銀行業整體的相關比率也從去年同期的0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n本年度內，香港金融管理局加強了監管力度，以確保持牌機構持續遵守謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。尤其在監察持牌機構對主要企業的信貸風險方面，監管工作有所加強。為此，金融管理局進行了有針對性的主題檢查，重點關注貸款審批準則、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險監管架構，以及針對房地產發展商、資產擔保融資及保險費融資的信貸風險管理。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n二零一七年物業價格持續上升。同時，銀行同業結算體系批出更多貸款予持有多按揭或收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人。 鑒於此等發展，金管局於五月十九日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高銀行同業結算體系為計算新住宅按揭貸款資本充足率而適用的風險加權底線，降低向已持有按揭的借款人批出物業按揭貸款所適用的成數比率上限，以及降低向主要收入來源來自香港以外地區的借款人批出物業按揭貸款所適用的債務償還比率上限。\n\n香港金融管理局自2009年起實施的物業按揭貸款宏觀審慎措施，有效提升了銀行應對房地產市場風險的能力。在首次引入反週期措施前，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%降至2017年12月的49%。同期，平均債務服務比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%降至2017年12月的35%（見圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局觀察到，部分發展商以高負債方式為其物業發展項目提供融資，並有部分發展商向買家提供高按揭成數的按揭貸款。為應對相關風險，金管局於五月十二日推出新的風險管理措施，規管向物業發展商的貸款。這些措施包括：要求持牌銀行降低建築融資的融資上限；要求持牌銀行為向貸款與股權比例較高的物業發展商的貸款，增加更多資本；以及進行一輪主題式檢查，以確保銀行在向物業發展商提供貸款時，繼續遵守審慎的承銷標準。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局於二月與土地註冊處合作推出電子提示服務。當有關物業的按揭登記進一步送交土地註冊處時，該服務會通知相關的按揭銀行，以便銀行能適時採取風險減輕措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監督\n\n網絡安全威脅在一年內持續增加。香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了監管措施，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為香港金融管理局於2016年推出的「網絡安全強化計劃」（CFI）的一部分，30間銀行完成了對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。另外，管理局與證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）在與銀行及證券業進行廣泛諮詢後，共同決定引入強制雙因素認證，以用於網上股票交易。同時，亦進行了一輪現場審查，專注於銀行網絡安全控制措施及運營韌性。管理局進一步與主要銀行的高級管理層進行了一輪討論，評估銀行如何應對潛在新進入者因科技進步而帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智能銀行\n\n九月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布一系列措施，協助香港銀行業邁入智慧銀行的新時代。在監管方面，金管局將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行及科技公司均可使用的聊天室，以及建立金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局（IA）沙盒之間的聯繫，以便為跨領域金融科技產品的測試提供單一入口。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出了「優化銀行服務體驗」計劃，旨在識別及減低監管摩擦，從而進一步提升客戶使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的體驗。已成立專責小組，目前重點關注遠程開戶及帳戶管理、網上金融及網上資產管理。\n\n現已展開對現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的審視，以為香港虛擬銀行營運鋪路。\n\n# 庫務活動監察與流動性風險管理\n\n隨著美國持續調整其貨幣政策，全球資金流動性或將面臨更大的波動。為應對此情況，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在年內加強了對流動風險的監管。金管局進一步完善了監管壓力測試，納入更多情境，包括資金外流的更具壓力但合理的應急情境，以及短期市場信心驅動的銀行擠兌情景。金管局同時加強了對各授權金融機構流動性狀況的監測與分析，並要求部分機構提升其流動風險管理能力。\n\n金管局亦有就授權機構（AIs）的債務證券投資組合，進行更多現場檢查，以評估其市場風險管理情況。為評估授權機構增加投資外幣債券所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相關風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖策略，已進行一輪主題審查。\n\n# 防範洗錢及恐怖主義融資（ML\/TF）\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》已於二零一七年六月二十三日刊憲，並將於二零一八年生效。是次修訂旨在根據金融行動特別工作組（FATF）最新制定的國際要求，更新香港的反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資監管制度。此等變動，連同有關反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資的法定指引更新，將有助於明確並實施以風險為本的方法於客戶盡職調查（CDD）程序中，涵蓋開戶及維持合法客戶的過程，並鼓勵在遠程進行此等程序時的創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新措施有效促進了銀行及支付業界金融科技的發展及應用，受到各方廣泛歡迎。透過一系列網絡建設及能力提升的工作，香港作為基礎建設投資融資樞紐的國際形象進一步提升。債券通的推出，強化了香港作為連接中國內地投資機會的重要橋樑的地位。香港金融管理局在企業資金管理等其他領域的努力亦持續取得成效。\n\n# 總覽\n\n香港金融管理局於九月宣布啟動七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新時代作準備。這些措施包括：\n- 發展快速支付系統（FPS），以實現數字零售支付的全面互聯；\n- 引入開放API框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才發展；\n- 推動跨境金融科技合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；\n- 簡化虛擬銀行牌照申請流程；及\n- 推廣「銀行輕鬆辦」計劃，旨在減少客戶在數碼體驗中的監管障礙。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及相關銀行部門，在推動這些措施，提升香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位方面，發揮了重要作用。\n\n香港作為基礎建設融資樞紐的國際地位進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，香港金融管理局基礎建設融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴數量已增至87個，較其成立初期的約40個大幅增加。當年，IFFO 組織並參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，以促進主要合作夥伴之間的經驗交流。尤其值得一提的是，IFFO 在首次債券融資及投資者圓桌論壇上，主導了基礎建設股本投資參考協議的制定，旨在提升基礎建設項目的融資可行性及投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月正式啟動，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互聯互通的又一重要里程碑，進一步鞏固了香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的關鍵樞紐地位。年內，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度增至五千億元人民幣，較之前為二千七百億元人民幣。香港持續保持全球最大規模的離岸人民幣流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動蓬勃發展，體現在我們的人民幣即時大額結算系統（RTGS）的高交易量，以及香港在全球人民幣支付業務中佔據領先地位。\n\n自2016年引入企業資金集中營運中心（CTCs）稅制後，香港金融管理局加強了外展工作，旨在吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立資金集中營運中心。截至2017年底，已有超過40間企業向香港金融管理局表示，它們正積極籌劃或已在香港設立相關營運。\n\n金管局積極參與國際討論，就影響全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題貢獻意見。金管局總裁於四月擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管與監督合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導討論關鍵的金融穩定議題。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務中心奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四個銀行間即時結算系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）的系統可用性達致100%，超出目標99.95%。為支持「債券通」北向交易，CMU已與兩間內地中央結算機構設立帳戶，以便利「債券通」交易的結算，並代表相關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業界的整體安全及效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於八月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定四個零售支付系統（RPS），納入HKMA的監管範疇。HKMA同時亦對十六間積極推出新產品及服務的儲值支付工具（SVF）發牌機構進行監管，致力為客戶提供更多選擇和更優質的使用體驗。另外，電子支票（e-Cheque）及電子帳單呈交及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與廣東省全境之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年總結\n\n# 香港亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行舉措\n\n面對快速科技發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布七項措施，旨在協助香港邁入智慧銀行新時代，並推動銀行業提升至更高層次，把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n智慧銀行將提供零售客戶與企業客戶之間的全面互聯互通，讓金融服務與交易得以在高度流動性、速度、便利性和安全性下進行。\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業及金融科技界緊密合作，並在推行七項措施方面取得顯著進展。\n\n# 迅捷支付\n\nFPS 是一個多幣種平台，讓公眾可透過手機號碼或電郵地址，隨時輕鬆進行資金轉賬。系統支援港幣及人民幣支付，銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與，實現所有支付參與者的互聯。系統開發工作已接近完成，FPS 預計將於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局帶領一個工作小組，成員包括主要的信用卡發卡機構、銀行、持牌儲值支付機構以及商戶收單機構，共同制定香港零售支付的統一二維碼標準。 統一的二維碼標準將有助於商戶使用單一二維碼接受來自多家支付服務提供商的二維碼支付方案，為商戶和顧客提供更大的便利。 工作小組已完成相關技術規格，並將協定具體的實施安排。\n\n# 應用編程接口\n\n開放API 讓銀行數據可供第三方應用程式使用，以促進銀行及其他行業服務的整合，更易於應用。用戶因此可以在單一系統上便捷地享受安全環境下的整合服務。為促進銀行業界對開放API的發展及應用，香港金融管理局已制訂一份開放API架構草案，內容包括一系列開放API功能、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商管理、促進措施及維護模式，現正展開為期兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n其中一項主要研究專案探討分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年發布首份DLT白皮書後，2017年10月再發布了第二份。該白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證專案，分別為貿易融資、數位身分管理及抵押貸款申請。此外，針對銀行和支付產業導入DLT時可能面臨的治理、法律合規及一般控制原則等問題，白皮書也提供了相關建議。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德南先生，於香港金融管理局金融科技日宣布發佈關於區塊鏈技術的第二份白皮書。\n\n香港金融管理局主導的貿易融資概念驗證工作成功後，香港七家銀行決定推廣該原型系統，並正式推出名為「香港貿易融資平台」（HKTFP）的系統，旨在透過數位化貿易文件、自動化流程，提升整體貿易流程效率，並降低信用風險。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才儲備，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作啟動了「金融科技人才加速計劃」。計劃反應熱烈，共收到來自421名申請人的超過3,000份申請。最終，74名學生接受了香港金融管理局及12間銀行的實習機會，自7月起參與為期六個月或一年的金融科技相關項目。\n\n# 跨境協作\n\n為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的初步步驟，我們將與深圳市合作，發展金融科技和人才。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室於六月簽訂協議，(i) 為金融科技公司提供互惠的軟著陸支援；(ii) 聯合舉辦深港金融科技獎，於十月表揚兩地卓越的金融科技產品及方案；及(iii) 為香港學生安排在深圳市金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局首席行政員陳德棣先生（中），於香港金融管理局金融科技日，與中國銀行保險監督管理委員會主任何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席李兆基博士（右）簽署並交換有關過渡安排的諒解備忘錄。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎電子宣傳小冊子\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務管理局簽訂金融科技合作協議，涵蓋創新項目、創新企業引介、資訊交流及專業知識分享。\n\n於十一月，香港金融管理局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署備忘錄，共同建設全球貿易連通網絡（GTCN），將新加坡國家貿易平台與香港貿易金融平台（HKTFP）連接，構建跨境分布式账本技術基礎設施，以實現跨境貿易及貿易融資流程的數位化，使其更安全、更高效且更具成本效益。這將是一個開放平台，歡迎其他有意參與的地區未來加入。GTCN預計將於二零一九年第一季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年9月推出的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）已升級為FSS 2.0，以加速與銀行及科技公司的溝通，促進新理念和新舉措的發展。具體而言，FSS 2.0新增以下功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管對話室，以便在金融科技項目初期階段向銀行及科技公司提供意見。\n- 科技公司可透過對話室尋求意見，直接使用FSS，無需經由銀行。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及保險業監理局的沙盒已聯動，為跨行業金融科技產品的試點計劃提供單一入口。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS已測試了28項新技術產品。其中14項試點已完成，相關產品隨後陸續推向市場。\n\n# 銀行服務更易用方案\n\n簡化銀行服務計劃已推出，旨在減少阻礙科技創新的監管摩擦。已成立專責小組，目前重點關注以下領域：\n- 遠距開戶及帳戶管理\n- 線上金融\n- 線上財富管理\n\n# 數位銀行\n\n虛擬銀行，由於沒有實體分行，預計將為香港金融科技的應用注入更多活力，並為客戶帶來更具創新性的流動及數碼銀行體驗。它們亦有助於促進金融包容性，因為它們通常服務於零售市場，無論是個人還是中小企業。香港金融管理局已著手檢討現有的《虛擬銀行授權指引》，旨在為虛擬銀行在香港的發展鋪平道路。\n\n# 智慧銀行新時代\n\n# 引導與創新\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）去年公布的七項倡議，旨在為香港邁入智慧銀行新時代作準備，這是一項涉及金管局各部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為一股強勁的趨勢，金管局銀行監察執行董事陳瑞龍表示，作為監管機構，金管局必須積極應對這項新趨勢，密切關注最新的科技發展，並適時調整監管思維和方法，從而將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新高度。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 香港匯豐銀行學術基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 呈交財政司司長獨立審計師報告\n\n# 意見\n\n本人確認已審計載於第157至243頁的交易所基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）財務報表，包括交易所基金及集團於2017年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收支表、綜合收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，其中包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n管理層認為，截至二零一七年十二月三十一日止，該基金及集團的財務報表真實而準確地反映其財務狀況，以及截至該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港財務報告準則」）編製，且符合根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官的指示適當編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我依照《交易所基金條例》第7條行政長官發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據該等準則，我的職責已在我的報告中「審計財務報表的審計師職責」一節中進一步闡述。我依照該等準則，保持獨立於本集團，並已履行其他專業道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據充分且適當，為我提供發表意見的依據。\n\n# 重點審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指，根據我的專業判斷，於截至2017年12月31日止年度對財務報表進行審計時，最具重要性的事項。 這些事項是在審計財務報表整體過程中處理，並作為形成審計意見的依據，我對這些事項不提供獨立意見。\n\n# 備註資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資訊。該等資訊包含香港金融管理局2017年年度報告內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及該等財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見僅限於此，不對其他資訊提供任何形式的保證。\n\n就我對財務報表的審核而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估這些資訊是否與財務報表或我在審核過程中獲得的資訊存在重大差異，或是否明顯存在重大錯誤。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為這些資訊存在重大錯誤，我將會報告此情況。總之，目前我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 香港金融管理局及匯風諮詢委員會審計委員會就財務報表的職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表應按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，作出真實而公允的列報，並負責建立貨幣管理局認為必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表無重大錯報，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，若有需要，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n香港儲備基金諮詢委員會的審計小組負責監察本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師之財務報表審計責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯報，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水準的保證，但並非表示依照相關審計準則進行的審計，必然能發現所有存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合併起來，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所做的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計，我於整個審計過程中行使專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n- 識別並評估財務報表可能存在的重大錯誤陳述風險，無論該風險源自詐欺或錯誤，設計並執行適當的審計程序，並取得充分且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。由於詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制之上，因此未能察覺因詐欺導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤導致的風險；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但此目的並非用以表達對集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n- 評估金融監管機構所採用的會計政策是否適當，以及會計估計及其相關披露是否合理；\n- 對金融監管機構使用持續經營假設的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中提請關注財務報表中的相關披露，若披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我出具審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露資訊，並評估財務報表是否以實現公允呈列的方式反映基礎交易及事件；以及\n- 取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以就集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊表達意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行，我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與金管局匯兌基金顧問委員會審計小組就審計的計劃範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中發現的重大內控缺陷等事宜進行溝通。\n\n金融管理局匯兑基金諮詢委員會審計小組，我亦會提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向其通報所有可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及如適用，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與聯邦基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項，我確定在本期財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，並因此將其視為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果合理預期會超過此類溝通所帶來的公共利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛\n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金管局根據財政司司長以匯兑基金監管人的身份授權，按照《匯兑基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理匯兑基金。基金的主要職能是維護港元匯率的穩定，以及維持香港的貨幣及金融體系的穩固。\n\n基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：後備投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及策略投資組合。後備投資組合的資產完全與香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎相符。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份，此股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的而購入。經營分部資訊請參閱附註30。\n\n# 二、重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據所有適用之香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 涵蓋所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的指引。此外，亦符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（合稱為「集團」）採用的重要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發布若干新的或經修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於本會計期間首次生效，或可供提前採用。附註3提供有關因首次採納這些準則而導致的會計政策變更的資料（如有），並說明這些變更對本集團於本期及過往會計期間的影響。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n本集團財務報表包括本集團的權益以及於聯營公司及合營企業的投資。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的業務詳見附註十六及十七。\n\n財務報表的編製以歷史成本為基礎，但下列資產及負債除外，其按公允價值列示，詳見後述會計政策：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.11）；及\n- 投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需作出專業判斷、估計及假設，以應用相關政策並決定資產、負債、收入及費用的報告金額。這些估計及假設基於過往經驗及其他被認為合理的因素，其結果有助於評估資產及負債的賬面價值，而此價值通常難以從其他途徑得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所差異。\n\n估計及相關假設將持續進行檢討。若修訂僅影響當期，則於當期認列；若修訂同時影響當期及未來期間，則於修訂期及後續期間認列。\n\n附註十八載列有關投資性不動產公允價值估計所用假設的資料。附註三十六載列有關金融工具公允價值估計所用假設的資料。除涉及這些公允價值估計的會計判斷外，本集團應用會計政策時，並無其他關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團若能從參與該實體中獲取變動回報，且有能力透過其控制權影響這些回報，則視為擁有控制權。評估控制權時，僅考量集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。\n"}
