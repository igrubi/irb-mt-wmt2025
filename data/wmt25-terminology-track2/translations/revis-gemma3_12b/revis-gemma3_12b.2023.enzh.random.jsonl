{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

2023.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

面對逆境的韌性。\n\n在全球經濟成長放緩，且處於利率維持高位的地緣政治緊張局勢影響下，2023年金融市場的主題聚焦於此。這不僅源於俄羅斯與烏克蘭的衝突，以及中國與美國之間的緊張關係，亦包括中東地區的衝突爆發。三月份美國和歐洲的銀行動盪，是自2008年全球金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力事件，進一步影響了市場情緒。主要經濟體面臨貨幣政策收緊所帶來的挑戰，以及對通脹路徑與利率展望的更大不確定性。中國大陸經濟復甦的步伐，也未能完全達到普遍預期。\n\n在全球金融市場的波動與**難以預測**成為「新常態」的背景下，香港再次**證明**了其**知名****適應****能力**，展現出**具韌性**。自**去年**香港**全面**後疫情時代重啟以來，已進行**多項****工作**以**吸引****人民**回流至我們這座**多變**的**城市**，並**重新連繫**他們與香港。香港金融管理局透過舉辦**一連串****大量**國際活動，例如全球財經**領導人**投資**峰會**及與國際清算銀行（BIS）的會議，**幫助**展示我們**活躍**的**城市**，並向全球發出**信息**，說明香港作為一個主要的國際金融中心（IFC），**開放**營商，並**繼續**是行動與創新的中心。目前有**跡象**顯示**逐步****復甦**，這是由於入境旅遊業的**復甦**及**改善**的私人消費所**推動**，**亦**受到**具韌性**的勞動市場及政府**推出**的**不同****支持**措施的**支持**。就**全年**而言，2023年香港的國內生產總值增長從2022年的**負面**領域**回復**至3.2%。\n\n香港金融管理局於2023年進入其第四十年。過去30年見證了經濟和金融市場的劇烈變化，科技推動的進步遠超任何人最狂野的想像。過去三十年累積的寶貴經驗與智慧，使我們有信心面對未來。儘管面對宏觀經濟逆風及不確定的外部環境，香港金融管理局將繼續維護其在香港維護貨幣及銀行體系穩定的職責，並積極推動發展機會，以鞏固這份穩定，並鞏固這座城市作為領先國際金融中心的地位。\n\n前及現任香港特別行政區財政司司長及香港金融管理局總裁於一聚會，慶祝金管局三十週年：（從左）嚴嘉良先生、唐英年先生、曾德成先生、陳茂波先生、余權偉先生、梁錦祥先生、曾俊承先生及陳德霖先生。\n\n# LERS — 經受風雨的考驗\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）去年慶祝40周年，作為一項堅實支柱，支持香港穩健及雄厚的貨幣及金融體系。 過去40年來，制度的有效運作，培育了市場對聯繫匯率制度的信心及其可信性。 貫穿全年，港元匯率維持在可兌換範圍內，港元市場暢順運作，反映了市場對聯繫匯率制度的強大信心，此信心亦獲國際貨幣基金組織及全球市場參與者認可。\n\n背後這份信心，源於香港金融管理局積極主動的公眾及市場活動，連同有效的監測。我們在過去一年不遺餘力與主要持份者溝通，以促進對LERS運作的清晰了解，這在波動時期尤為重要，無論是源於經濟壓力或政治不明朗因素。我們亦加強了對貨幣體系的監測，藉使用交易倉庫的數據集，拓展銀行提供的細粒度數據，以及運用先進的數據分析和人工智能，提升我們的能力，讓能進行更及時和全面的金融穩定及宏觀審慎分析成為可能。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 資料來源，為穩定之基。\n\n儘管包括高息環境、持續的地緣政治緊張及充滿挑戰的信貸環境在內的多重挑戰，香港的銀行體系全年維持穩健，雄厚的資本及流動性緩衝支持著這一切。\n\n截至2023年底，本地銀行綜合資本比率維持在21.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大量銀行的流動性覆蓋比率截至2023年第四季微升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的100%。雖然分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%，但仍低於長期歷史平均值2.0%。此增加主要由對內地私營企業房地產開發商的風險敞口推動；但由於銀行多年來審慎的信貸風險管理，此類風險敞口整體上得到有效控制，銀行業的整體資產品質維持健康。\n\n2023年最令市場參與者驚訝的事，無庸置疑是美國銀行風暴蔓延至歐洲，造成前所未見的系統性銀行壓力，這種情況自2008年全球金融危機以來尚屬首次。香港金融管理局一直保持高度警覺，並在情況發展過程中採取一系列預防性措施，以限制任何潛在的負面影響，並維持本地銀行及金融體系的信心。加上香港銀行所維持的雄厚資本及流動性緩衝，意味著本地銀行業未受風暴顯著影響，即使全球金融市場動蕩，香港銀行業仍具韌性。在此次事件後，香港金融管理局進行全面內部檢討，以汲取經驗，並加強香港金融管理局的監管效能及靈活性，以便應對未來可能出現的銀行危機。\n\n審慎的信貸風險管理固然重要，但我們一直重申監管預期，要求銀行時刻銘記支持實體經濟的需要。隨著新冠肺炎疫情的經濟影響減退，銀行業預先核准的本金付款寬限期於2023年7月開始有秩序地結束，金管局與銀行合作，確保貸款償還逐步過渡至常態，並為持續面臨壓力的借款人提供靈活性。今年較早時候，鑒於部分中小企業即使在疫情結束後仍面臨經營挑戰，金管局推出了9項新措施，進一步協助這些企業取得銀行融資。\n\n在檢討銀行物業貸款與本地物業市場相關的風險後，香港金融管理局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來，首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。此項放寬提高了大多數住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展及投資融資的貸款與價值比率上限。之後於2024年初，暫停了利率壓力測試要求。\n\n香港金融管理局對金融機構的監管一直與時並進。近期全球詐騙情況急劇增加，我們已加大力度，推出一套全面的措施，以保障銀行客戶。這些措施包括加強銀行與執法機構之間的信息共享；收緊對可疑交易的監控，例如實施即時詐騙監控及收緊支付卡認證；授權客戶對其支付卡擁有更多控制權；以及推出《反詐騙消費者保障憲章》及交易前警示機制，提升客戶及公眾對詐騙的警覺性，當識別到較高風險的快速支付系統（FPS）交易時，會向用戶發出警告。\n\n鑑於創新及數碼銀行產品及服務的快速增長，香港金融管理局（HKMA）與銀行業界合作，加強消費者及投資者保護，提升銀行的運作及網絡韌性，以及對系統性網絡事件的集體防禦。同時，各主要銀行已大幅加強應對及從具破壞性勒索軟件攻擊中復甦的能力。香港金融管理局與業界亦合作推行不同消費者數據基礎設施項目，例如「信貸數據智」試驗計劃，以提升消費者信貸參考服務，並推動一項跨邊界信貸參考倡議，便利企業的跨境融資活動。\n\n金融科技和數字化在風險得到妥善管理的情況下，可以帶來巨大的機會。藉著較早成功推動Regtech的採用，香港金融管理局（HKMA），在證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）和保險業監理機構的支持下，於2023年8月載有新的金融科技推動路線圖，以推動金融機構在五個重點範疇——Wealthtech、Insurtech、Greentech、人工智能和分布式分類帳技術——進一步發展金融科技。我們預期本地監管機構將繼續與各行業緊密合作，在未來幾年內，以便香港金融業整體能緊貼並把握多變金融科技發展的優勢。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心——行動與創新的中心\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's analyze these translations. Overall, the junior translators have done a decent job, demonstrating a good understanding of the text and the dictionary terms. However, there's significant variation in fluency, naturalness, and adherence to Traditional Chinese phrasing.\n**Common Strengths:** Most translations correctly incorporate the dictionary terms. They generally capture the core meaning of the original text.\n**Common Weaknesses:**\n*   **Overly Literal Translations:** Several translations are too literal, resulting in awkward phrasing. For example, \"回歸\" (return) for \"return of global investors\" feels a bit stiff. \"回復\" is better.\n*   **Redundancy:** Some phrases are repetitive or unnecessarily verbose. For instance, repeatedly stating \"對...而言\" (for...而言) becomes tiresome.\n*   **Word Choice:** While dictionary terms are used correctly, the surrounding vocabulary sometimes lacks nuance or sounds unnatural. \"刊載於\" for \"included\" is a particularly odd choice.\n*   **Grammatical Issues:** Minor grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures appear in several translations.\n*   **Cultural Appropriateness:** While not a major issue, some phrasing could be more aligned with typical business communication in Hong Kong.\n**Specific Observations by Translator:**\n*   **Translator 1:** A solid translation, but slightly verbose. The phrasing is generally good, but could be more concise.\n*   **Translator 2:** Good use of vocabulary, but \"強化\" (strengthened) feels a bit too strong in some contexts. The use of \"重臨香港\" (re-visited Hong Kong) for the summit is a bit dramatic.\n*   **Translator 3:** \"香港金融管理專員處\" is a less common and slightly more formal way to refer to the HKMA than \"香港金融管理局.\" The phrasing is generally a bit clunky.\n*   **Translator 4:** \"尤為重要\" (particularly important) is a bit too emphatic. The overall flow is good, but some phrasing could be refined.\n*   **Translator 5:** The use of \" демонстрировать\" is completely inappropriate and suggests a misunderstanding of the task. The phrasing is also quite awkward in several places.\n*   **Translator 6:** \"接任\" (took) is not the best fit for \"host\" in this context. \"主辦\" is more appropriate. The phrasing is generally good, but could be more concise.\n**Prioritization for Improvement:**\n1.  **Fluency and Naturalness:** Prioritize phrasing that sounds natural to a native Traditional Chinese speaker in a business context.\n2.  **Conciseness:** Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases.\n3.  **Word Choice:** Select vocabulary that is precise and nuanced.\n4.  **Grammar:** Ensure correct grammar and sentence structure.\n5.  **Dictionary Adherence:** Double-check that all dictionary terms are used correctly and appropriately.\n**My Approach:** I will aim for a translation that is clear, concise, and fluent, using the dictionary terms accurately while prioritizing natural-sounding Traditional Chinese phrasing. I will avoid overly literal translations and strive for a professional tone suitable for a financial report. I will also favor \"香港金融管理局\" over \"香港金融管理專員處.\"<\/end>\n在2023年，我們已充分走出疫情陰霾。香港不僅回復了商業活動，而且在全球投資者回歸及我們加強的全球網絡支持下，其作為世界領先的國際金融中心之一的地位進一步得到鞏固。在本地，我們把握香港金融管理局成立三十週年的機遇，主辦了一連串大型國際活動，邀請全球金融與銀行界高層參與，以展現香港的活力，並傳達一個明確的信息：香港作為國際金融中心，對力求增長與創新的全球投資者及金融機構而言，維持相關且不可或缺。尤其值得注意的是，11月舉行的全球金融領導人投資峰會重現，吸引了來自約160家全球金融機構的350多位國際及地區領導人來港參與。其他在香港舉辦的高級別活動包括巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（巴塞爾委員會）會議，以及兩場香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行（BIS）合辦的會議，這些聚會是當年中央銀行行長與銀行監管人員中規模最大的。這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的信心與承諾。\n\n對外而言，2023年也是香港積極力求加強與包括美國和歐洲在內的傳統市場，以及中東等新興目的地聯繫的一年。我們與這些市場的同業監管機構及全球金融機構高層會面，向他們介紹香港及內地的機會，同時力求為香港尋找新的合作機會。\n\n為配合這些聯繫努力，我們積極佔據國際及區域組織的工作，並擔任若干領導角色。在過去一年，我接受了主持主要新興市場經濟體中央銀行總裁會議及擔任金融穩定委員會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組聯席主席的邀請。我的同事亦擔任或聯席主席巴塞爾銀行監管委員會、金融行動特別小組以及東亞太平洋中央銀行高層會議等許多其他重要小組。香港金融管理局在多間區域及國際組織中展現領導力，是對香港在國際中央銀行及監管工作方面的專門知識和貢獻的肯定，以及對香港作為國際金融中心的重要性的推動。\n\n為持續發揮上述成就，我們必須定位為具前瞻性的IFC，保持領先地位，以確保我們的持續競爭力。我們已識別出未來數年將塑造我們未來的三大長期趨勢，即內地持續開放、綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及金融科技的應用。我們將繼續支持金融市場的發展，把握這些長期趨勢所帶來的機會，同時將我們的金融平台定位為提供領先服務，以吸引更多業務來港。有關我們在綠色及可持續金融方面的工作詳情，讀者可參閱我們的可持續發展報告2023。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and

2023年摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年呈現正面增長，主要推動因素是入境旅遊和本地需求的復甦。勞工市場繼續改善，並隨著經濟復甦而持續保持溫和。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和的步伐進一步復甦，雖然前景蒙上陰影，存在多個不明朗因素。\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年繼續健康，得益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝。資產質素保持健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將維持較長時間的情況下，港元於2023年大部分時間在可兌換範圍的疲弱一側交易，弱方兌換保證在2月中至5月初期間被觸發8次。港元匯兌及貨幣市場保持穩健，並繼續以暢順且有秩序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年是聯繫匯率制度的40周年。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度幫助香港抵禦過去四十年的一系列震盪和危機，展現了該制度的韌性和穩健性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n金管局迅速應對三月份美國及歐洲的銀行動盪——從管理後續影響到完成內部檢討，汲取經驗以供本地銀行業參考，同時維持其對銀行信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的重點關注。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加，以及第三方提供的科技服務使用不斷增加，金管局亦緊密與銀行合作，強化其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局提升支付卡的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂銀行行為準則以及反詐騙消費者保護憲章。金管局與其他監管機構合作，建立平衡的虛擬資產相關活動監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，引入提升措施至跨境理財通試點計劃，並開始監管信託業務。亦推出名為「信貸數據智策」的消費者信貸參考服務試驗計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資方面的努力展現了對應對風險為本方法下最高威脅的承諾。為應對增加的數碼詐欺，香港金融管理局加強了生態系統合作，推出即時詐騙監測，提升銀行與執法機構之間的資訊共享，加強公眾教育，並推出新的交易前警示機制，以應用於快速支付系統。與此同時，透過宏觀分析試點計劃，監管科技能力已得到先進。\n\n香港金融管理局在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率及披露，並在加強銀行業能力建設方面作出顯著努力。\n\n香港金管局亦推進其工作，以確保具信譽的決議機制，包括制定關於存取關鍵金融市場基礎設施的新決議標準，以及完成對損失吸收能力政策標準執行的檢討。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會及香港金融管理局與銀行國際結算署高層次會議的順利舉行，展現全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港的有關當局緊密合作，以深化和擴大香港與內地金融市場之間的互聯互通。這包括提升跨境理財通計劃，指定額外做市商於債券通下進行南向交易，順利推出交換通北向交易，以及推出港幣人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台做市計劃，所有這些措施均有效鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球中心的地位。\n\n加強香港金融平台的競爭力，在債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續金融，以及企業財務中心等範疇取得顯著進展。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續在「金融科技2025」策略的各個方面取得重大進展。項目mBridge進入最小可行產品發展階段，電子港幣先導計劃第一期已完成，商業數據交換的使用率持續增加，並與政府資料來源順利對接。此外，也宣布了一項新的金融科技推廣路線圖，以進一步發展銀行業的財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智慧及分布式分類帳技術。與此同時，快速支付系統迎來五周年，其應用持續拓展，包括與泰國的PromptPay進行跨境二維碼支付的對接等新功能提升。在制定穩定幣發行商監管制度的方面亦取得重大進展，並已載有就立法建議徵求意見的諮詢文件。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n儘管投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰，交易所基金仍成功取得2,260億元的良好投資收益，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續其資產多元化及負責任投資的努力。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年以來，錄得年化內部回報率11.8%。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過不同渠道與社區及市場保持積極聯繫，以推動公眾對其政策和運作的了解。\n\n在內部，香港金融管理局致力於建立一支靈活應變且專業的員工隊伍，維持嚴格的財務紀律，並提升其數碼能力以適應變化，確保政策及倡議的有效執行。"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

2024年工作重點及前瞻\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預期將繼續以溫和的步伐復甦，受益於入境旅遊持續復甦、公共基礎設施項目以及穩健的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險和不明朗因素，加上與未來美國政策利率路徑、全球增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張相關的因素。儘管如此，香港的金融體系繼續具備良好的基礎，因其韌性及多年累積的充足緩衝，能夠抵禦不利的震盪。\n\n香港金融管理局非常重視保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將繼續保持警覺，面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境，力求及時識別新興風險並以靈活應變的方式應對。同時，我們將尋求機會，創造政策空間，以協助進一步提升香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。在這充滿挑戰的投資環境中管理貨幣發行基金，我們將繼續謹慎投資，同時保持靈活，適當採取防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與健全\n\n全球經濟的近期不明朗因素預計將在2024年繼續。香港金融管理局將緊貼最新發展，並對潛在風險保持警惕，目標是鞏固金融體系的韌性和穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕，防範潛在風險。\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景不明朗、地緣政治風險不斷演變，以及全球經濟復甦不均而出現波動。2024年亦是關鍵的選舉年，世界各地將舉行多間主要選舉。這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場的不明朗因素。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉多年來建立的韌性和緩衝機制，能有效應對市場波動。香港金融管理局亦擁有足夠的能力、資源和承諾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續其努力，緊密監察在環境中出現的任何風險和弱點，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦會進行研究，評估並應對影響香港經濟的任何潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n在2023年，世界各地出現新的地緣政治緊張局勢，而其他問題則維持未解決，這對政治不確定性和不穩定性作出貢獻，情況預期將持續至2024年。高利率所帶來的經濟壓力是全球景觀的一個特徵，進入2024年，利率仍然維持高位。在銀行業內，持續朝數位化的發展以及新技術（包括人工智能）的執行，帶來了多間優勢，但也同時帶來了新的營運及安全風險，以及監管挑戰。鑑於如此動盪的政治、經濟和科技環境，香港金融管理局致力透過持續的監管努力，確保銀行具備承受震盪的能力。與此同時，我們將繼續提升和完善我們的銀行監管和法規框架及政策，以考慮科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準和最高實踐。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於日益充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的重點將放在監測授權機構（AIs）的資產質量，並評估其信貸風險管理與控制措施的有效性，尤其在貸款分類與撥備實務及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行及商業行業維持緊密溝通，以確保授權機構在審慎信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡。特別是，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟隨銀行落實2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不明朗因素以及升高的地緣政治緊張，可能增加資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金融管理局將謹慎視為優先，並會繼續更有效地監管AIs的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 跟進行動：從2023年銀行危機中汲取的經驗\n\n香港金管局將推行在回應2023年美國和歐洲銀行業動盪時所進行的內部審查中確定的跟進行動。這些行動將進一步加強監管有效性，並提升其在銀行危機出現時的處理能力。這些包括在金管局的監管審查過程中，加強對持牌機構（AIs）銀行賬簿中利率風險的風險捕捉；改善持牌機構（AIs）在銀行服務繼續數位化的背景下處理流動性壓力的準備；簡化金管局的危機管理流程，以及進一步加強跨機構和跨境的監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續監察銀行機構在達成全面符合金管局監管政策手冊（SPM）模組OR-2「運作韌性」方面的進展，並評估銀行對潛在干擾的限額，以提升整體銀行系統的韌性。 方面網絡風險，我們將監察銀行機構根據網絡韌性評估框架2.0進行一輪新的自我評估，並監察銀行機構執行安全的三重資料備份，以提升其在面對具破壞性的網絡攻擊時的資料復原能力。\n\n鑒於銀行業務數字化轉型的步伐持續加快，香港金融管理局將密切關注源自使用先進科技（例如生成式人工智能和分布式分類帳）而衍生的新風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，建立一個靈活應變且預防性的機制，以應對日益增長的網絡詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n2024年，為維護銀行體系的健全並建立客戶信心，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將重點應對高風險範疇，優先進行風險為本的監管更新，包括發行指引以支持有效執行針對政治敏感人物要求的修改，並支持穩定幣發行機構監管制度的執行。我們亦將發行指引協助人工智能優化其交易監控系統，推動人工智慧的負責任使用，並透過工作重點應對高階洗錢的控制措施。為加強生態系統對數字詐騙的應對並減低受害者損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾和業界，就擴大銀行間資訊共享範圍的建議，從企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶，並基於收到反饋推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過匯集多間銀行與反洗錢相關的數據，全面建置Macro Analytics 3.0，並與現有的生態系統詐騙分析接駁。這將帶來更迅速的跨銀行回應，並進一步提升我們數據驅動的反洗錢及反恐融資監管，讓我們能對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險採取更迅速、更果斷的行動。\n\n# 資產管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將加強對授權機構（AIs）在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的現場檢查及非現場監管。具體而言，我們將重點放在跨境財富管理通關（跨境WMC）業務、數字化分銷及顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期人壽保險產品及保費融資活動，根據最新市場發展以及不斷演進的國際標準。\n\n香港金融管理局將與其他監管機構及銀行業界緊密溝通，適當地提供關於投資、保險及強積金產品銷售的監管標準指引。尤其為支持虛擬資產行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保現行針對虛擬資產行業的監管制度穩健、全面且平衡。\n\n香港金融管理局將便利及監察業界執行跨境WMC的提升措施，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局合作，以進一步提升該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售程序，並在適當情況下整合及澄清指引，以便利業界合規。此外，除信託業務外，我們亦會開始根據《證券及期貨條例》監察由證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）認可的集體投資計劃提供託管服務的資產管理機構（AIs）所從事的新類型13受規管活動，該活動將於2024年10月2日開始運作。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n香港金融管理局旨在根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的不同指引，推動其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全及效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI執行監測及評估工作，並參與其他國際小組商討新的及創新的FMIs相關倡議。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並適當檢討及加強我們的監管要求，以反映最新的國際實務以及市場和科技發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續加強和完善其銀行監管及監管框架和政策，鑑於國際標準和最高實踐。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n擬議修訂《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR），以實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package），預計將於立法會通過修訂後的規則後，於2025年1月1日生效。2024年，香港金融管理局將繼續準備支持規則應用所需的指引、銀行回報及標準披露表格，以便利規則的申請。尤其，我們計劃：\n- 於2024年第2屆季度就SPM模組CA-B-3「逆周期資本緩衝（CCyB）–私人部門信貸風險的地理分配」及回報MA(BS)25「逆周期資本緩衝季度報告」的修訂進行業界諮詢，反映最終改革方案的實施及國際銀行統計報表的修訂所帶來的後續變更；以及\n- 完成有關落實新市場及信貸估值調整風險標準僅需報告要求的配套方案，該要求將於2024年7月1日開始生效。\n\n那些銀行（限額）規則（BELR）和銀行（流動性）規則（BLR）的擬議修訂，主要與修訂後的銀行業規例（BCR）最終方案的執行有關，亦將於2025年1月1日生效。香港金融管理局計劃於2024年完成相關監管回報的建議後續修訂。\n\n與此同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會分別於2022年12月及2023年12月發布了關於銀行加密資產風險敞口審慎管理的新標準，以及針對該標準的後續針對性修訂。本地將於2025年執行該標準。香港金融管理局將審視對不同類別規則（包括BCR、BDR、BELR及BLR）進行潛在立法修訂的需要，並於2025年上半年進行有關必要規則修訂的法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）計劃根據2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行危機的經驗，以及監管要求和國際標準的最新發展，更新多個SPM模塊。這些模塊包括：\n"}
{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introd

關於香港金融管理局\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構。香港金融管理局有四項主要職能：\n- 維持聯繫匯率制度框架內貨幣穩定；\n- 推動金融體系的穩定與健全，包括銀行體系；\n- 協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，包括維持及發展香港的金融基礎設施；以及\n- 管理外匯基金。\n\n# 香港金融管理局的法定職權\n\n香港金融管理局於1993年4月1日成立，當時立法會已在1992年通過修訂《外匯基金條例》，授權財政司長委任貨幣管理局。\n\n金管局的權力、職能和責任，規定於《外匯基金條例》、《銀行條例》、《金融機構（決策）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值設施條例》及其他相關條例。財政司司長與金管局在貨幣及金融事務上的職能和責任分工，載於2003年6月25日的函件。該函件披露了財政司司長向金管局作出的權力轉授。這些函件是公開文件，可在金管局網站上查閱。\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，設立外匯基金，由財政司管理。規定該基金須主要用於影響港元匯價。它可能（同時顧及其主要目的）運用於維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全，藉此維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n貨幣管理局根據外匯基金條例獲委任，協助財政司長履行其根據外匯基金條例的職能，並負責其他條例或財政司長所指派的職能。貨幣管理局的職位稱為香港金融管理局（HKMA），而貨幣管理局是香港金融管理局的行政總裁。\n\n《銀行條例》規定，貨幣當局負有規管銀行業務及吸收存款業務的責任。根據條例，貨幣當局負責香港持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司的認可事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處理）條例》規定貨幣管理局為銀行業機構的處理當局。 貨幣管理局獲賦予一系列權力，以有秩序地處理不可持續經營的銀行業機構（其倒閉可能構成系統性風險）。其目的在於維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公帑。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》提供若干權力予金融管理局，有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務。\n\n根據保險條例，保險業監管局已將銀行保險業務的查察及調查權力轉授給貨幣管理局。\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資條例》授權金管局監管銀行遵守該條例下客戶盡職調查及記錄保存要求。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》規定貨幣當局負責協助存款保障計劃的運作，並在持牌銀行倒閉時，啟動從存款保障計劃基金向存款人支付補償的責任。\n\n《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》規定香港金融管理局可指定及監察若干重大結算及清算系統及零售支付系統。亦授權金融管理局管理針對電子及實體「設施」的牌照制度，該設施用以儲存貨幣價值，且符合條例所規定的準則。"}
{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introdu

公司治理\n\n作為香港的中央銀行機構，金管局致力於維持高標準的公司治理，因為良好的治理對維持和保護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信心至關重要。\n\n為取得其對良好企業管治的承諾，香港金融管理局：\n- 制定清晰的管治架構，並具有高度的問責程度；\n- 實施嚴謹的控制措施，以管理風險，並確保各級員工的行為及其日常運作符合指定標準；及\n- 奉行高透明度和保持開放的政策，並與持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# HKMA 與香港特別行政區政府\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）是香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府的一**部分**，但**能夠**以與公務員**不同**的**條件****聘請**員工，**以便****吸引**具備**適當**的**經驗**和**專門知識**的人員。香港金融管理局行政總裁及其員工均為公職人員。在日常**工作**中，HKMA在**相關**法定權力**於**貨幣管理局**轉授**或**授予**的**範圍內**，享有**高****程度**的自主權。\n\n財政司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣系統的架構：財政司長於2003年6月25日發給香港金融管理局的信函訂明，這些應為穩定的匯率，定義為以約7.80港元兌一個美元的穩健匯價，並由聯繫匯率制度維持。香港金融管理局自身負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括釐定策略、工具及運作方式。香港金融管理局亦在貨幣系統的穩定和健全方面負有責任。\n\n財政司長在金融服務及財政局局長的協助下，對維持香港金融系統的健全及香港作為國際金融中心之地位的政策負有責任。為支持這些政策，金管局的責任包括：\n-

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年呈現正面增長，歸功於入境旅遊和內需的復甦。勞動市場持續改善隨着經濟復甦，而通脹維持溫和。在收緊的金融條件下，資產市場維持軟勢，反映了疲弱的市場情緒。預期2024年經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，雖然前景蒙上陰影，受到多個外部不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在應對了去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟於2023年穩步增長3.2%（見表1及圖1）。在本地方面，私人消費在就業市場狀況改善以及政府推出的不同支持措施，例如消費券計劃及一連串推廣活動的帶動下，顯著回復。儘管財務條件收緊，整體投資支出相較於去年低基數，仍錄得重大增長。對外方面，香港的服務出口因入境旅遊的復甦而反彈，主要歸功於此。然而，其正面影響部分被出境旅遊的強勁復甦所抵銷，後者被視為服務進口。另一方面，商品出口在疲弱的外部需求下維持低迷，拖累了香港的國內生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖1

勞動市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2023年進一步改善，失業率降至7月份的近十年低位的2.8%，其後數個月則徘徊在低位 (圖3)。勞工需求與勞工供應均上升，分別反映於總就業人數的上升 (圖3) 以及勞工人口的增加。鑒於香港人力短缺，政府於2023年推出了不同輸入勞工計劃3和吸引人才措施4。與此同時，由於勞工市場緊俏，名義工資和勞工收入的按年增長率逐步朝疫情前的水平上升。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價通貨膨脹\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況 資料來源：Census and Statistics Department\n\n# 股市\n\n在2023年初穩定後，本地股市在下半年轉趨疲弱。延續2022年底的反彈，恆生指數於27（1月27日）上升至全年高位，收市報22,689點。其後指數回落，並進一步下跌至12月（圖4）的低位，反映了由於3月美國及瑞士銀行業問題，以及下半年全球經濟前景轉弱和金融條件收緊所導致的疲弱市場情緒。恆生指數以17,047點收市，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，標誌連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2023年首四個月，受益於內地及香港復常，出現反彈，但其後隨着利率上升和市場情緒疲弱而回落。整體而言，2023年住宅物業價格按年下跌6.9%，而住宅交易量進一步下跌4.5%，錄得43,002個單位，創下低點。儘管房屋可負擔性略有改善，但仍然維持緊張。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面臨逆風，寫字樓、零售舖位及工廠大廈的價格進一步回落。由於居家工作安排日益普及及供應量大，寫字樓租金持續承受壓力。另一方面，隨著內地旅遊業的復甦和私人物業消費的改善，零售舖位租金在2023年上升。\n\n圖

經濟環境\n\n2024年，香港經濟預期將持續以溫和步伐復甦。入境旅遊將隨着接待能力的持續改善，以及政府推動盛事的努力而進一步擴大，而本地消費活動亦將得到穩定勞動市場的支持。政府將推進的不同基礎設施項目亦會為經濟提供支持。與此同時，香港的貨品出口可能隨着全球科技週期的回升而回穩。政府預測2024年實質本地生產總值將穩步增長2.5%至3.5%。然而，前景蒙上陰影，面臨多個不明朗因素，包括源於美國政策利率路徑、科技週期復甦的步伐、全球經濟增長的前景，以及地緣政治緊張關係。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n本地通脹預期在2024年將維持溫和，回落的外部價格壓力有助於抵銷經濟持續復甦及住宅租金上升對國內成本的向上壓力。市場共識預測2024年的整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府預測整體和核心通脹率分別為2.4%和1.7%。另一方面，勞動市場將受到持續經濟復甦的支持，同時不同勞動輸入及人才吸引計劃將繼續協助紓緩跨不同行業的人力短缺。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面對多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、美國及歐洲三月銀行風波所引發的全球金融市場波動，以及內地和香港經濟復甦速度未達預期。儘管如此，香港銀行業仍維持健康，並持續擁有雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝。儘管分類貸款比率有所增加，銀行業的資產質素仍保持健康。銀行的盈利能力顯著改善，主要推動因素是較高淨利息收入。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n銀行業的分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦由0.85%增加至1.24%（圖5）。與內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率亦由2022年底的2.26%上升至2023年底的2.58%。分類貸款比率的增加主要由於對內地房地產開發商風險敞口的下調（評級）。然而，銀行撥備的數額維持足夠。截至2023年底，撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與分類貸款的比率）為75%。若考慮到分類貸款所擔保的抵押品市場價值，經調整的撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。與此同時，截至2023年底，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率分別維持在0.08%及0.30%的低水平（圖6）。\n\n圖5

盈利趨勢\n\n銀行業錄得顯著的盈利增長於2023年。零售銀行在該年上升了62.1%的稅前經營利潤，而稅後平均資產回報率則從去年同期的0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。盈利的改善主要歸因於淨利息收入的增加（+30%），以及2023年持作交易投資的重大收益，相比去年溫和的虧損。部分抵銷了貸款減損準備金的增加（+28%），因為為新的分類貸款設立了特定撥備。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息率在2023年擴大至1.68%，相比前一年1.31%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本收入比在2023年下降至38.8%，而2022年為48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the

貨幣穩定\n\n在2023年，在市場預期美國政策利率將維持高位的情況下，港元大部分時間在可兌換範圍的疲弱一側交易，自2月中至5月初，疲弱一側的兌換承擔機制被觸發了8次。自5月起，港元回升了一些動力，並在年底約於7.8的中央平價水平交易。在標誌其40周年紀念的聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息利率通常與美元利率掛鈎，同時亦受本地供求影響。整體而言，港元匯率及貨幣市場維持穩健，交易暢順且有秩序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度已多次展現其應對不同外部震盪的強大韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元兌美元在外匯市場的穩定外匯價值，其匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的範圍內。貨幣系統的結構採用貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基地至少有100%的美元儲備作支持，且貨幣基地的變動必須與相應的美元儲備變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基地（表1）包括：\n- 債務證書，該憑證為三家發行紙幣銀行所發行的紙幣提供全面支持；\n- 政府發行並在市面上流通的貨幣紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總餘額，即存於香港金融管理局的結算帳戶餘額總和；以及\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的貨幣發行基金紙幣及紙幣（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局堅定履行可兌換承諾 (CUs) 的承諾而維持。當強方（或弱方）CU 被觸發時，香港金融管理局準備應要求以 HK$7.75 (或 HK$7.85) 美元兌換港元 (或以港元兌換美元)，向銀行沽出（或買入）港元，總結餘額將擴大（或收窄）以拉低（或推高）港元利率，協助將港元回復至 7.75 至 7.85 的可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在市場預期美國利率將維持高位的情況下，2023年香港 dollar 匯率全年大部分時間維持疲弱，主要在可兌換範圍的疲弱面交易。弱方單邊沽匯（CU）被觸發 8 次，時間從 2月中到初五月。香港 dollar 匯率在初五月至七月期間回升，部分原因是上市企業的派發需求以及企業年底的資金需求。此後，香港 dollar 主要受到本地資金需求的變化所推動，例如透過南向股票通的買入資金流，並在年底交易在 7.8 的中央價位約 (圖 1)。整體而言，香港 dollar 匯率市場在 2023 年持續正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2023年市場匯率\n\n從二月至五月，香港金融管理局買入總計515億港元於弱方聯繫匯率機制，應銀行要求，以符合聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計。反映弱方聯繫匯率機制的觸發，總結算餘額由2022年底的963億港元減少至2023年底的450億港元。與此同時，未償還的外匯掉期合約在全年內微升，由1,200.4億港元增至1,245.5億港元。因此，總結算餘額與未償還外匯掉期合約總額由2022年底的1,296.7億港元下跌至2023年底的12,904億港元（圖2）。貨幣基地全年維持充分由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖2 貼現窗口前總餘額及2023年未償還的交換基金紙幣。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBORs）通常跟隨其美元對應利率。由於美國在2023年頭七個月持續上調利率，HIBORs通常也上升（圖3）。全年來看，隔夜、1個月及3個月HIBORs分別上升286、92及16個基點，至年底分別為6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n以下美國聯邦資金利率目標範圍上升後，基地利率經調整上升四項，總計一個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%上升至5.75%。1 在零售方面，以下美國政策利率上調，多間銀行在五月初將最高貸款利率上調12.5個基點，並在年底七月再上調12.5個基點。部分銀行亦在當年提高新核准按揭貸款的HIBOR基準貸款利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的資金市場持續正常運作。貼現窗口貸款上升至2023年的388億港元，較2022年的84億港元，相關使用率未見異常。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率\n\n# 掛鈎匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度在過去四十年來一直是香港金融體系的雄厚支柱，並反映出其應對挑戰的強大與韌性。儘管美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦仍存在持續不明朗因素，香港的美元匯率及貨幣市場持續有秩序地運作，反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。政府堅決支持聯繫匯率制度。在2023年的外匯部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信性已透過一套透明的規則、大量財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政框架得到確保。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續暢順運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率表現良好，符合國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的努力。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中配置特定部分用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）於2022年底為110.12%，至2023年5月4日達到高點112.71%，超過了112.5%的上觸發水平（圖4）。這主要反映了因今年上半年啟動弱方CU所導致的總結餘收縮。根據發行基金顧問委員會核准的安排，並因債務證券的贖回，資產已從支持投資組合轉移至投資組合，以將支持比率減低至2023年5月8日約109.97%。其後，支持比率穩步上升，於12月31日收市為110.73%。根據LERS，雖然有特定發行基金資產被指定用於支持投資組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。發行基金充足的財政資源，加上健康的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的支持。\n\n圖4

考慮了包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩盤、聯邦儲備系統向香港銀行提供美元流動性後備措施的傳導，以及近期港元利率變動等問題。CBC就這些問題的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣委員會運作報告，載有於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n下表總結了2023年底流通中的紙幣和硬幣價值：\n\n圖 5 2023 年底各發行銀行流通紙幣數量\n\n圖6 2023年底流通紙幣的分布\n\n圖7

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年儘管面臨多個挑戰，包括美國及歐洲三月的銀行風波、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張，仍然維持雄厚且具韌性。香港金管局迅速管理三月的銀行風波——從管理漣漪效應到完成內部審查（涵蓋監管範疇和解決框架），汲取經驗，同時維持對持牌金融機構的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的重點。鑑於日益增加的網絡安全威脅以及第三方提供技術服務的使用，香港金管局亦與持牌金融機構緊密合作，提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局提升支付卡方面的消費者保護措施，並透過進一步修訂《銀行業守則》以及推出《反詐騙消費者保護公約》。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，就與虛擬資產相關的活動制定平衡的監管制度，簡化了對高端專業投資者的銷售流程，推出了「跨境理財通試點計劃」的改善措施，並開始對信託業務進行監管。為準備在「信貸數據智能」下提供消費者信貸資料參考服務，推出了試驗計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在打擊洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力展現了其承諾，以風險為本的方式應對最高威脅。為應對增加的數字詐騙，香港金融管理局已加強生態系統合作，透過推出實時欺詐監測，並拓寬公私部門資訊共享合作的範圍，包括「欺詐及洗錢情報工作組」。推出一個突破性平台，以便利銀行間資訊共享，將有助應對幌騙帳戶網絡的風險。同時，香港金融管理局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理增加的與詐欺相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對不同詐騙手法的意識，包括在使用快速支付系統時設有的交易前警示機制。與此同時，監管科技能力亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃有所提升。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和資訊披露等。同時，亦有顯著努力加強銀行業的能力建設，吸引和培育未來人才，並提升現有專業人員的技能。此外，香港存款保障局已完成就建議提升存款保障計劃的公眾諮詢。\n\n金管局持續推動其工作，以確保可信的重組機制。一項與獲取關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新重組標準已制定完成，並且就實施損失吸收能力政策標準的經驗進行了審查。在與銀行進行重組規劃方面取得了重大進展，以應對早期終止風險和運作的持續性。金管局亦持續參與國際政策倡議和區域重組合作。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的普遍目標是推動銀行系統的安全與穩定。達成此目標有賴於一個具韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需 的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可以透過其業務影響系統的穩定性，並在極端情況下，以失序的方式失敗。貨幣當局作為監管機構，擔當保護金融穩定的關鍵角色，透過確保銀行具韌性，能夠在危機中復甦其狀況，最終協助預防失敗。貨幣當局負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責認可香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（Authorized Institutions，簡稱AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣管理局作為負責處理金融機構問題的單位，旨在確保在人工智能機構（AI）不可持續經營時，其倒閉能以有秩序地管理。為此，香港已建立一套針對金融機構的解決規則，根據該規則，貨幣管理局負責處理人工智能機構，以及其他類別機構的問題。為有效推行香港的解決規則，制定相關的政策標準至關重要，同時需要進行解決方案規劃，以消除人工智能機構可解決性的阻礙，並發展貨幣管理局有效處理失敗人工智能機構的能力。為更有效執行這些工作，貨幣管理局採用國際上協調一致的處理方式。\n\n貨幣管理局亦負責若干金融市場基礎設施的指定及監察。於監察金融市場基礎設施時，金管局旨在推動它們的普遍安全及效率，降低系統性風險，並促進透明度。制定更具韌性的金融市場基礎設施，可保障香港的貨幣及金融系統免受金融危機可能產生的動搖影響。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n年內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）核發了一個銀行牌照及一個受限銀行牌照予兩間在香港境外註冊的銀行。香港金融管理局亦向4項外國交易平台營運商批准了貨幣經紀業務，並撤銷了另一個已授予一個貨幣經紀的批准。本年，香港金融管理局撤銷了五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關AIs及香港本地代表辦事處的資訊，可查閱附錄及表格D至F，分別位於第313至316頁及第322至325頁。\n\n# 三級銀行體系分析\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了一項全面審查，以便簡化香港銀行體系的結構。審查發現，現行的三層銀行體系已變得比原來為了在銀行體系入行靈活性與保護小型存款人之間實現的目標更加複雜。其後，香港金融管理局於6月開始進行三個月的諮詢，就簡化三層銀行體系為兩層的建議進行磋商，建議將吸收存款公司合併至受限制牌照銀行部門，從而形成香港銀行體系的第二層。回應者普遍表示支持此建議。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了177項非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理及風險管理。作為香港金融管理局持續推動更強風險治理的努力的一部分，與授權機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，香港金融管理局、授權機構及其外部審計師之間亦舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了離地活動外，香港金融管理局亦定期進行現場審查，覆蓋持牌機構的各類活動。鑒於目前信貸風險環境充滿挑戰，在高息率環境及部分內地房地產發展商違約的情況下，信貸風險管理是重點。隨著持牌機構應用科技的趨勢進一步加速，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦是另一個重點。香港金融管理局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出一輪以氣候相關風險治理為重點的主題審查，以及一連串諮詢環節，以提供指引給持牌機構。\n\n美國及歐洲於2023年3月開始的銀行危機，就規模和範圍而言，是自2008年重大金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力事件。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在危機發展期間保持高警戒狀態，並採取一系列預防行動，以確保任何潛在後果不會影響本地銀行及金融體系的信心。事件過後，HKMA進行內部檢討，顧及從危機中獲得的觀察和經驗。基於此項檢討，HKMA制定詳細計劃，將所學經驗納入其中，以加強監管有效性，並提升處理銀行危機的能力。詳情請參閱第95頁的流動性及市場風險。\n\n在進行監管方面，香港金融管理局在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務以及消費者保護事項上進行現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為較高風險或新措施的範疇進行主題性審查。\n\n表1載有香港金融管理局2023年的監管活動概要。\n\n表1 監督活動概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n2023年總貸款減少3.6%，相比2022年的減少3.0%。表2呈現貸款增長情況。內地相關的貸款在2023年減少6.6%至4,226億港元（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款和推進的增長\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局在高利率環境及內地樓市持續疲弱的情況下，加強監管努力，監測銀行機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理實務。銀行業的資產質素在當年惡化，但維持在可控範圍內。截至2023年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率則由2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局**進行**了針對性及主題性的檢查，以評估金融機構的信貸風險管理，重點關注對**行業**的風險敞口、**優先融資**、對香港以外業務信貸風險的監管，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶面對的現金流壓力\n\n香港金融管理局與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制宣布，於七月開始有序退出預先核准本金支付假期計劃。該計劃於二零二零年五月推出，旨在協助符合資格的企業渡過疫情。鑑於商業行業的意見，部分本金償還選項已提升，以協助企業逐步恢復正常償還。儘管疫情已結束，若個別行業或借款人仍面臨挑戰，銀行將持續根據個案情況提供本金寬限期或其他適合的信貸緩解措施。\n\n香港金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與該計劃但因個別情況而面對現金流壓力的企業的資金需求時，應表現同理心。香港金融管理局提醒銀行在應對遇到償還問題的企業時，應跟隨「香港企業困難處理指引」，以便各銀行能為貸款人的共同利益而合作。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，加強了銀行在物業按揭貸款業務中的風險管理，以及銀行業應對物業價格下跌所帶來的挑戰的能力。2023年核准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與價值比率維持在57%，相比2009年9月首次推出逆周期措施之前的64%（圖1）。2023年新增按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率維持低位，為40%，相比2010年8月首次實施供款與入息比率上限時的41%。\n\n於7月7日，香港金融管理局（HKMA）鑑於樓價、交易量以及本地及外部經濟環境等因素，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年推出住宅物業逆周期宏觀審慎措施以來，首次放寬。調整包括增加住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款與價值比率，以及基於按揭貸款申請人淨資產評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款與價值比率。此外，取消了對主要收入來自香港以外地區的按揭申請人，需將適用的最高貸款與價值比率及供款與入息比率（DSR）限額降低10個百分點的要求。香港金融管理局亦取消了當申請人的總按揭融資超出其正常可接受的貸款與價值比率上限20個百分點時，需對適用的供款與入息比率限額減去五個百分點的要求。\n\n圖1

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局採用多管齊下的方法，取得顯著進展，以鞏固香港作為全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位。\n\n兩項重大活動的成功，即全球金融領導人投資峰會及香港金管局與BIS的高層次會議，鞏固了香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生了正面影響。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局取得努力，以深化和擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。此舉包括提升廣東-香港-澳門大灣區跨境理財通計劃的範圍，指定額外做市商於債券通南向交易，順利推出互換通北向交易，以及推出港幣人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市計劃。這些舉措有效加強了香港的門戶地位，並鞏固了香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局亦取得顯著進展，加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續金融，以及企業資金中心等範疇。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強了其市場外展活動，向海外及內地持份者保持對香港金融市場的了解，並讓他們充分了解其韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局「金融科技2025」策略在各個範疇都取得了重大進展，包括推動金融科技應用、中央銀行數字貨幣、數據基礎建設、人才發展以及政策和資金支持。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）於九月慶祝五周年。註冊數字穩步上升，並在2023年底達到13.6百萬。該系統全年平均每日成交額上升至1.25百萬筆即時交易。FPS x PromptPay跨境QR支付連結於12月與泰國銀行聯合推出，為兩地人士提供快速、安全且方便的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n作為多間國際及區域中央銀行和監管機構的積極成員，香港金管局持續貢獻於維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展的努力。\n\n# 概述\n\n全年，香港金管局持續積極努力，加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在11月，金管局舉辦了第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會。這個為期三天的活動帶來了來自世界各地的知名金融領導人，以「與複雜性共存」為主題，分享他們獨特的視野。有來自160間國際金融機構的350名參加者出席，峰會清楚展示了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。同年同月，金管局與國際清算銀行（BIS）共同舉辦了金管局-BIS高層會議，吸引了逾300名參與者，包括逾20位現任及前央行總裁。會議突顯了金管局與國際清算銀行以及國際央行界的緊密合作。\n\n互聯互通計劃的擴展及提升，已鞏固香港作為內地與國際金融市場之間的橋樑角色。一連串針對跨境財富管理互聯互通（跨境WMC）計劃的提升已推出，以便利跨境零售投資於廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA）。借助南向債券通的暢順運作，香港金融管理局指定9名額外市場製造商，以改善二級流動性並滿足投資者需求。今年成功推出北向交易的掉期互聯互通計劃，讓全球投資者透過香港更好地管理其內地固定收益投資組合所相關的利率風險。\n\n香港的離岸人民幣業務見證了顯著增長。香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易所合作，於6月推出港幣-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市商計劃。這幫助發展了在香港更多元化的等值人民幣產品種類，促進了在香港發行及交易等值人民幣股份。\n\n香港金融管理局持續加強香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其為提升香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。亦取得重大進展，推動香港債券市場創新，並鞏固香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位。同時，金管局加強市場拓展活動，推動香港金融服務向海外及內地持份者推廣。\n\n香港金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融科技（fintech）的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。本年度重點措施包括：\n- 推動在重點科技領域（包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智慧及分布式分類帳技術（DLT））的進一步應用；\n- 推進批發央行數字貨幣（CBDC）的工作，以改善跨境支付；\n- 推進在香港引入零售CBDC（即e-HKD）的前景研究；\n- 加強發展商業數據交換（CDI）的努力；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 透過資金和政策培育金融科技生態系統；\n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；以及\n- 拓寬快速支付系統（FPS）的應用。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，對維持香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2023年，4項銀行間即時全額結算（RTGS）系統、中央結算系統（CMU）及香港交易存管處（HKTR）達成100%系統可用率，超越99.95%的目標。債務證券結算服務，包括北向及南向債券通對接服務，持續運作。\n\nFPS 的應用持續增加，標誌著 FPS 達成五週年的重大里程碑。過去五年，FPS 的註冊數字及成交額持續增長，截至 2023 年年底，註冊數字已增至 13.6 百萬，而全年平均每日成交額較 2022 年上升 33%。FPS 在繳納政府帳單、商戶付款以及為儲值設施（SVF）電子錢包或銀行賬戶增值的使用量增加，成為交易量持續上升的關鍵驅動因素，加上個人對個人及商業付款的穩定增長。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的安全及效率，香港金融管理局監管六項指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監督17間持牌儲值支付工具發行機構（SVFs），其中4項為由持牌銀行發行的SVFs。在本年，香港金融管理局亦持續便利政府消費券計劃的暢順執行，協助協調與該計劃相關的相關部門及委任的SVF發牌機構，並促進他們之間的對話與合作。\n\n金融服務及財富管理局與香港金融管理局（HKMA）聯合發佈了一份有關穩定幣發行機構監管的公開諮詢文件。其後，HKMA於2024年3月12日推出了沙盒安排，針對有意在香港發行法幣掛鉤穩定幣的機構。同時，HKMA亦積極參與國際機構有關加密資產活動的工作，並緊密監測市場的發展。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在國際上一直積極參與中央銀行界，並持續在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。現正，HKMA與巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的政策與標準小組共同擔任主席，亦擔任亞洲區域諮詢小組、非銀行監測專家小組（至6月）以及金融穩定理事會（FSB）金融創新網絡的主席。HKMA亦擔任國際貨幣基金組織（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體（EMEs）央行總裁會議的主席。2018年至2023年間，HKMA連續擔任東亞太平洋央行總裁會議（EMEAP）下設的金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融管理局亦分別於五月份與阿聯酋中央銀行及七月份與沙特阿拉伯中央銀行舉行雙邊會議，以推動亞洲與中東之間的投資及金融市場互聯互通。第六次香港-瑞士金融對話於9月25日在瑞士伯爾尼舉行，討論涵蓋區域及國內展望與政策挑戰、最新發展，以及在可持續金融、金融科技和市場互聯互通範疇的潛在合作。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

儲備管理\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。雖然美國和歐洲的一些銀行在年初出現流動性問題，但相關風險並未蔓延至金融市場。雖然主要發達經濟體的通脹水平已從2023年的高位下跌，但仍維持在主要央行設立的目標之上。在經歷了一輪進取的加息週期後，美國聯邦儲備局自第三季起暫停加息，並表示政策利率可能已接近高位。這，以及美國經濟具韌性，使投資者情緒更加樂觀。然而，持續的地緣政治緊張局勢，例如俄烏戰爭以及當年中東地區衝突的爆發，為投資市場新增了波動和不明朗因素。在這個複雜且多變的投資環境中，滙兌基金的投資表現出現了一些起伏。儘管如此，滙兌基金仍成功取得了良好的投資回報。2023年，滙兌基金錄得2,260億港元的投資收益，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n儲備基金的主要目標，如《儲備基金條例》所制定，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。該基金可能用來維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以便協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局根據財政司司長的轉授權限，並在轉授的條件內，負責使用及投資管理儲備基金，向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 交換基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會已設立外匯基金的以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候均充分由極高流通性的美元計值資產支持；\n(iii) 確保足夠的流通性高可用於維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的；及\n(iv) 受(i)至(iii)限制，取得投資回報以協助保障Exchange Fund的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了Exchange Fund的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置中（圖1）。\n\n圖1 交易所基金組合劃分\n\n廣義而言，儲備基金擁有兩大投資組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有流通性高之美元資產，以提供全面支持予貨幣基礎，這是根據貨幣局制度的要求。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券及股權市場，以保障資產價值及長期購買力為目標。\n\n為更好地管理風險及提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局以審慎且循序漸進的方式，將發行基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這些包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私人股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私人股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別同時確定，依照審慎風險管理原則及投資組合多元化策略。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年建立，持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金帳戶購入，用作戰略目的。 鑒於其性質，戰略投資組合未納入評估中。\n\n# 在外匯基金的安排\n\n聯匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金和法定機構的存款。利率通常掛鈎於投資組合1的表現。一個例外情況是未來基金2，其利率根據投資組合和LTGP的回報，根據其投資組合比例約為35：65。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n香港儲備基金的投資過程支持於兩種資產配置的決定：戰略性資產配置和戰術性配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表基於香港儲備基金投資目標的長期配置。以戰略性配置為指引，資產會戰術性地配置以取得超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰術偏差」。雖然基準與循跡誤差3的限額是由財政司長與儲備基金管理委員會磋商後釐定，但戰術性決策及容許的戰術偏差範圍則由香港金融管理局在轉授權下設立。在容許的戰術偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可能管理頭寸以採取短期市場走勢的優勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的外匯基金投資辦公室專責管理外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室的職員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括整個BP及IP的一部分。內部管理的IP部分包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及不同衍生工具疊加投資組合，以實施宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n此外，香港金融管理局除內部管理資產外，亦僱用外部基金經理管理約29%的儲備基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部基金經理的目的是汲取市場上最佳的投資專門知識，以獲取可持續回報，同時亦汲取多元化且互補的投資方式，並善用外部市場見解及專門的投資知識。\n\n與使用外部經理相關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本以及扣繳及其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素決定，且可能每年有所不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境越見複雜，良好的風險管理日益重要。香港金融管理局設定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，適用於其內部及對外管理的投資組合，並確保妥善的風險監察及合規系統已制定。為推行有效風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已設有三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及操作風險）定期監察。風險管理過程規定了一個穩健的架構，支持香港金融管理局的戰略規劃及投資多元化努力。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局相信，對負責任投資和可持續的長期經濟表現的適當強調，可以協助取得外匯基金的投資目標，以及減低與其相關投資的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關事宜的風險。為積極支持負責任投資實務，香港金融管理局已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的投資流程，其指導性原則是，如果長期風險經調整的回報與其他投資相若，則通常給予ESG投資優先。有關香港金融管理局負責任投資工作的詳情，請參閱《可持續發展報告2023》的負責任投資章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2023年金融市場\n\n2023年的投資環境充滿動盪，並帶來諸多挑戰。\n\n2023年全球股市整體呈現向上趨勢。標準普爾500指數當年上升了24%，尤其在第四季，市場開始預期比預期更快減息。\n\n在債券市場，殖利率維持高位，10年期美國國債殖利率一度突破5%，達到自2007年以來的最高水準。然而，隨著市場對央行貨幣政策的預期改變，債券殖利率在年底回落，隨着債券價格的逐步增加。\n\n在貨幣市場中，美元對主要貨幣的表現不一。之中，英鎊和歐元對美元升值，而日圓和人民幣貶值。\n\n2023年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現體現在表1中。\n\n表1 2023年市場回報率\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n香港金融管理局錄得2023年投資收益2,260億港元。其中包括債券收益1,447億港元、股權收益581億港元（其中來自外國股權的收益為736億港元，而香港股權則錄得155億港元的虧損）、非港元資產的負面影響5億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬機構持有的其他投資收益237億港元。

To promote public understanding of its policies and operations, the HKMA communicates actively with the community and market participants through traditional and social media, the HKMA website, the Information Centre and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is striving to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline, and upgrade its digital capabilities in order to adapt to changes and ensure its policies and initiatives are effectively implemented.\n\n# Transparency\n\n# Media relations and use of social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2023, the HKMA held or participated in 188 open press events, comprising 11 press conferences, six media briefings, 15 stand-up interviews and 156 other public functions.

Topics included anti-scam initiatives, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\nMedia representatives were active participants in events organised by the HKMA in 2023, in particular the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit.

The HKMA’s major summit and conferences, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are livestreamed on its social media channels to enhance participation by the public and the industry. The HKMA also develops creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives. Recent content covered topics such as consumer protection and scam prevention, the Faster Payment System, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and major events of the HKMA.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for the public looking to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Public Enquiry Service handled 9,565 enquiries. About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins. Some of the common subjects of enquiries concerned banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received by the Public Enquiry Service since 2020, and Chart 2 provides a breakdown of the nature of enquiries received in 2023.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023\n\n# Publications\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published its Annual Report 2022 along with its first standalone Sustainability Report 2022. The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the BO.\n\nYoung visitors learn about the design of banknotes in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre\n\nGuided tour of the Information Centre for kindergarten students\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nSince 1998, the HKMA has been running a public education programme that reaches out to the community to raise public awareness of its work. To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the

企業功能\n\n企業職能以高透明度、效率及專業水平支持香港金管局的運作。為推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解，香港金管局積極透過傳統及社交媒體、香港金管局網站、資訊中心及其他渠道與社區及市場參加者溝通。\n\n在內部，香港金管局正努力建立一支靈活應變且專業的團隊，維持嚴謹的紀律，並提升其數字化能力，以便適應變化，確保其政策和措施能更有效地落實。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體的使用\n\n金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度，並推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。 2023 年，金管局舉辦或參與了 188 項開放新聞活動，包括 11 場新聞發佈會、六場簡報會、15 場即席訪談及 156 項其他公眾活動。 在該年期間，金管局亦安排了另外 25 則媒體訪談，發佈了 583 份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高本地、內地及外國媒體對香港金融管理局（HKMA）主要職能的意識，舉辦了新聞發佈會和媒體簡報會。內容包括防詐騙舉措、中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）和穩定幣。\n\n媒體代表積極參與香港金融管理局於2023年舉辦的活動，尤其包括第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會。為期三天的活動在本地、內地及國際媒體中產生了超過2,000篇正面、客觀的新聞報道。\n\n香港金融科技週2023，行政總裁致辭。\n\n先生 Eddie Yue, 首席執行官，於全球金融領導人峰會舉行媒體立聞會。\n\nArthur Yuen 先生（右側第一位），副行政長官，主持反詐騙消費者保護約章活動的分享環節。\n\n李先生（中央），副行政總裁，主持有關 e-HKD 試點計劃第一階段報告的媒體簡報會。\n\n陳達理先生（左起第一人），副總裁，主持財政市場峰會2023的委員會討論。\n\n創意社交媒體內容有助於上調公眾對香港金融管理局倡議及各種其他題目之意識。\n\n為更有效地與公眾互動，香港金融管理局運作六個社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、WeChat、X（前稱Twitter）及YouTube），這些平台統稱擁有超過150,000名追蹤者。香港金融管理局的主要峰會及會議，包括全球金融領導人投資峰會，均會透過社交媒體平台進行直播，以提升公眾及業界的參與度。香港金融管理局亦會開發具創意的社交媒體內容，以提升公眾對各種議題的意識。近期涵蓋的議題包括消費者保護及防詐騙、快速支付系統、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及香港金融管理局的重大活動。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n香港金融管理局的公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一個有效渠道，以更好地了解香港金融管理局的重要職能及運作。\n\n2023年，公眾查詢服務處理了9,565宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢與消費者銀行業務、銀行政策及規範、金融基礎設施及債務市場發展，以及紙幣和硬幣有關。一些常見的查詢主題包括銀行產品及服務、硬幣收藏計劃、零售債券發行計劃、銀行相關指引及通函，以及快速支付系統。\n\n圖1列明自2020年起公共查詢服務收到的查詢數字，圖2說明2023年查詢的性質。\n\n圖 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n圖2 2023年查詢性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n年度內，香港金融管理局發佈了其2022年度報告，連同首份獨立的可持續發展報告2022。2022年度報告在香港管理協會2023年度最佳年度報告頒發典禮的「非營利及慈善機構」類別中獲得金獎，為該類別的最高排名。與此同時，2022年可持續發展報告在香港會計師公會2023年度最佳企業管治及ESG獎項的「公營機構\/非營利機構（大型）」類別中獲得了ESG獎項。\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局發佈了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》及四期《季度通訊》，並定期更新《月度統計通訊》，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新分析。香港金融管理局亦發佈了十四篇inSight1文章，推出主要新政策及措施，並討論重要議題。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n香港金融管理局網站（www.hkma.gov.hk），包含近六萬頁以英文、傳統及簡體中文編寫的內容，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。網站包括根據《銀行條例》（BO）第20章維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及授權機構證券從業員登記冊，還有根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》維持的儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2018年起透過開放API，分階段在其網站上發布財務數據及重要資訊。截至2023年底，香港金融管理局已在網站上開立175組Open APIs，符合其目標時間表。\n\n香港金融管理局的開放API平台：\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n位於兩國際金融中心五十五樓的香港金融管理局資訊中心，設有展覽館及圖書館，旨在向社區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的意識。互動式展覽館展示香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展情況，連同研究香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務的資訊和展品。\n\n在這一年中，資訊中心接待超過31,000名訪客，並為學校及其他小組舉辦了超過480場導覽活動。\n\n圖書館，鄰近展覽館，專責收藏超過26,000本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，內容涵蓋香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行主題。亦維持人工智能及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及人工智能的證券人員登記冊，供公眾查閱，如銀行業條例第20章所規定。\n\n年輕遊客在香港資訊中心的導賞中學習紙幣的設計。\n\n為幼稚園學生設計的資訊中心導賞\n\n# 社區聯繫與公眾教育\n\n自1998年起，香港金融管理局一直推行一個公眾教育計劃，向社區推廣，以提升公眾對其工作的意識。截至目前為止，已有超過66,000人參與該公共教育計劃。2023年，為來自58間中學的逾1,200名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。研討會的題目包括香港金融管理局的工作概述、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字鎖匙的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融，以及銀行業的事業機會。\n\n香港金融管理局致力教育公眾，並鼓勵他們成為精明及負責任的金融消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙及信用卡詐欺的上升，香港金融管理局持續其努力，透過不同媒體提醒公眾保持警覺。以下《反詐騙消費者保護守則》推出後，亦推出了一項全新的意識宣傳活動，強調銀行及主要商戶承諾不會透過即時電子訊息要求個人及信用卡資料。香港金融管理局亦透過電台及社交媒體渠道傳達有關信用卡、個人貸款、網上購物、銀行服務及不同付款選項（包括“Buy Now, Pay Later”產品）的提示。\n\n一則新的短片和動畫，以「保障您的個人數位鎖匙；提防詐騙連結！」為主題，製作了食人植物和動物陷阱。\n\n跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾不要點擊可疑連結。\n\n動畫短片推動 e-laisees\n\n為支持環境，並汲取金融服務科技的推進，金管局鼓勵公眾成員在農曆新年期間透過社交媒體和電台宣傳，發放電子利是（e-laisees），並考慮使用良好如新的紙幣作為實體利是。\n\n香港金融管理局亦旨在提升公眾對金融業的了解，並提高年輕人對從事金融業事業的興趣，從而擴大香港金融業的人才儲備。鑑於其較早推出的短片一連串「中環人才四面睇」獲得正面反響，香港金融管理局推出新短片系列「金融特工隊：開拓新視野」，內容介紹金融業的4項成長範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。該短片系列利用電腦圖形及動畫，展示資深市場從業員監管年輕人才，協助他們處理日常工作的挑戰，並以輕鬆方式介紹業內的職業機會及前景。\n\n一連串短片《Financial

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

交易所基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立核數師報告 呈交 財政司司長\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核交易所基金及其附屬公司（「該集團」）載於第211至311頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及該集團於2023年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該集團當年結束的收入及支出賬戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註，包括重要的會計政策資訊。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公允地反映了基金及集團於2023年12月31日的財務地位，以及截至該年止的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」），根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7章行政長官發出的指示妥善擬備。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據財政司司長根據《發行基金條例》第7章所制定的指示，以及審計委員會的審計準則進行了我的審計。我在這些準則下的職責，進一步說明於我報告中「審計財務報表章節的審計師責任」一章。根據這些準則，我與集團保持獨立，並已根據這些準則履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，足以作為我發表意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指，在我對截至2023年12月31日止年度財務報表進行審計時，根據我的專業判斷，最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在審計財務報表處理的過程中，並在形成我的意見時予以考慮，我對這些事項並不提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金管局負責其他資訊。該等其他資訊包括香港金管局2023年年度報告中刊載於的所有資訊，除財務報表及我的審計報告外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未就該等資訊表達任何形式的結論。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式出現重大失實。基於我所做的工作，如果我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大失實，我必須報告該事實。我在此顧及事項，沒有任何需要報告的。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表須按照香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《發行基金條例》第7章行政長官發出的指示，作出真實而公允的呈述，並就貨幣管理局認為為編製財務報表免於重大錯誤（無論是因欺詐或錯誤引起）而必需的內部控制負責。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估小組的持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監察集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師負責審核財務報表。\n\n我的目標是取得合理的保證，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯報，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水準的保證，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計一定能發現重大錯報。錯報可能出現於舞弊或錯誤，如果個別或總體而言，它們可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所作出的經濟決定，則會被視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計的**部分**，我**維持**專業判斷，並**貫穿**整個審計過程保持專業懷疑態度。**亦**：\n\n識別並評估財務報表中重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能偵測出因詐欺所致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，較因錯誤所致的重大錯誤陳述的風險較高，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制；\n取得有關審計的內部控制的了解，以便設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但並非用以表達對集團內部控制有效性的目的；\n評估所使用的會計政策是否適當，以及其會計估計和相關披露是否合理；\n對集團使用持續經營基礎會計的適當性作出結論，並基於取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團繼續作為持續經營的**能力**產生重大疑慮的事件或情況的重大不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我有責任在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，或在披露不充分的情況下修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至我審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，**未來**的事件或情況可能導致集團無法**繼續**作為持續經營的實體；\n評估財務報表的**整體**呈現、結構和內容，**包括**披露情況，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現的方式反映其背後的交易和事件；以及\n取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊的足夠且適當的審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指導、監督和**執行**。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與聯匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組溝通，內容包括審計範圍及時間的計劃，以及重大審計發現，其中包含我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用的情況下，提供相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與財政儲備顧問委員會審計小組委員會所交流的事項，我確定在當前期間財務報表審計中最具重大性的問題，因此這些即為關鍵審計問題。我會在審計師報告中描述這些問題，除非法例或規則禁止就該問題進行公開披露，或在極為罕見的情況下，我確定某項問題不應在報告中進行通報，因為這樣做所產生的不利後果，合理預期會超過進行此類通報所帶來的公眾利益。\n\n林志源教授\n審計總監\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長轉授的權限，作為外匯基金（基金）管理人的身份，根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動是保護香港貨幣的匯兌價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產由4項投資組合管理：支持投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合和策略投資組合。支持投資組合的資產充分符合香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基地。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股權市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所及結算公司股份，該股份由香港政府為基金的策略目的取得。經營分部信息載於附註31。\n\n# 二 重大會計政策\n\n# 2.1% 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表是根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs為一統稱，包括所有適用的個別HKFRSs、香港會計準則及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的香港會計準則及解釋，以及在香港更廣泛層面被接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（合稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策如下所述。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新或修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次於本集團當前會計期間生效或可供初次應用。附註三規定了因這些發展在初步應用後對會計政策所產生的變更，但僅限於與本集團當前及以前會計期間相關的範圍，且反映於這些財務報表中。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司和合資企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要業務載於附註16和17。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非以下資產及負債是以公允價值計量：\n- 派生金融工具（附註 2.6）；\n- 以損益帳戶計量公允價值的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6）；\n- 以其他綜合收益計量公允價值的金融資產（附註 2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.10）；以及\n- 投資性不動產（附註 2.11）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入及支出報告的金額。這些估計及相關假設基於歷史經驗及不同其他因素，而這些因素在特定情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成了對資產及負債賬面價值判斷的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非能從其他資料來源顯而易見。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續檢討。會計估計的修訂，若僅影響該期間，則於該期間內確認；若影響當前及未來期間，則於修訂期間及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層在申請香港財務報告準則時所作出的判斷，對財務報表有重大影響，以及估計不確定性的主要資料來源，均載於附註2.18。\n\n若干比較數字已重新表述，以符合集團財務報表當年呈現方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團控制一實體，當其暴露於或擁有來自該實體變動回報的權利，並具備透過對該實體的控制權影響這些回報時，即視為控制該實體。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及第三方持有）。\n"}
