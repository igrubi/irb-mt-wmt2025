{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 內地機遇\n","en":"2022 was a year of confronting challenges head-on.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original phrase \"迎難而上\" is a Chinese idiom meaning \"to meet difficulties head-on\" or \"to face challenges bravely.\" The junior translations all use \"facing challenges head-on,\" which is accurate but slightly redundant (as \"facing\" already implies confrontation). The sixth translation, \"rising to challenges,\" is more concise but omits the proactive, determined nuance of \"迎難而上.\" \"Difficulties\" (in the sixth translation) is slightly more negative than \"challenges,\" which may not align with the original's neutral-to-positive tone. To balance fluency, cultural appropriateness, and precision, \"confronting challenges head-on\" better captures the idiom's assertive tone while maintaining natural English phrasing.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus spread widely, continuing to pressure global economic growth while inflationary pressures kept rising. Subsequently, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine further intensified inflationary pressures, prompting major central banks to adopt preemptive monetary tightening policies, amplifying volatility in global financial markets and increasing the risk of economic slowdown. Locally, the fifth wave of the pandemic hit Hong Kong, with a rapid surge in infection cases further damaging the economy. Meanwhile, negative media coverage surrounding quarantine measures and restrictions deepened misunderstandings about Hong Kong internationally, threatening its reputation as an international financial center. For the full year, Hong Kong's real gross domestic product contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) remains committed to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, implementing development-promoting measures across key strategic areas to further consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. Following three years of travel restrictions, we successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully resumed normal operations, enabling travelers to once again visit in person and experience the city firsthand. In November last year, the HKMA hosted the “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,” which drew financial leaders from around the world to attend in person. The overwhelmingly positive response to this event serves as the most compelling evidence of Hong Kong’s full recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainty. Nevertheless, the resumption of mainland economic activity will reinvigorate Hong Kong and the broader region. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to steadfastly fulfill its mandate of maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and banking system, while actively seeking opportunities to support Hong Kong’s development and enhance its competitiveness as an international financial center. We will also continue to contribute to global climate resilience and sustainable development. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will issue a separate 2022 Sustainability Report this year to provide a more detailed overview of the HKMA’s initiatives in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as the efforts made by the HKMA as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Monetary and Financial System: As Stable as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), implemented in 1983, has withstood multiple economic cycles and successfully resisted various external shocks. In 2022, the system's resilience was once again demonstrated. Amid the Federal Reserve's significant tightening of monetary policy, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner, in accordance with the established mechanism. Throughout this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money market continued to function smoothly, reflecting the stability and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe confidence in the linked exchange rate system stems from its solid foundation built over many years. As reiterated by the International Monetary Fund in its *2022 External Sector Report*, the credibility of the linked exchange rate system is based on multiple factors, including transparent operational rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, prudent fiscal policies, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to robust mechanisms, actively communicating with the public and the market to enhance their understanding of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LETS), conducting effective market surveillance, and preparing contingency plans for different scenarios all contribute to reinforcing confidence in the system across all sectors. Our social media campaigns promoting the operational mechanisms of the LETS have effectively maintained market confidence, even amid the frequent triggering of the weak-side exchange guarantee this year. Internally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also effectively utilized data analytics technology to strengthen market surveillance, enabling us to respond promptly to the latest market developments.\n\nThroughout the year, despite macro-level challenges and rising credit risks, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient, with ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2022, the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of local banks reached 20.1%, significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks slightly increased to 162.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenges in the credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system slightly deteriorated, with the specific classification loan ratio rising to 1.38% by the end of 2022. However, this level remained robust and was still below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: Effective Regulation Ensures Sound Operations\n\nThe pandemic has persisted for three years, intensifying challenges from various fronts, such as rising geopolitical tensions and the tightening of monetary policy by major central banks. However, thanks to prudent risk management and effective regulation over the years, Hong Kong's banking system has remained resilient and continues to play a vital role in supporting the economy.\n\nOne of the main regulatory challenges faced over the past year has been ensuring that banks continue to provide necessary support to customers while maintaining robust credit risk management amid ongoing economic uncertainties following the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \"pre-approved interest-only payment without principal repayment\" program has been further extended, with the addition of a voluntary partial principal repayment option, allowing borrowers to choose to begin repaying part of the principal, thereby helping customers prepare for resuming normal repayment schedules.\n\nIn response to heightened market volatility caused by major economies significantly tightening their monetary policies, another key regulatory initiative of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in 2022 was to strengthen oversight of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. We conducted in-depth assessments of the potential impacts of synchronized monetary policy tightening across major economies on banks, and introduced new scenarios for stress testing to evaluate banks' resilience to prolonged liquidity pressures.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to take forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across multiple areas. Regarding operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, we provide guidance to help banks establish comprehensive and robust operational frameworks to ensure stable operations, and offer detailed regulatory guidance tailored to specific operational areas, such as guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the growing adoption of cloud technology. Additionally, in light of the accelerated pace of digitalization, we have strengthened our efforts to combat phishing scams and promote consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA's call to provide basic banking services, with some establishing new branches and self-service banking facilities in large public housing estates in newly developed areas. Due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic, many Hong Kong residents have been unable to access their mainland bank accounts. In response, the HKMA has closely collaborated with relevant parties to reactivate approximately 500,000 mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to do so without needing to travel to the mainland in person.\n\nAnother key area of strategic importance for the continued development of the banking industry is enhancing professional capabilities. As the industry expands, the demand for skilled professionals remains substantial. Building on its talent development strategy — \"Connecting Talent with the Future\" — the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced several initiatives over the past year to help the banking sector attract, nurture, and retain talent. These measures focus on upskilling and reskilling existing employees, as well as cultivating the younger generation to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n#International Financial Center: Hong Kong Returns to the Global Stage!\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and phrasing. Key observations:  \n- **\"Long-standing\"** (used in translations 2, 3, 6) is more natural than \"implemented for a prolonged period\" (translation 1) or \"implemented for a long time\" (translation 4).  \n- **\"Concerted efforts\"** (translations 2, 6) and **\"multifaceted efforts\"** (translation 3) are better than \"extensive efforts\" (translation 1) or \"efforts in many areas\" (translation 5).  \n- **\"Typhoon Signal No. 8\"** (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is the standard phrasing, while \"No. 8 typhoon signal\" (translations 2, 4) is less precise.  \n- **\"Resounding success\"** (translation 1) and **\"highly successful\"** (translations 2, 3, 6) are effective, but **\"a resounding success\"** (translation 1) is more vivid.  \n- **\"Fully recovered\"** (translations 1, 5) and **\"fully resumed normal operations\"** (translation 3) are accurate, but **\"fully recovered\"** is more concise.  \n- **\"Ripple effect\"** (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is standard, but **\"positive ripple effects\"** (translation 1) is smoother than \"positive ripple effect\" (translations 2, 4, 6).  \n**Improvements**: Use \"long-standing\" for consistency, \"concerted efforts\" for precision, \"Typhoon Signal No. 8\" for accuracy, \"resounding success\" for impact, and \"fully recovered\" for conciseness. Ensure the summit's name is correctly rendered as \"International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" (not \"Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" in translation 4).  \n**Final Translation**:  \nThe long-standing pandemic-related travel restrictions were gradually lifted in 2022, and we made concerted efforts to bring Hong Kong back to the international stage. The \"International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\" held in November attracted over 200 international and regional executives from global financial institutions, drawing widespread attention and enthusiastic responses worldwide. Despite the summit coinciding with the first Typhoon Signal No. 8 issued in November in 50 years, it was a resounding success, conveying a strong message to the world that Hong Kong has fully recovered and is now demonstrating unprecedented vitality and energy. We are pleased to see the positive ripple effects generated by the summit, with many global financial institutions and international organizations currently hosting or planning to host various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors from around the world to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have realized the importance of face-to-face communication and engagement. Therefore, we have made every effort to personally represent Hong Kong at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and leverage overseas visits to meet with senior management of global financial institutions, deepening their understanding of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and the opportunities it offers under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center, we continue to explore new market frontiers in strategic priority areas such as fintech, opportunities in the Mainland, and green and sustainable finance. We are also further strengthening Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure to provide top-tier services and attract more enterprises to establish themselves in Hong Kong. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the \"2022 Sustainability Report.\"\n\n# Financial Technology\n\nFollowing the announcement of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress across all five areas in 2022.\n\nWe have achieved encouraging results in our efforts to comprehensively advance the digitalization of banking. According to the fintech application assessment, the Hong Kong banking industry has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, with the range of technology categories continuously expanding. Since 2017, our gradual promotion and support of digitalization have received active responses from banks and have consistently yielded positive outcomes. We will continue to closely collaborate with the industry, leveraging the assessment findings to further promote fintech applications in specific banking domains and to foster the development of individual technology categories.\n\nThis year, our work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has reached a significant new milestone. The \"mBridge\" project—a multilateral central bank digital currency cross-border network—has entered the pilot phase, becoming one of the first global CBDC initiatives to enable real settlement for cross-border corporate transactions. At the retail level, technical testing for cross-border use of digital RMB has entered its second phase, primarily testing the topping-up of digital RMB wallets through the Faster Payment System (FPS). Regarding digital Hong Kong dollars, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for the potential future issuance of a digital Hong Kong dollar, and launch the second-track pilot program, inviting industry stakeholders to thoroughly explore feasible application scenarios for digital Hong Kong dollars.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of fintech. The \"Commercial Data Pass,\" launched in October last year, represents a crucial step in enhancing Hong Kong’s data infrastructure. As a data-sharing infrastructure based on data owner authorization, the \"Commercial Data Pass\" enables financial institutions to access enterprise commercial data, making it easier for businesses—particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—to obtain financing. As of the end of 2022, the \"Commercial Data Pass\" had facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, totaling more than HK$1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also recognize the necessity to monitor and properly address the risks that may arise from such developments. We are closely monitoring the development of the virtual asset sector and participating in international discussions on related regulatory matters. After considering the opinions gathered from public consultations and relevant international standards, we will adopt the principle of \"same risk, same regulation\" to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins and define their regulatory scope. In the future, our regulatory focus will initially target stablecoins that claim to be pegged to the value of one or more fiat currencies, as these types of stablecoins may pose higher and more urgent potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that, under appropriate regulations, the industry will be able to more safely and securely explore the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector are actively preparing to embrace this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully unlock the potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\n#Opportunities in Mainland China\n"}

The labor market initially deteriorated but gradually improved thereafter, while inflation remained moderate. With the full resumption of cross-border travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from a low level in 2023.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2022, with capital and liquidity positions remaining ample and asset quality continuing to maintain a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAs the United States tightened its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar weakened, triggering the weak-side exchange guarantee multiple times during the year. However, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly and orderly, repeatedly demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system.  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but exhibit inconsistencies in terminology and phrasing. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Currency board system\" (Translation 1) and \"assurance scheme\" (Translation 6) are inaccurate; the correct term is \"linked exchange rate system.\"  \n2. **Verb Tense**: Present perfect (\"has weakened,\" \"have continued\") in some translations (e.g., 2, 6) misaligns with the original's past context (\"年內被多次觸發\").  \n3. **Redundancy**: \"The Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets\" (Translation 4) is unnecessarily wordy; \"Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets\" is more concise.  \n4. **Nuance**: \"Robustness\" (Translations 2, 3, 5) slightly overshadows the original's emphasis on \"穩健有效\" (stable and effective).  \nImprovements focus on precise terminology, consistent tense, and streamlined phrasing to reflect the original's formal yet clear tone.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. The Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of negative 4.5%, a relatively moderate loss compared to the performance of most diversified asset funds in the market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to actively promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since the commencement of investment in 2009.\n\n# BankingSystemStability\n\nIn response to expanding volatility in financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened its oversight of banks' credit and market risk management, working closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, in order to address the growing cyber threats and the accelerated digital transformation of the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA has further introduced consumer protection measures concerning \"buy now, pay later\" products and new property transfer payment arrangements. In addition, the HKMA has collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued guidelines on the distribution of investment products, and launched a new regulatory regime for trust business. The \"Credit Information Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Information Service Providers\" model for personal credit data was also activated this year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with banks to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CTF) ecosystem, strengthen measures to combat scams, and further promote the application of data and technology through its \"AML Compliance Technology Laboratory\" series, while accelerating the HKMA’s adoption of regulatory technology in AML work.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy requirements and disclosure standards, locally. The HKMA is also working with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance the skills of its workforce for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and created a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at all locally systemically important banks, marking a significant milestone in the development of the resolution mechanism.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in terminology, prepositions, and phrasing. Key considerations:  \n1. **Terminology Consistency:** \"Resolution mechanism\" is standard in regulatory contexts, though \"resolution regime\" or \"framework\" are also used. The original emphasizes \"mechanism,\" so this should be retained.  \n2. **Prepositions:** \"Established... at all locally systemically important banks\" (Translation 6) is more natural than \"in\" or \"for.\"  \n3. **Precision:** \"Locally systemically important banks\" (Translations 1, 2, 6) accurately reflects the original's \"具本地系統重要性銀行,\" whereas \"domestically\" (Translation 2) or omitting \"locally\" (Translation 3) risks ambiguity.  \n4. **Verb Choice:** \"Established\" (Translations 1, 6) is more precise than \"built\" (Translation 2) or \"formulated\" (Translation 3) in regulatory contexts.  \n5. **Nuance:** \"Marking a significant milestone\" (Translation 1) emphasizes impact better than \"important milestone\" (others).  \n6. **Fluency:** \"Loss-absorbing capacity resources\" (Translations 1–6) is redundant; \"loss-absorbing capacity\" alone suffices.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe final version integrates these insights, ensuring clarity, precision, and natural phrasing while adhering to regulatory terminology.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit was a success, consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center and generating a positive ripple effect.\n\nThe original text outlines three key initiatives: optimizing the PBOC-HKMA currency swap agreement, preparing \"Swap Connect,\" and developing the Debt Instrument Central Settlement System (DICS). The junior translations vary in accuracy and fluency. \n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** is fluent but uses \"dual-trading platform dealer mechanism,\" which is vague. \n- **Translation 2** incorrectly references the \"Central Money Markets Unit (CMU)\" instead of the Debt Instrument Central Settlement System (DICS). \n- **Translation 3** misidentifies \"Swap Connect\" as \"Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS),\" a critical error. \n- **Translation 4** is accurate but uses \"Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments,\" which is overly wordy. \n- **Translation 5** redundantly refers to \"Currency Swap Connect\" and uses \"dual-counterparty mechanism,\" which misrepresents the original's \"雙櫃台莊家機制\" (dual-trading platform market maker mechanism). \n- **Translation 6** contains a typo (\"dual柜台\") and incorrectly names the system as \"Central Movable Securities Settlement System.\"\n**Improvements:** \n- Use the official name \"Swap Connect\" without redundancy. \n- Accurately reference the Debt Instrument Central Settlement System (DICS). \n- Clarify \"dual-trading platform market maker mechanism\" to reflect the original's intent. \n- Ensure grammatical consistency (e.g., \"was optimized\" vs. \"has been optimized\"). \n**Best Translation:**  \nThe currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was optimized during the year, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also collaborated with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of \"Swap Connect\" and to introduce a dual-trading-platform market maker mechanism to support the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, efforts are underway to develop the Debt Instrument Central Settlement System into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia.\n\nGood progress has been made in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement its \"FinTech 2025\" strategy to promote the adoption of financial technology within the financial sector and enhance Hong Kong's status as a fintech hub. The Faster Payment System (FPS), known locally as \"轉數快,\" has experienced steady growth in usage as its features are enhanced.\n\n# Organizational Functions\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong (HKMA) maintains effective communication with the public and the market through various channels to enhance understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has diligently established a team emphasizing adaptability and sustainable development, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and enhancing its information technology capabilities to cope with changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\n"}

It emphasizes the novelty (\"first issuance\"), uses \"tender\" (standard in financial contexts), specifies the amount and term clearly, and places the program name logically. \"HK$\" is preferred over \"HKD\" for consistency with official currency notation. The structure avoids redundancy (e.g., \"Hong Kong dollar government bonds\" is sufficient without repeating \"Hong Kong dollar\" in \"HK$500 million\"). The phrase \"through a tender under the program\" ensures grammatical correctness and natural flow.\n\n# July 4th\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the optimization of their currency swap agreement, converting it into a standing arrangement that no longer requires renewal. The agreement's scale has been expanded from RMB 500 billion\/HKD 590 billion to RMB 800 billion\/HKD 940 billion.\n\n# July 13th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an updated commitment statement, reaffirming its commitment to adhere to the updated version of the Global Foreign Exchange Market Guidelines when acting as a market participant.\n\n# July 22nd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the optimization of RMB liquidity arrangements, including expanding the scale and simplifying procedures.\n\n# BankingSystem\n\n#January28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) have jointly issued a circular providing updated guidance for intermediaries engaged in virtual asset-related activities to protect clients.\n\n#January28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has updated its regulatory guidance on money laundering and terrorist financing risks related to banking management, virtual assets, and virtual asset service providers.\n\n# February 8th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced a six-month extension of the \"Banking Industry Talent Activation Program.\"\n\n# February 23\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Mortgage Insurance Limited (Mortgage Insurance Company), announced that the mortgage insurance scheme has been revised and expanded in its scope of application for completed residential properties.\n\n# February 23\n\nThe \"100% Guaranteed Personal Preferential Loan Program\" has introduced optimized measures (effective April 19, 2023) and extended the application period until the end of April 2023.\n\n# February 23\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in conjunction with the Banking Sector SME Loan Coordination Mechanism, has extended the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment\" scheme for an additional six months until the end of October.

Key issues include:  \n1. **Year Placement:** Most translations place \"2022\" either at the beginning or within the rule title. However, in legal English, the year typically follows the rule name (e.g., \"Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022\").  \n2. **Quotation Marks:** The Basel Committee’s title should be in quotation marks for clarity, as seen in translations 1, 3, and 6. Translation 5 omits them, reducing specificity.  \n3. **Verb Choice:** \"Enacted\" (translations 1, 5) is more precise than \"formulated\" (translations 3, 4) in legal contexts.  \n4. **Possessive Form:** \"Banks'\" (translations 1, 3, 5) correctly reflects the original’s possessive structure, unlike translation 6, which uses \"Bank\" (singular) and \"Fund Shares\" (less precise than \"Funds\").  \n5. **Fluency:** Translation 2’s structure (\"came into effect to implement\") is abrupt; smoother phrasing like \"have come into effect\" (translations 1, 3, 5) is preferable.  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, legal terminology, and natural English flow, as reflected in the final version above.\n\n#July 6–8\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) participated in designing and conducting a three-day regional crisis simulation exercise. The exercise involved 10 institutions from the Asia-Pacific region, including central banks, regulatory and resolution authorities, and deposit insurance institutions, aiming to strengthen cross-border cooperation.\n\n# July 8th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to authorized institutions on the sale of protection-type investment-linked life insurance to ensure customer protection.\n\n# July 8th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidance to banks and licensed holders of stored value payment tools based on the key findings and relevant implications outlined in the Government’s \"2022 Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report.\"\n\n# July 20\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority welcomes the Hong Kong Bankers' Association's announcement of an additional payment arrangement for residential property refinancing transactions, offering customers greater flexibility.

Key issues include:  \n1. **Company Name:** Most translations assume a specific insurer (e.g., \"Amex Insurance,\" \"Manulife\"), but the original text only specifies \"按證保險公司\" (likely \"Amex Insurance\" if \"按證\" is a transliteration). However, without explicit confirmation, using a generic term like \"the insurance company\" avoids over-speculation.  \n2. **Program Name:** \"Financing Guarantee Program\" vs. \"Scheme\" is acceptable, but \"Program\" aligns better with the original term \"計劃.\"  \n3. **Tense and Precision:** The phrase \"has also been extended accordingly\" (used in translations 2 and 6) accurately reflects the original's past-tense action and causal relationship (\"相應延長\").  \n4. **Terminology:** \"Deferral\" (used in translations 2, 3, 6) is more precise than \"delay\" in financial contexts.  \n5. **Clarity:** \"For a maximum total of 36 months\" (translation 3) avoids redundancy compared to \"for a maximum of 36 months in total.\"  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the original's nuances, using \"deferral\" and \"accordingly\" while maintaining a neutral company name.\n\n# September 26th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has finalized the implementation guidelines for the \"Fintech Professionals Training Subsidy Pilot Program\" and officially launched the program within the banking sector.\n\n# September 27th\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released the results of their second annual joint survey on the sale of non-exchange-traded investment products by licensed corporations and registered institutions.

{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","en":"# 2023 Work Priorities and Future Outlook\n\nDespite signs of economic recovery in early 2023, Hong Kong’s economy continues to face a challenging and uncertain external environment. Recent pressures on the banking sectors in the United States and Europe, including the collapse of several U.S. banks in March 2023, have created ripple effects across global financial markets. Furthermore, the tightening of monetary policy by major central banks could likely lead to a slowdown or even a recession in global economic growth in 2023. Meanwhile, ongoing geopolitical tensions and the persistent threat of deglobalization may continue to hinder global trade and cause periodic volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system, supported by its robust resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) places great emphasis on safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to promptly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. In the challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to prudently manage the Exchange Fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and ensuring high liquidity.\n\n# The financial system remains stable and sound.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will closely monitor the latest developments, remain vigilant, and guard against potential risks to maintain a stable and sound financial system. This is a prerequisite for the continued provision of essential financial services and, therefore, vital to sustaining the normal operation of Hong Kong's economy.\n\n# Stay vigilant about potential risks.\n\nIn 2023, uncertainty surrounding the future direction of U.S. interest rates, along with pressures emerging in the banking systems of advanced economies, may pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Furthermore, persistent geopolitical risks could continue to weigh on global trade and cause occasional volatility in global financial markets. However, Hong Kong's financial system, bolstered by resilience and buffers built up over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also possesses the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in both the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. The HKMA will also study matters that may affect the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintain the stability of the banking system\n\nGiven the escalating geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to curb inflation, the banking sector's operating environment in 2023 is expected to remain challenging. On the other hand, rapid technological advancements and digitalization present both opportunities and risks for the banking industry. In response to the rapidly evolving financial landscape, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to ensuring banks have sufficient resilience to withstand shocks through ongoing regulatory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimize its banking regulatory framework and policies by aligning with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions, focusing on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of borrowers with weaker financial conditions. The HKMA will also strengthen its supervisory system and take proactive measures to ensure that the overall credit risk level in the banking system remains under control.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to monitor the operating environment of businesses and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the eventual phasing out of the \"pre-approved interest-only\" scheme, while ensuring that customers facing temporary difficulties continue to receive appropriate credit support.\nThe original text emphasizes the HKMA's dual responsibilities: preparing for the scheme's exit and ensuring ongoing support for struggling customers. Key considerations include:  \n1. **Accuracy of terminology**: \"Pre-approved interest-only\" (not \"principal repayment holiday\" or \"interest-only repayment\") aligns with the original's \"還息不還本\" (interest-only).  \n2. **Institutional name**: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA) must be used consistently, not \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Services and Markets Commission.\"  \n3. **Nuance in phrasing**: \"Phasing out\" (vs. \"exit\" or \"withdrawal\") better reflects a gradual process. \"Facing temporary difficulties\" (vs. \"currently facing\" or \"temporarily encountering\") is more natural.  \n4. **Fluency**: \"Operating environment\" (vs. \"operational environment\") is standard in financial contexts. \"Maintain close communication\" is preferable to \"keep tight communication.\"  \n5. **Cultural appropriateness**: The translation avoids overly literal terms like \"principal and interest repayment suspension,\" which may confuse English-speaking readers unfamiliar with the original Chinese financial jargon.  \nThe best translation integrates these elements, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and natural English flow.\n\nIn addition, in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will strengthen its oversight of the liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions in 2023.\n\n# Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their business operations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to enhancing the operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities of the banking sector. Following the issuance of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" in May, the HKMA will maintain close communication with the industry to review the progress of authorized institutions in establishing operational resilience frameworks. At the same time, the HKMA will enhance the banking sector's cybersecurity capabilities by following up on issues identified in the \"Cybersecurity Assessment Framework 2.0\" and examining the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust triple data backup measures.\n\nAs the pace of digitalization accelerates, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s other regulatory priorities include strengthening oversight of banks’ risk management related to third-party service providers, as well as enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking sector.\n\n#Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will prioritize updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) ecosystem to address AML\/CTF risks, and further advancing the development of AML regulatory technology (RegTech) and compliance technology. The HKMA will revise its \"Guidelines on Countering Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing,\" issuing specific guidance on implementing risk-proportionate measures for \"politically exposed persons\" to facilitate the financial sector's effective and risk-based implementation of key legislative amendments. Concurrently, the HKMA will expand the scope of existing public-private partnerships to enhance information sharing and support the launch of an inter-bank information-sharing platform, aiming to expedite the detection of suspicious accounts, prevent account misuse, and strengthen protections for fraud victims while assisting them in recovering losses. The HKMA will also further promote the adoption of compliance technology (including data analytics) through the \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory\" and other AML compliance initiatives, striving to develop macro-prudential analytical capabilities to support its data-driven AML regulatory work. By implementing these measures, the HKMA will be better positioned to swiftly address systemic money laundering risks such as nominee account networks and flexibly respond to evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Services\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will intensify on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of authorized institutions regarding their conduct in wealth management, as well as the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), and other investment and insurance products in 2023. Key focus areas for 2023 will include the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. Throughout the process, the HKMA will take into account the latest market developments and revised international standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will also closely coordinate with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, providing guidance to authorized institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products as needed, including guidance on offering investment services related to virtual assets. To this end, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulators to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nWith the successful launch of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will coordinate with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to optimize the program. In addition, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales procedures for investment products (including those applicable to sophisticated investors), and will begin regulating the trust business of authorized institutions in accordance with the new units and operational guidelines in the relevant \"Regulatory Policy Manual.\"\n\n# Oversight of Financial Market Infrastructure\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aims to promote the safety and efficiency of financial market infrastructures under its supervision in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI), and the guidelines issued by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee. The HKMA will assess these infrastructures, as needed, by reference to the latest international standards. It will participate in the monitoring and evaluation programs conducted by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) regarding the implementation of the PFMI, and will also engage in the work of international standard-setting organizations. The HKMA will strengthen its supervisory requirements by aligning with international practices or adapting to market and technological developments. Additionally, where necessary, the HKMA will collaborate with relevant authorities to further enhance collaborative supervisory arrangements.\n\n# Policy Formulation\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to strengthen and optimize its banking regulatory framework and policies in line with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n#CapitalStandards\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further optimize its capital framework by implementing standards issued in recent years by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), including:  \n- The revised capital standards outlined in the December 2017 *Basel III: Finalizing Post-Crisis Reforms*, the January 2019 (revised in February 2019) *Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk*, and the July 2020 *Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework*. These revised capital standards, collectively referred to as the *Basel III Final Reforms*, establish new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, introduce output floor requirements, and refine the leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation on proposed amendments to the *Banking (Capital) Rules* (*Capital Rules*) in 2023 to implement these provisions and the countercyclical capital buffer. The proposed amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny in the same year and will not take effect before January 1, 2024, as a minimum requirement.  \n- The December 2022 *Prudential Treatment of Risks from Crypto-Assets*. The HKMA plans to implement these standards locally by January 1, 2025, in line with the BCBS timeline, and intends to consult the industry on related proposals in 2023.\n\n# Risk Tolerance\n\nIn March 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulted the industry on proposed amendments to the Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules. These amendments primarily responded to the HKMA’s implementation of revised capital standards under the final reforms of Basel III. The consultation document also included corresponding revisions to the treatment of concentration risk for official entities under the Capital Rules. The target implementation date for the revised rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk component under the revised Capital Rules related to Basel III’s final reforms (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standards\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules through the Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (the \"2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules\"). These amendments are made in response to concurrent proposed revisions to the Capital Rules, and therefore the target implementation date for the 2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk component in the revised Capital Rules under the final reforms of Basel III (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards in the final reform package of Basel III are primarily set out in the Basel Committee's \"Third Pillar Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework,\" issued in December 2018, and the \"Revised Market Risk Disclosure Requirements,\" issued in November 2021. In June 2019, the Basel Committee also issued the \"Revised Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements,\" revising the disclosure rules on the leverage ratio to address concerns about potential \"window dressing\" (i.e., banks reducing the volume of certain transactions before or after the reporting date in order to artificially increase the reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratio). To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also preparing corresponding amendments to the \"Banking (Disclosure) Rules\" (the \"Disclosure Rules\"), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and forms, and is seeking industry feedback throughout the process. It is expected that the amendments to the Disclosure Rules will be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny together with the amendments to the Capital Rules in 2023.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n- 建立了一套清晰且具備高問責性的機構管治架構；\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；及\n- 奉行具透明度及保持開放的政策，與各持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。尤其，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能」一章（第157至162頁）。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 監控措施\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的內部及外部監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和商討各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並由該會定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","en":"# Institutional Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong's central banking institution, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) fully understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in its fulfillment of statutory duties. Therefore, it has consistently strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo fulfill its commitment to sound institutional governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:  \n- Has established a clear and highly accountable governance framework;  \n- Has implemented robust monitoring measures to manage risks and ensure that the conduct and daily operations of all staff adhere to established standards; and  \n- Adopts transparent and open policies, maintaining close communication with all stakeholders.  \nThis translation integrates the strengths of the junior versions while addressing their weaknesses. It uses present perfect tense (\"Has established,\" \"Has implemented\") to reflect ongoing commitments, avoids redundancy (\"comprehensive and robust\" → \"robust\"), and maintains consistency in terminology (\"institutional governance\" over \"corporate governance\" for precision). The verbs \"adhere to\" and \"maintaining close communication\" balance formality with clarity, ensuring cultural and grammatical appropriateness.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR Government), but it may employ staff under terms of employment different from those of civil servants to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA's Chief Executive and its staff are all public officers. The HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations within the statutory powers conferred upon or delegated to the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that currency stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is autonomously responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including deciding on relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the Commissioner for Financial Management has the following responsibilities:  \n- Promoting the overall stability and effective functioning of the banking system;  \n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;  \n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender banknotes and coins;  \n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and operating such systems where appropriate; and  \n- Cooperating with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods used to implement government policy objectives, coupled with strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and supervising a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center and promoting economic development.\n\nThe original text emphasizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) need for public trust to fulfill its duties, its commitment to transparency, and its proactive use of media to counter misinformation. The junior translations vary in accuracy, fluency, and terminology. Key issues include:  \n- **Terminology**: Translation 2 incorrectly uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of \"HKMA.\"  \n- **Consistency**: Some translations mix \"responsibilities\" and \"duties\" (e.g., Translation 3 uses \"duties\" in the first sentence but \"responsibilities\" later).  \n- **Fluency**: Phrases like \"widely concerned by society\" (Translation 3) or \"with a rigorous attitude\" (Translation 6) feel awkward or redundant.  \n- **Precision**: \"Timely\" (Translations 1, 5) and \"as needed\" (Translation 2) lack the nuance of \"proactively\" (Translation 4), which better captures the HKMA's initiative.  \n- **Cultural Appropriateness**: \"Misinformation\" (Translation 4) is more precise than \"false information\" (others).  \nImprovements should standardize terminology (e.g., \"HKMA\" consistently), use precise adjectives like \"proactively,\" and ensure grammatical flow. The final translation should balance accuracy with natural English phrasing.  \nThe HKMA must earn public trust to effectively fulfill its duties. To this end, it rigorously explains its policies and operations to the public and proactively addresses issues of public concern within its mandate. In particular, the HKMA uses traditional and social media to clarify misinformation and rumors about its policies.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is appointed by the Financial Secretary and is therefore accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Furthermore, since the HKMA's powers are established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, it is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor matters of public concern. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive engagement with society, the HKMA is committed to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain openness. This policy has two main objectives:  \n- To the extent possible, ensuring that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA's work, while respecting statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data; and  \n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive communication with the media, it publishes a variety of bilingual journals and special publications. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections on economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a wealth of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an Information Centre, comprising a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week. Details on the HKMA’s efforts to communicate and engage with the public can be found in the chapter “Institutional Functions” (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively increased the frequency and detail of its disclosures regarding the Exchange Fund and the Currency Issuance Department. It joined the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) program for central banks in 1999. The HKMA also publishes meeting minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Issuance Department. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has provided access to banking sector supervisory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the Legislative Council’s Financial Affairs Committee on the HKMA’s operations and policies three times a year and answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives regularly attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s committees and subcommittees to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Monitoring Measures\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these monitoring mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees' ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that all employees at all levels comply with the specified standards.\n\n# Internal Monitoring\n\n# Operational Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for assessing risks in their work processes and establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the smooth and stable daily operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Title of HKMA Head:** \"Chief Executive\" (used in translations 1, 3, 6) is correct for the HKMA’s leader, while \"Governor\" (translations 2, 4, 5) is a misrendering of \"總裁\" (president\/CEO).  \n2. **Institutional vs. Possessive Form:** \"Institutional\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is more natural than \"institution’s\" (translations 3, 5), which incorrectly implies possession.  \n3. **Agency Name:** \"HKMA\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is the official acronym, while \"Monetary Authority\" (translations 2, 4) and \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" (translation 5) are either incomplete or incorrect.  \n4. **Fluency:** \"Conducted\" (translations 1, 3, 6) and \"carried out\" (translation 5) are both acceptable, but \"conducted\" aligns better with formal institutional contexts.  \nThe optimal translation combines accuracy in titles, proper institutional terminology, and natural phrasing.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, assesses whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Internal Audit Department independently assesses whether the governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments are adequate and effective, and provides recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External Audit\n\nUnder Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The Audit Commission does not charge any fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對第五波新冠病毒疫情、金融狀況收緊及充滿挑戰的外圍環境，香港經濟在2022年顯著收縮。勞工市場持續一段時間轉差，其後逐步改善，而通脹則維持溫和。資產市場亦有所受壓。受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預計2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受本地及外圍環境各項不利因素拖累，香港經濟在2022年收縮3.5%（表1及圖1）。本地方面，由於香港爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情，私人消費在第1季急跌，其後受惠於社交距離措施逐步放寬及政府消費券計劃的刺激，私人消費再度錄得按季增長。在營商氣氛疲弱及金融狀況收緊下，整體投資支出較2021年顯著下跌。對外方面，隨着外部需求轉弱，加上內地與香港之間的跨境陸路貨運受阻，香港貨物出口下挫。服務輸出依然大致疲弱，部分反映訪港旅遊活動低迷，但其後隨着政府於9月下旬撤銷抵港強制檢疫要求，情況於第4季稍為改善。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹\n\n本地通脹壓力於2022年稍升，但仍屬溫和。具體而言，按年基本通脹率逐步上升至12月2%的溫和水平，其中外圍能源及食品價格高企的影響部分被溫和的本地成本壓力所抵銷，尤其是偏軟的房屋租金（圖2）。此外，在經濟活動疲弱下，名義工資增長及商業樓宇租金持續偏軟，亦有助遏抑通脹。2022年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及1.9%。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n疫情下勞工市場狀況在2022年初急速惡化，但隨後持續改善。失業率在4月升至5.4%的高位後，於12月顯著回落至3.5%（圖3），當中大多數行業的失業率均有所下降。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺回升，反映整體勞工需求逐步回復，惟總就業人數仍低於疫情前水平。名義工資和勞工收入的按年升幅亦略為加快。另一方面，與去年同期比較，勞動人口於12月略為減少1.5%，部分原因是勞動人口參與率輕微下跌。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處及金管局職員估計數字\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市在2022年出現大幅波動。承接2021年的下行趨勢，恒生指數加速下跌，在2022年10月31日收報14,687點，是自2009年以來的最低水平（圖4）。股市顯著調整，最初是由市場對本地新冠病毒疫情、美國加息及俄烏局勢的憂慮加劇所觸發，其後由於環球金融狀況收緊及內地新冠病毒疫情導致環球經濟前景轉差，令股市調整幅度進一步擴大。股市在年內最後兩個月重拾一些上升動力，部分受到內地優化防疫抗疫措施所支持。恒生指數於年底收報19,781點，較2021年底顯著下跌15.5%，連續第三年下挫。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n在金融狀況收緊及經濟活動疲弱下，住宅物業市場亦有所受壓。樓價於2022年回落15%（圖4），成交量也大幅縮減39%至45,050宗，創下有紀錄以來的新低。儘管樓價下跌，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊。實際按揭利率於年內由約1.6厘上升至3.375至3.625厘，增加供樓人士的按揭供款負擔。非住宅物業市場亦進一步回軟。在空置率高企下，其價格有所回落，租金亦維持偏軟。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n受惠於內地與香港全面通關，預期2023年香港經濟增長將由低位復甦。儘管先進經濟體增長預期放緩將繼續拖累香港貨物出口，但內地經濟復甦及跨境陸路貨運限制撤銷，應能為本港經濟提供支持。內地與香港全面通關亦有望令香港入境旅遊及其他服務輸出顯著受惠，並提振本地營商氣氛及資本開支。私人消費亦將會在勞工市場轉強下進一步改善。政府預測2023年全年實質本地生產總值會顯著增長，介乎3.5至5.5%。然而，香港經濟增長前景仍受眾多風險及不明朗因素所影響，並很大程度上取決於美國聯邦儲備局政策利率走勢、全球增長前景、地緣政治局勢持續緊張以及本地入境旅遊的復甦步伐。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n展望未來，預期本地通脹將輕微上升，但在各種因素互相抵銷下應保持溫和。儘管外圍價格應會維持高企，但由於部分主要經濟體的經濟活動轉弱及商品價格上行壓力緩和，外圍價格的上升動力或會進一步減弱。同樣地，隨着本地經濟復甦及勞工市場改善，本地成本壓力或會輕微上升，但房屋租金偏軟應繼續在一定程度上抵銷其影響。政府預測2023年全年合計的整體及基本通脹率分別為2.9%及2.5%。另一方面，勞工市場狀況有望隨着本地經濟活動復常而進一步改善。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2022年面對充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，包括年初爆發第五波新冠病毒疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫，以及全球各大央行大幅度加息應對通脹上升等。面對各項挑戰，香港銀行應付裕如，資本及流動性狀況繼續保持充裕。年內銀行體系面對的信貸風險增加，但整體資產質素維持於健康水平。與此同時，利率上升促使銀行淨利息收入增加，但其正面影響因呆壞帳準備金增加及費用與佣金收入減少而被局部抵銷。整體而言，零售銀行盈利較2021年改善。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2021年底的0.89%上升至2022年底的1.38%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.56%升至0.85%（圖5）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為2.21%，亦較2021年底的0.89%上升。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是由於部分內地房地產發展商的貸款評級被下調。儘管如此，銀行撥備充足，截至2022年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約維持於80%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約140%。另一方面，2022年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.06%及0.23%（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的資產質素\n註：數字涵蓋香港辦事處、境外分行及境外主要附屬公司。\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n銀行體系在2022年繼續錄得盈利。年內零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利上升19.0%（圖7）。盈利改善是受惠於淨利息收入（+34%）及外匯與衍生工具收入增加（+72%），但部分升幅被呆壞帳準備金增加（+151%）及費用與佣金收入減少（–19%）所抵銷。在加息環境下，淨息差由上一年的0.98%擴闊至2022年的1.31%（圖8）。年內市場波動增加，亦令銀行來自外匯及衍生工具業務的收入增加。呆壞帳準備金增加是由於須為新的特定分類貸款預留特殊準備金，而在金融市場表現疲弱下，費用及佣金收入減少。零售銀行成本與收入比率由2021年的54.7%，降至2022年的48.0%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2022年銀行體系資產負債表擴大2.5%。資產上升是由於外匯及衍生工具持倉按市價計值增加。面對外圍不明朗因素及利率趨升，年內貸款需求減弱。相比2021年錄得3.8%的增幅，2022年貸款總額減少3.0%。其中在香港境外使用的貸款減少10.2%，貿易融資減少13.5%，在香港使用的貸款則稍增0.9%。中國內地相關貸款繼2021年增長3.7%後，於2022年減少4.4%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，銀行體系存款繼續錄得溫和增長。存款總額於2022年增加1.7%，相比2021年的增幅為4.6%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2021年底的71.8%稍降至2022年底的68.5%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行在2022年的資本狀況維持充裕。2022年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為20.1%，相比上一年為20.2%；一級資本比率為18.1%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2022年底為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖11 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖12 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況繼續維持穩健，成為在宏觀經濟環境不明朗因素加劇下的重要支柱。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2022年第4季為162.3%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為63.2%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2022年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為137.7%及155.7%（圖14）。以上所有4個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖14 指定認可機構的資金比率\n資料來源：金管局\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted significantly in 2022, facing the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, tightening financial conditions, and a challenging external environment. The labor market deteriorated for a period before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also experienced pressure. Benefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economy Activities\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, weighed down by various adverse factors both locally and externally (Table 1 and Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption plummeted in the first quarter due to the outbreak of Hong Kong’s fifth wave of the novel coronavirus. Subsequently, private consumption rebounded with quarterly growth, supported by the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the stimulus from the government’s consumption voucher scheme. Overall investment spending fell significantly compared to 2021 amid weakened business sentiment and tightening financial conditions. Externally, Hong Kong’s goods exports declined as external demand weakened and cross-border land freight between mainland China and Hong Kong was disrupted. Service exports remained largely weak, partly reflecting subdued inbound tourism, but improved somewhat in the fourth quarter following the government’s removal of mandatory quarantine requirements for arrivals in late September.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)  \nNote: Detailed quarterly changes in the seasonally adjusted local fixed capital formation total are not available.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\n#Inflation\n\nLocal inflationary pressures rose slightly in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the year-on-year core inflation rate gradually increased to a moderate level of 2% in December, with the impact of elevated global energy and food prices partially offset by moderate local cost pressures, particularly soft housing rents (Figure 2). Additionally, subdued economic activity contributed to restrained nominal wage growth and commercial property rents, which also helped contain inflation. For the full year of 2022, the core and overall inflation rates stood at 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in phrasing, redundancy, and flow. Key observations:  \n1. **Terminology Consistency**: \"Slight decline\" (used in translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is preferable to \"mild decline\" (translation 2) for consistency with \"slight acceleration.\"  \n2. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"total employment numbers\" (translations 3, 4, 6) are redundant; \"total employment\" suffices.  \n3. **Flow**: \"Rebounded\" (translations 1, 2, 5, 6) is more dynamic than \"rose\" or \"increased.\"  \n4. **Nuance**: \"Deteriorated rapidly\" (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is more precise than \"deteriorated sharply\" (translation 5) for describing the labor market's initial state.  \n5. **Clarity**: \"Year-on-year growth rates\" (translations 2, 3, 6) is clearer than \"annual growth rates\" (translations 1, 4, 5).  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe labor market deteriorated rapidly at the beginning of 2022 under the pandemic but subsequently improved continuously. The unemployment rate peaked at 5.4% in April before significantly declining to 3.5% by December (Figure 3), with unemployment rates decreasing across most industries. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies rebounded, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, although total employment remained below pre-pandemic levels. Year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and labor income also slightly accelerated. On the other hand, the labor force decreased by 1.5% in December compared to the same period last year, partly due to a slight decline in the labor force participation rate.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Government Statistics Department and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff estimates.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n#StockMarket\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant volatility in 2022. Building on the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on October 31, 2022—the lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The market's significant adjustment was initially triggered by heightened concerns over the local COVID-19 situation, U.S. interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Subsequently, the adjustment widened further due to tightening global financial conditions and deteriorating economic outlooks caused by the mainland's COVID-19 situation. The stock market regained some upward momentum in the final two months of the year, partly supported by mainland China's optimized pandemic prevention and control measures. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,781 points by year-end, marking a significant 15.5% decline compared to the end of 2021, representing a third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nUnder tightening financial conditions and weak economic activity, the residential property market has also come under pressure. Property prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), with transaction volumes dropping sharply by 39% to 45,050 units, reaching a record low. Despite the price decline, affordability remains tight. Actual mortgage rates rose from approximately 1.6% to between 3.375% and 3.625% during the year, increasing the mortgage repayment burden for homebuyers. The non-residential property market also softened further. With high vacancy rates, prices declined, and rents remained weak.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices. Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nBenefiting from the full resumption of cross-border travel between the mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from its low level in 2023. Although the slowdown in growth forecasts for advanced economies will continue to weigh on Hong Kong's goods exports, the recovery of the mainland economy and the removal of cross-border land freight restrictions should provide support for Hong Kong's economy. The full resumption of cross-border travel between the mainland and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit Hong Kong's inbound tourism and other service exports, boosting local business sentiment and capital expenditure. Private consumption is also expected to improve further as the labor market strengthens. The government forecasts that real local GDP for the entire year of 2023 will grow significantly, ranging between 3.5% and 5.5%. However, Hong Kong's economic growth outlook remains subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, largely depending on the trajectory of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy interest rates, global growth prospects, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the pace of recovery in local inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly but should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. Although external price pressures are likely to remain high, their upward momentum may further weaken due to slowing economic activity in some major economies and easing upward pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, as the local economy recovers and the labor market improves, local cost pressures may rise slightly, but soft housing rental prices are expected to continue offsetting their impact to some extent. The government forecasts overall and basic inflation rates for 2023 to be 2.9% and 2.5%, respectively. On the other hand, labor market conditions are expected to improve further as local economic activity normalizes.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of the year, escalating geopolitical tensions, and significant interest rate hikes by major global central banks in response to rising inflation. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong banks handled them effectively, maintaining ample capital and liquidity positions. While credit risk faced by the banking system increased during the year, the overall quality of assets remained at a healthy level. At the same time, rising interest rates boosted banks' net interest income, but this positive impact was partially offset by increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts as well as a decline in fee and commission income. Overall, retail banking profits improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology and phrasing. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology**: \"Specific classification loan ratio\" (used in most translations) is appropriate, though \"specific loan classification ratio\" (used in Translation 3) is less standard. \"Loan loss provision coverage ratio\" (Translation 1) is more precise than \"credit provision coverage ratio\" (used in others).\n2. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratio\" (Translation 4) redundantly include \"ratio\" twice. The correct phrasing should be \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loans.\"\n3. **Loan Status Terminology**: \"Overdue\" (used in most translations) is preferable to \"delinquent\" (Translation 5) in banking contexts, as \"delinquent\" may imply a broader default status.\n4. **Explanation Clarity**: The phrase \"i.e., the ratio of loan loss provisions to specific classification loans\" (Translation 1) is clearer than \"the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratio\" (Translation 4), which misplaces the term \"ratio.\"\n5. **Consistency**: Translations 1, 2, and 6 correctly use \"non-performing loans\" for \"呆壞帳餘額,\" while others use \"non-performing loan balance,\" which is slightly less precise.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe specific classification loan ratio of the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the overdue and restructured loan ratio increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). For related loans in mainland China, the specific classification loan ratio was 2.21% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by downgrades in loan ratings for some mainland real estate developers. Despite this, banks maintained adequate provisions. As of the end of 2022, the loan loss provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of loan loss provisions to specific classification loans) remained approximately 80%. If the liquidation value of collateral is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the coverage ratio rises to approximately 140%. Meanwhile, delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans at the end of 2022 remained low, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System  \nNote: The figures include the Hong Kong Office, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries.  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Rates of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nThe banking sector continued to record profits in 2022. Retail banks’ overall pre-tax operating profit rose by 19.0% during the year (Figure 7). The improvement in profitability was driven by higher net interest income (+34%) and increased revenue from foreign exchange and derivatives (+72%), although some of the growth was offset by rising loan loss provisions (+151%) and a decline in fees and commission income (–19%). In a rising interest rate environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility during the year also contributed to higher income from foreign exchange and derivatives businesses. The rise in loan loss provisions was due to the need to set aside special reserves for newly classified loans, while weaker financial market performance led to reduced fees and commission income. The cost-to-income ratio for retail banking fell from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banking  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Balance Sheet Trend\n\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 2.5% in 2022, driven by an increase in the mark-to-market valuation of foreign exchange and derivative holdings. Loan demand weakened throughout the year amid external uncertainties and rising interest rates. Total loans declined by 3.0% in 2022, compared to a 3.8% increase in 2021. Specifically, loans used outside Hong Kong fell by 10.2%, trade financing decreased by 13.5%, while loans used within Hong Kong rose slightly by 0.9%. Loans related to Mainland China, which had grown by 3.7% in 2021, declined by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the balance sheet, deposits in the banking system continued to grow moderately. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2021. Due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio declined slightly from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Ratio\n\nThe banking sector maintained ample capital adequacy in 2022. At the end of 2022, the consolidated total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both ratios were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio stood at 7.9% at the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 12: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Recognized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Liquidity Position\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system has remained robust, serving as an important pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Figure 13). Customer deposits continue to be the primary source of funding for the banking system. As of the end of 2022, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios were significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 14: Capital Adequacy Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n"}

Driven by increased trading activity in the local stock market and year-end seasonal funding demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong's interbank offered rate (HIBOR) generally followed the trend of its U.S. counterpart (LIBOR). Due to the United States' continued interest rate hikes, HIBOR rose steadily throughout 2022. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets remained stable, with transactions proceeding smoothly and in an orderly manner. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated a strong ability to withstand external shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, ensuring the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable within a band of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily employs a currency board system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base. If the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be correspondingly adjusted to fully match the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises:  \n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);  \n- Currency in circulation issued by the Government, including coins and banknotes;  \n- The aggregate balance of settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balances); and  \n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and a firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. When the strong (or weak) side of the exchange guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars at a rate of HK$7.75 per U.S. dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) total reserves, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the exchange rate band of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar weakened in early 2022, driven by adjustments in the local stock market, market expectations of further U.S. interest rate hikes, and carry trade activities fueled by the negative interest rate differential between Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). It remained close to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level throughout the subsequent months, with the guarantee being triggered 41 times between May and November. The Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November, supported by a resurgence in local stock market trading activity and seasonal year-end funding demand (Figure 1). Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Notes, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued an additional HKD 40 billion worth of Exchange Fund Notes in early 2022. In addition, between May and November 2022, the HKMA purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion at the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in response to banks' requests. The aggregate balance decreased from HKD 3,775 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 963 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Notes and the triggering of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee. Meanwhile, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Notes and bonds increased slightly during the year from HKD 11,488 billion to HKD 12,004 billion. As a result, the aggregate balance and the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Notes and bonds decreased from HKD 15,263 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 12,967 billion at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1: 2022 Market Exchange Rates\n\nFigure 2: Summary of Balances as of 2022 (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nUnder the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally follow the trend of U.S. dollar interbank offered rates (LIBOR). Due to the continued interest rate hikes by the United States in 2022, HIBOR gradually increased (Figure 3). For the year, the overnight, one-month, and three-month HIBOR rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, respectively, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% by year-end.\n\nIn response to the increase in the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range, the benchmark rate was raised seven times, totaling 4.25 percentage points (i.e., 425 basis points), rising from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, following the U.S. policy rate hikes, several banks increased their prime lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, another 25 basis points in early November, and a further 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the cap on newly approved mortgage rates based on the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 6.8 billion in 2021 to HKD 8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) in 2022\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating resilience in the face of challenges. Despite volatile global financial conditions in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets remained orderly, reflecting the system's robustness and effectiveness. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund repeatedly reaffirmed in its \"2022 External Sector Report\" that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate system. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience to shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, while maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the currency base. The support ratio (the ratio of supporting assets to the currency base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide a strong backing for the territory's monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of Support Ratio in 2022\n\n# Currency Issuance Committee\n\nThe Currency Board, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2022, the topics discussed by the Currency Board included the property market situation in mainland China, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. Meeting minutes of the Currency Board and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\n\n#Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to hold seminars to educate bank counter staff, retail cashiers, and students about the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes. In 2022, the HKMA conducted 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Program\n\nThe coin collection program continues to be popular with the public. Details of the program can be found in the chapter \"HKMA for Sustainable Development\" of the \"2022 Sustainable Development Report.\"\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Notes and taking into account market conditions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a total of HKD 400 billion in Exchange Fund Notes during the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the total outstanding amount. As of the end of 2022, the nominal value of outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds amounted to approximately HKD 12,075 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Monetary Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMFR) has completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and held 16 seminars\/webinars covering strategically important monetary and financial research topics relevant to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMFR has further arranged to release its research findings through a new open-access e-journal, ensuring broader accessibility to the information. In addition, the HKIMFR has launched a new series of publications titled \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest\" on its website, summarizing the Institute's recent research findings for the public in high-level, non-technical summaries.\n\nIn addition to research findings, the research center also hosted two international seminars and three online expert seminars, promoting dialogue and exchange on economic and financial matters:\n\nOn April 12, a webinar titled \"Latest Developments in Macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve's Tightening Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore Renminbi Market\" was jointly organized with the School of Finance. The event featured guest speakers Mr. Norman Chan, former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Professor Huang Yiping, Deputy Dean and Tan Choon Hong Professor of Economics at the National School of Development, Peking University. The webinar was live-streamed across multiple platforms, attracting 840,000 real-time online viewers.\n\nAn online webinar titled \"Transformation and Policy Choices in China's Real Estate Industry\" was held on June 24, featuring Dr. Qin Hong, a Senior Research Fellow at Renmin University of China and former Director of the Policy Research Center under the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as the keynote speaker. The event was moderated by Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economic Research and Chief China Economist at UBS. The webinar attracted nearly 1.13 million live online viewers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and other regions worldwide.\n\nOn August 25, the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements co-hosted an online workshop titled \"Monetary Policy Spillover Effects.\" Over 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial institutions, and academia worldwide attended the event.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies. Key issues include:  \n1. **Subject Pronouns:** Translations 2 and 6 use \"we\" or \"Co-hosted\" without a subject, which introduces an unwarranted first-person perspective absent in the original.  \n2. **Verb Choice:** \"Participated\" (Translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is slightly less precise than \"attended\" for formal events.  \n3. **Redundancy:** Phrases like \"around the world\" (Translations 1, 3, 4, 6) paired with \"worldwide\" are redundant; \"worldwide\" alone suffices.  \n4. **Title Nuance:** Variations like \"Spillovers of Monetary Policy\" (Translations 2, 4) vs. \"Monetary Policy Spillover Effects\" (Translations 1, 3, 5, 6) are both acceptable, but the latter aligns more closely with the original’s phrasing.  \n5. **Flow:** Translations 1 and 3 are concise but lack the active voice of Translation 4, which uses \"was attended\" (passive) versus \"attended\" (active).  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Remove first-person pronouns to maintain neutrality.  \n- Use \"attended\" for formality and clarity.  \n- Simplify \"around the world\" to \"worldwide.\"  \n- Retain the original title phrasing for consistency.  \n- Ensure active voice for smoother readability.  \n**Final Translation:**  \nOn August 25, the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements co-hosted an online workshop titled \"Monetary Policy Spillover Effects.\" Over 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial institutions, and academia worldwide attended the event.\n\nAs an additional event to the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit, an online seminar titled \"Post-COVID-19 Inflation: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" was co-hosted with the School of Finance on November 2. Dr. Quilin Huang, founder and chief economist of International Monetary Watch and former chief economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, provided analysis. Nearly 200 economists participated in the seminar online.  \nThe translations exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Key issues include inconsistent terminology for \"side event\" (e.g., \"external event,\" \"additional event outside the main program\"), imprecise organization names (e.g., \"Global Money Observer\" vs. \"International Monetary Watch\"), and speaker name transliterations (e.g., \"Quilin Li\" vs. \"Quilin Huang\"). The date format (\"November 2nd\" vs. \"November 2\") and the institution name (\"Financial Academy\" vs. \"School of Finance\") also require standardization. The most accurate translation should use \"side event,\" precise organization names, correct speaker details, and natural phrasing for the seminar title. The final version above integrates these improvements while maintaining clarity and conciseness.\n\nThe 12th Annual International Symposium on China's Economy was held on November 23, with the theme \"A New Phase in China's Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Vice Chairman and Director of the Academic Committee of the China Center for International Economic Exchange, delivered a keynote speech on the short-term and long-term prospects of China's economy at the symposium. Additionally, four chief economists from different investment banks in the Greater China region participated in a panel discussion, sharing their views on China's pandemic control policies, real estate market development, supply chain restructuring, and long-term growth prospects. The symposium attracted over 1.18 million online live viewers.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\n\nDespite a macroeconomic environment fraught with uncertainty and challenges, coupled with unprecedented volatility in financial markets, Hong Kong's banking system maintained robust resilience in 2022. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reinforced its regulatory oversight of credit and market risk management at authorized institutions. Furthermore, in response to the escalating cyber threats and the rapid digital transformation sweeping the banking sector, the HKMA collaborated closely with authorized institutions to bolster their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nIn terms of conduct regulation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has enhanced consumer protection for \"buy now, pay later\" products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property refinancing transactions. The HKMA has also collaborated with other regulatory authorities to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new trust business regulatory regime. This year, the \"Credit Information Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Information Service Providers\" model for personal credit data was launched, along with a new mandatory background verification program to address the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon. Additionally, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in implementing facilitation measures to enable customers to reactivate their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest risk assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborates with banks through public-private partnerships (including the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force) to strengthen Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing ecosystem, as well as enhance efforts to address fraud cases. Additionally, the HKMA partners with strategic allies to better understand and effectively manage risks and instabilities arising from an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA also promotes the industry’s adoption of data and technology through its “Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Tech Lab” series, while simultaneously accelerating the integration of regulatory technology (RegTech) into its anti-money laundering operations. In international affairs, the HKMA actively participates in the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nIn 2022, good progress was made in the local implementation of international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. Additionally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively enhanced the industry's soft power by collaborating with the banking sector to establish a sustainable talent pool and improve the skills of existing professionals. Throughout the year, the HKMA worked closely with the banking industry to refine and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe HKMA continues to advance its work at both local and international levels to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime. Specific initiatives include developing new resolution standards, conducting regional crisis simulation exercises, and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at all systemically important local banks, marking a milestone in enhancing resolvability.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in fluency and precision. Key strengths include accurate terminology (e.g., \"resolution mechanisms\/regime,\" \"loss-absorbing capacity\") and clarity in listing initiatives. Weaknesses include redundancy (\"strive to advance,\" \"dedicate itself to advancing\"), awkward phrasing (\"domestically systemically important banks\"), and inconsistent use of \"feasibility of resolution\" versus \"resolvability.\" The best elements are:  \n- **Clarity of HKMA's role** (e.g., \"advance its work\" vs. \"dedicate itself to advancing\").  \n- **Precise terminology** (\"resolution regime\" from Translation 3, \"resolvability\" from Translation 6).  \n- **Specificity in banking terms** (\"systemically important local banks\" from Translation 2\/4\/5).  \nImprovements focus on conciseness, avoiding redundancy, and using \"resolvability\" (a standard term in financial regulation) over \"feasibility of resolution.\" The phrase \"loss-absorbing capacity\" is more natural than \"loss-absorbing capacity resources.\" The final translation integrates these refinements for fluency and precision.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the essential financial services required by Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational practices, or even in extreme cases through disorderly collapses. As the regulatory authority, the Commissioner of Financial Services plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks have the capacity to withstand shocks and recover from crises to resume normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Commissioner is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted-license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution framework, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (as well as other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution framework, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and build the HKMA’s operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts approaches aligned with international standards.\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructure. The purpose of the Commissioner’s oversight is to enhance the overall safety and efficiency of such infrastructure, control systemic risks, and increase transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructure safeguards Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, preventing potential impacts on its stability caused by operational disruptions.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Licensing Matters\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority approved six overseas trading platforms to become currency brokers, while five licensed banks and one restricted-license bank had their recognition revoked.\n\nFor more information about accredited institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F on pages 283 to 286 and 292 to 295, respectively.\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 183 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of financial technology. To continue enhancing the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards, and conducted 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducts regular on-site inspections of the various business operations of authorized institutions. From a prudential regulatory perspective, credit risk management is one of the key areas of focus. At the same time, given the increasing use of technology by banks, operational and technology risk management have become another key regulatory focus. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA has also carried out a round of thematic reviews focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA conducts on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses, complemented by thematic assessments to examine areas identified as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 presents a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory activities in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe original text discusses loan volume changes in 2022 and 2021, referencing tables for detailed data. The junior translators' translations vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:\n1. **Numerical Accuracy**: The number \"45,220億港元\" (45,220 * 100 million = 4.522 trillion HKD) is critical. Translators 1, 3, 5, and 6 incorrectly rendered this as 452.2 billion HKD (4.522 * 10^11), while Translator 2 correctly used 4.522 trillion HKD. Translators 3 and 4 mistakenly wrote \"45,220 billion,\" which is 4.522 * 10^15, an order of magnitude error.\n2. **Geographical Reference**: The term \"內地\" (Mainland China) was misrendered by Translators 5 and 6 as \"Hong Kong,\" a critical error. Others correctly used \"Mainland China\" or \"related to the Mainland.\"\n3. **Fluency and Terminology**: \"Loan volume\" (Translator 4) is slightly more technical than \"total loan amount\" (Translators 1, 2, 6). \"Growth rates\" (Translator 3) is slightly less precise than \"growth\" (Translators 1, 2, 4, 6). \"Details\" (Translators 1, 4, 6) is more precise than \"shows\" (Translators 2, 5).\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe best version combines numerical accuracy, correct geographical reference, and natural phrasing. It should use \"4.522 trillion HKD\" for the number, specify \"Mainland China-related loans,\" and maintain fluent, precise language.  \n**Final Translation**:  \nThe total loan amount decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans and advances. Mainland China-related loans also decreased by 4.4% to HKD 4.522 trillion in 2022 (Table 3).\n\nThe banking system faced various challenges and shocks throughout the year, including the fifth wave of the pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, the aggressive pace of interest rate hikes by major central banks, and deteriorating financial conditions of some mainland real estate developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. The specific classified loan ratio in the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific classified loan ratio for mainland-related loans rose from 0.89% a year earlier to 2.21%.\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has broadened and deepened its risk monitoring, maintaining close communication with authorized institutions to promptly assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of these institutions. The overall credit risk facing the banking system remains manageable. The results of the HKMA’s stress tests on debt servicing capacity indicate that the banking system continues to maintain adequate capital buffers and is capable of withstanding extreme stress scenarios.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic review within the year to examine the credit risk management of authorized institutions, with a focus on asset quality, risk exposure to more vulnerable sectors, credit risk at branches outside Hong Kong, and secured loans provided to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nOn the other hand, in the challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of businesses are facing financial difficulties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) encourages authorized institutions to handle cases where businesses encounter repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles set out in the \"Code of Practice on Handling Corporate Financial Difficulties in Hong Kong,\" thereby enabling individual institutions to coordinate and cooperate from the common interests of the relevant lending institutions. \nThe best translation balances accuracy with natural English phrasing. It uses \"authorized institutions\" (standard financial terminology), retains the code's official title with quotation marks, and simplifies \"from the perspective of the common interests\" to \"from the common interests\" for conciseness. The structure avoids redundancy (\"coordinate and cooperate\" replaces \"cooperate in a coordinated manner\") while maintaining the original's emphasis on shared institutional interests.\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n\n# Alleviate customers' cash flow pressure\n\nConsidering the original text's focus on policy extension and support mechanisms, the junior translations exhibit commendable accuracy in conveying key details (e.g., HKMA involvement, pandemic impact, extension date). However, several areas require refinement:  \n1. **Terminology Consistency**: \"預先批核還息不還本\" is best rendered as \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" (used in translations 1, 2, 4, 5) rather than \"Principal Payment Holiday Scheme\" (translation 3) or \"Principal Repayment Deferral\" (translation 6), which may misrepresent the policy's intent.  \n2. **Mechanism Name**: The full name \"Banking Industry SME Loan Coordination Mechanism\" (translation 1) is more precise than \"SME Financing Coordination Mechanism\" (translation 3) or \"SME Loan Coordination Mechanism\" (translations 4–6), which omit \"Banking Industry\" for clarity.  \n3. **Temporal Precision**: \"Until the end of July 2023\" (translations 2, 4, 5) is preferable to \"July 31, 2023\" (translation 3) for formal policy documents.  \n4. **Verb Tense**: \"Has extended\" (translations 2, 4, 5, 6) aligns better with the present perfect tense for ongoing relevance than \"extended\" (translation 1).  \n5. **Cultural Nuance**: \"Prepare for resuming normal repayments\" (translations 1, 2, 4, 5) is more natural than \"return to normal repayment schedules\" (translation 6).  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nIn light of the impact of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with the continued complex and volatile outlook for external and local economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in conjunction with the Banking Industry SME Loan Coordination Mechanism, has extended the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme until the end of July 2023. Furthermore, the scheme has introduced and subsequently optimized certain principal repayment options to help customers prepare for resuming normal repayments.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, banks had approved over 108,000 cases of corporate client loan deferrals and other support measures, involving amounts exceeding HKD 1.1 trillion. For personal clients, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage interest-only payments (without principal repayment) and other personal emergency loans, involving amounts exceeding HKD 65 billion.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translations generally capture the core data but exhibit inconsistencies in tense, terminology, and numerical accuracy. Key issues include:  \n1. **Tense:** Most translations use \"had approved\" (past perfect), which aligns with the completed action by 2022. However, Translation 3 incorrectly uses \"have approved\" (present perfect), which implies ongoing relevance.  \n2. **Numerical Accuracy:** Translation 5 and 6 erroneously state \"HKD 110 billion\" instead of \"1.1 trillion\" for corporate loans, a critical error.  \n3. **Terminology:** \"Loan extensions\" (Translation 1) and \"loan deferrals\" (Translation 6) are both acceptable, but \"deferrals\" better reflects the temporary postponement implied in the original. \"Mortgage repayment deferral\" (Translation 1) is vague compared to \"interest-only payments (without principal repayment)\" (Translation 6), which precisely mirrors the original’s \"還息不還本.\"  \n4. **Redundancy:** \"Housing mortgage\" (Translation 2) and \"residential mortgage\" (Translation 3) are redundant, as \"mortgage\" inherently refers to housing.  \n5. **Cultural Appropriateness:** Using \"clients\" (Translations 1, 3, 6) is more formal and appropriate in banking contexts than \"customers\" (Translations 2, 4, 5).  \nThe improved translation corrects the numerical error, adopts precise terminology, ensures consistent tense, and avoids redundancy while maintaining clarity and formality.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have strengthened banks' risk management and enhanced the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for newly approved residential mortgages was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average debt-service-to-income ratio for new mortgages has remained at a low level, at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reduced the assumed increase in mortgage interest rates for property mortgage loan stress tests from 300 basis points to 200 basis points in September. This decision took into account the current interest rate environment, as well as the trend of mortgage rates relative to their historical long-term average. The HKMA believes this level is sufficient to ensure proper management of risks in the banking sector's mortgage business.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgages\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nOver the past year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced several measures to enhance the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures include the issuance in May of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the Regulatory Policy Manual, outlining the governance and control frameworks that authorized institutions are expected to maintain to ensure operational resilience. The HKMA also hosted two industry dialogues to enhance the industry's understanding of the new standards and facilitate the exchange of experiences within the sector (Figure 1).\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong (HKMA) provides detailed regulatory guidance on specific aspects of banking operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defenses against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nIn response to the ever-evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is striving to enhance the cyber defence capabilities of the banking sector by promoting the adoption of robust triple data backup arrangements, monitoring the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and assessing banks' ability to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to the significant increase in risks posed by phishing scams and other online frauds, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (HKBA) jointly launched a new large-scale promotional campaign in September with the theme \"Digital KEY, stay alert! Think twice before clicking the LINK!\" to raise public awareness. In July, they also co-hosted a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force to brief banks on the latest fraudulent tactics employed by criminals.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign themed \"Stay Alert: Digital KEY is Watching – Think Twice Before Clicking the LINK!\"  \nThis translation balances clarity, cultural nuance, and promotional tone. It retains the original's emphasis on vigilance (\"Stay Alert\"), personalizes the warning (\"Digital KEY is Watching\"), and uses \"Think Twice\" as a widely recognized idiom. Capitalizing \"KEY\" and \"LINK\" preserves the original's stylistic emphasis, while the structure ensures brevity and impact suitable for a poster.\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogue \"A Journey Toward Operational Stability\"\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn response to increased market volatility caused by further tightening of monetary policies by major economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened its monitoring of banks' exposure to market and liquidity risks. The HKMA is conducting reviews to assess whether authorized institutions have adequate liquidity risk management frameworks, with a focus on the diversification of funding sources and the systems and controls in place for managing group-wide liquidity risks. Additionally, the HKMA is carrying out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of authorized institutions' market risk management frameworks and controls over treasury operations.\n"}

While all translations capture the core meaning, several weaknesses exist:  \n1. **Structural Clarity:** Translations 1, 2, and 3 place \"2022\" awkwardly, disrupting natural English flow. Starting with the time phrase (\"In 2022\") improves readability.  \n2. **Terminology:** \"Position\" (translations 1, 3) is less precise than \"status\" (translations 4, 5, 6), which better reflects \"地位.\"  \n3. **Approach Description:** \"Multi-pronged approach\" (translations 3, 4, 6) is more idiomatic than \"multiple measures\" (translation 5) or \"multifaceted approach\" (translation 1).  \n4. **Verb Choice:** \"Achieving\" (translation 6) is passive; \"making\" (improved translation) is more direct and active.  \n5. **Consistency:** \"Financial centre\" (translation 3) uses British English spelling, while \"financial center\" (others) aligns with American English. The original uses \"中心,\" which is neutral, so \"financial center\" is acceptable.  \nThe improved translation integrates the most natural structure, precise terminology, and active voice to reflect the original's intent.\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit was successfully held, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions. This not only reinforced Hong Kong's position as an international financial center but also generated a positive ripple effect.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB hub, with advancements across multiple areas. These include optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements to ensure sufficient RMB liquidity and support the further development of offshore RMB products and markets. Jointly with the PBOC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the HKMA announced the launch of \"Swap Connect.\" In collaboration with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), a dual counterparty mechanism was introduced to promote the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, the HKMA launched a multi-year plan to further enhance financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments into a major international central securities depository platform in Asia. Benefiting from ample RMB liquidity and supported by world-class market infrastructure and various interconnectivity mechanisms between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for mainland capital entering international markets and for international investors to invest in the rapidly growing mainland market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also made good progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts targeting overseas and mainland stakeholders, helping them understand Hong Kong's robust financial system and the promising prospects it offers.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to implement its \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, promoting broader adoption of financial technology across the industry to further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a FinTech hub. The fast payment system \"FPS\" continues to grow steadily, with the number of registered users exceeding 10 million in March and the average daily transaction volume surpassing 1 million in September.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to actively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organizations, contributing to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial center. In November, the HKMA hosted the “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit” to implement the initiatives announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget. The three-day summit brought together leading figures from the global financial industry, who shared their unique insights on how to seize opportunities amid various uncertainties. The event received a very positive response, attracting over 200 high-profile guests from approximately 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrating the global financial community’s support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has further consolidated its position as the offshore RMB hub, with offshore RMB business showing steady growth this year. Hong Kong plays a key role in facilitating capital flows between the mainland and international financial markets. The interconnectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland are widely recognized as the preferred channels for international investors to access the onshore capital market and for mainland investors to allocate offshore assets. In 2022, the \"Northbound\" leg of the Bond Connect accounted for 61% of the total transaction volume of overseas investors in the China interbank bond market. Since their launch in 2021, the \"Southbound\" leg of the Bond Connect and the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect have operated smoothly. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of the \"Swap Connect,\" further expanding Hong Kong's financial cooperation with the mainland into the derivatives market and reinforcing Hong Kong's status as a major offshore RMB business hub and risk management center. In July, the existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBOC was optimized, marking another significant milestone in strengthening Hong Kong's role as the offshore RMB business hub.\n\nTo provide a more diverse range of RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in Hong Kong's stock market. The working group has commenced preparatory work, including the introduction of a dual-counter market maker mechanism to optimize the trading mechanisms for stocks denominated in both Hong Kong dollars and RMB.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) remains committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness as a preferred fund management center, the HKMA is working closely with the Government and the financial industry to create a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in the Hong Kong bond market, and in consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. At the same time, the HKMA has strengthened its market promotion efforts to introduce Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders both overseas and in Mainland China.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Facilitation Office continues to collaborate with banking sector departments to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy, promoting widespread adoption of financial technology within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a leading fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives launched this year include:  \n- Promoting the application of RegTech and conducting assessments of fintech applications;  \n- Advancing work on wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;  \n- Deepening research on the issuance of retail CBDC in Hong Kong (i.e., “Digital Hong Kong Dollar” or e-HKD);  \n- Launching the “Commercial Data Gateway”;  \n- Strengthening talent development;  \n- Leveraging funding schemes to support the fintech ecosystem;  \n- Enhancing cross-border fintech collaboration; and  \n- Promoting broader adoption of the fast payment system “FPS” (Fast Payment System).\n\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is crucial to maintaining Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository all achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Settlement services for Bond Connect’s Northbound and Southbound channels continued to operate smoothly. By year-end, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds held in the CMU system reached HK$1,207.5 billion, while the total outstanding amount of other bonds increased to HK$1,573.3 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe usage of FPS (Fast Payment System) continued to grow in 2022. By the end of 2022, there were a total of 11.48 million registered users, with the daily average transaction volume rising by 40% compared to 2021. In addition to steady growth in peer-to-peer and business payments, the increasing use of FPS to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up e-wallets or bank accounts for stored-value payment tools has been the primary driver behind the significant growth in FPS transaction volumes.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed stored value facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"). Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to assist the government in the smooth implementation of the Consumption Voucher Scheme by facilitating communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and the licensed stored value facility operators appointed for the scheme.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a summary in January 2023 of the feedback received on its discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, along with the HKMA’s responses. The summary confirms that the HKMA will adopt a risk-based and flexible approach to regulating stablecoins, detailing the anticipated scope of regulation, key regulatory requirements, and next steps.\n\nOn the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking matters and plays a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. Since 2018, the HKMA has been re-elected as Chair of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP) for three consecutive terms. In addition, the HKMA serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Subgroup under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), as well as co-chair of the Non-Bank Supervisory Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board (FSB). It also leads the subgroup under the FSB responsible for monitoring progress and follow-up on regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit was held from November 1 to 3.\n\nFollowing the Financial Secretary’s announcement in the 2022-23 Budget, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) hosted the “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit” in November. The three-day summit received a warm response, bringing together 26 industry leaders to share their unique insights and perspectives on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical instabilities, as well as seizing opportunities arising from these challenges. The summit attracted over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions, with more than 40 represented by their Group Chairmen or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Participating institutions included some of the world’s largest banks, securities firms, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit conveyed a clear message to the global community that Hong Kong has returned to normal. Global financial leaders can personally experience the city's unique resilience and vitality, and gain insight into the opportunities Hong Kong offers for expanding business in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong serves as a primary gateway into Mainland China and a global hub for offshore RMB business.\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as a global hub for offshore RMB business, including enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with mainland financial markets, and upgrading financial market infrastructure. RMB-related activities, encompassing bank deposits, trade settlements, payments, and offshore bond issuances, continued to register steady growth throughout the year. Encouraging progress and achievements have been made in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding interconnectivity mechanisms. The results of the Bank for International Settlements’ triennial survey on foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover in 2022 once again confirmed Hong Kong’s leading position as an RMB foreign exchange center.\n\nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in terminology, phrasing, and precision. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: Most translations use \"Northbound Trading\" or \"Northbound Trading Link,\" but the official term is \"Bond Connect's Northbound Trading.\" The sixth translation's \"Northbound Trading Link\" introduces redundancy. The second and fourth translations use \"Bond Connect 'Northbound'\" or \"Bond Connect (Northbound Trading),\" which are more accurate.\n2. **Investor Terminology**: \"Overseas investors\" (translations 2, 3, 6) is more precise than \"offshore investors\" (translations 1, 5), which can imply geographic proximity rather than nationality. \"Foreign investors\" (translation 4) is also acceptable but slightly less specific.\n3. **Financial Terminology**: \"Turnover\" (translations 1, 2, 4, 5) is standard in financial contexts, while \"trading volume\" (translations 3, 6) is slightly less precise. \"Turnover\" better reflects the value of transactions.\n4. **Market Description**: \"China interbank bond market\" should be hyphenated as \"China inter-bank bond market\" for clarity. \"Interbank\" is a compound adjective here.\n5. **Fluency and Redundancy**: Translation 6 uses \"Trading Link\" redundantly. Translation 5 repeats \"Northbound Trading\" unnecessarily. The fourth translation is concise and avoids redundancy.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nBond Connect's Northbound Trading remains the primary channel for international investors to access China's bond market through Hong Kong's market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the average daily turnover of Northbound Trading reached RMB 32.2 billion, a 25% increase compared to 2021, accounting for 61% of the total turnover by overseas investors in the China inter-bank bond market.  \nBond Connect's Northbound Trading remains the primary channel for international investors to access China's bond market through Hong Kong's market infrastructure and financial services.

Key observations:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Market-oriented optimizations\" (used in translations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) is slightly less idiomatic than \"market-driven improvements\" (translation 2) or \"market-oriented enhancements\" (translation 5). \"Digitization\" (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is more standard than \"electronifying\" (translation 4).  \n2. **Redundancy**: Repeating \"Bond Connect 'Northbound Trading'\" (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is unnecessary after the first mention; using \"the program\" or \"it\" improves flow.  \n3. **Clarity**: \"Onshore bonds\" (translation 2) is more precise than \"domestic bonds\" in financial contexts, but \"domestic\" is widely understood. \"Primary market issuance\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) is accurate, though \"primary issuance\" (translation 6) is more concise.  \n4. **Fluency**: Translation 4's \"electronifying\" feels informal; \"digitization\" is preferable. Translation 2's \"lower transaction costs for investors\" is smoother than \"reduce investors' transaction costs\" (translation 1).  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nBond Connect’s Northbound program introduced technical optimizations in July, including digitizing the process for investors to participate in domestic bond primary market issuances and reducing service fees. These market-oriented improvements have enhanced the program’s operational efficiency while lowering transaction costs for investors.  \nThis version avoids redundancy, uses precise terminology, and maintains a natural, professional tone.\n\nTo improve the translations, I focus on clarity, conciseness, and precision. While all versions capture the core message, several issues recur:  \n1. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"supporting arrangements,\" \"supporting infrastructure,\" or \"supporting mechanisms\" are repetitive. \"Enhancing the supporting mechanisms\" is more concise.  \n2. **Terminology**: \"Risk management center\" is less dynamic than \"risk management hub.\" \"Government bond futures\" is accurate for \"國債期貨,\" though \"sovereign bond futures\" is occasionally used.  \n3. **Flow**: Some translations use awkward phrasing, e.g., \"two-way interest rate swap market interconnection cooperation scheme\" (Translation 2) or \"mutual access cooperation\" (Translation 3), which can be streamlined to \"cross-border connectivity initiative\" or \"interconnected cooperation initiative.\"  \n4. **Consistency**: \"HKMA\" is used in some translations but not others; standardizing to \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" or \"HKMA\" (with a footnote if needed) improves clarity.  \n5. **Cultural Nuance**: The term \"北向通\" is consistently translated as \"Northbound Trading,\" which is accurate.  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nTo enhance the supporting mechanisms for Bond Connect’s Northbound Trading and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their investments in mainland China’s bond market, Hong Kong and mainland China announced in July the launch of a cross-border connectivity initiative for their interest rate swap markets (\"Swap Connect\"). Initially, Swap Connect will commence with Northbound trading, enabling international investors to trade mainland China’s interest rate swap products through connections between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a risk management hub. Preparations for Swap Connect are progressing in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching Northbound trading as soon as possible.

{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2022年）\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. This not only shattered the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could mitigate risk, but also marked the first time in nearly half a century that stocks, bonds, and major non-USD currency exchange rates all recorded negative returns in the same year. Under such adverse conditions, the Exchange Fund achieved a negative investment return of -4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses incurred by most multi-asset funds during the year, the Fund’s performance reflected the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s diversified long-term asset allocation, as well as its defensive measures and strategic adjustments in response to evolving external circumstances, effectively mitigating the impact of market turmoil.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary and the terms of the delegated authority.\n\n# Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:  \n(i) to preserve capital;  \n(ii) to ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;  \n(iii) to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained to support monetary and financial stability; and  \n(iv) to seek investment returns as far as possible, subject to compliance with the above (i) to (iii), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of OECD member economies, aiming to preserve asset value and maintain long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually allocated part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging markets and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, along with the allocation for other asset classes, is determined in accordance with prudent risk management principles and a strategy for portfolio diversification.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund's account. Due to the portfolio's unique nature, it is excluded from the Exchange Fund's investment performance evaluation.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Ownership Clarity:** Translations 3 and 4 incorrectly attribute share purchases to the \"Exchange Fund\" instead of the \"government,\" misrepresenting the original text.  \n2. **Proper Nouns:** Translations 1, 3, and 6 inconsistently capitalize \"Strategic Asset Portfolio\" or \"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited,\" which should be fully capitalized as proper nouns.  \n3. **Phrasing:** Phrases like \"under the Exchange Fund account\" (Translations 1, 2, 6) are awkward; \"under the Exchange Fund's account\" (Translation 2) is smoother.  \n4. **Redundancy:** Translation 4 redundantly states \"purchased by the Exchange Fund account for strategic purposes by the government,\" conflating entities.  \n5. **Terminology:** \"Investment performance evaluation\" (Translation 2) is more precise than \"assessment\" (Translation 5) or \"evaluation of investment returns\" (Translation 3).  \nThe best elements are combined in the final translation: proper capitalization, clear attribution of ownership to the government, and fluent phrasing that avoids redundancy while preserving the original's formal tone.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of its investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a notable exception. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is tied to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate determined by the allocation ratio between the two portfolios. In 2022, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected through investment benchmarks, representing the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. Guided by strategic allocation, the Exchange Fund seeks to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark through tactical asset allocation. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is termed \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, establishes the investment benchmarks and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office's staff directly manage approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. The internally managed portion of the portfolio includes diverse global fixed-income market investments, and the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies are implemented through derivatives.\n\n# Outsourced Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialized asset categories. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market to invest the Exchange Fund, achieve sustainable returns, and enable it to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\nThe translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate, but there are subtle differences in terminology that impact precision. \"Supervision\" and \"Oversight\" both relate to monitoring, but \"oversight\" carries a stronger connotation of formal accountability and regulatory scrutiny, which aligns more closely with the Chinese term \"監察\" (supervision\/inspection). While \"supervision\" is grammatically correct and widely understood, \"oversight\" better captures the nuanced implication of structured monitoring in professional or institutional contexts. The use of a hashtag (#) in all translations is appropriate, as it mirrors the original text's formatting. The most refined translation balances accuracy with contextual appropriateness by selecting \"oversight\" as the second term.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) risk management framework for investment portfolios. The junior translations generally capture the core content but exhibit inconsistencies in terminology, institutional names, and phrasing. Key issues include:\n1. **Institutional Name Accuracy**: Translations 1 and 3 incorrectly use \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" or \"Monetary Authority\" instead of \"HKMA,\" which is critical for institutional clarity.  \n2. **Terminology Consistency**: Variations in phrasing like \"three-line defense system\" (Translation 1), \"three-line-of-defense model\" (Translation 4), and \"three-line defense mechanism\" (Translation 6) reflect differing interpretations of the standard \"three-line defense\" framework.  \n3. **Pluralization**: Phrases like \"diversified investment\" (Translations 1, 3, 6) should be plural (\"diversified investments\") to match the original's grammatical structure.  \n4. **Fluency and Precision**: Some translations use \"solid framework\" (Translation 2) or \"robust structure\" (Translation 4), but \"robust framework\" better aligns with the original's emphasis on a \"sound\" or \"stable\" system.  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management is self-evident. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, along with rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA employs a three-line defense framework for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. It regularly monitors key investment risk categories—including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks—and the risk management framework provides a robust foundation for the strategic planning and diversified investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\n#ResponsibleInvestment\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, phrasing, and structural flow. Key observations include:\n1. **Terminology**: Most translations use \"HKMA\" or \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" consistently, but some incorrectly refer to the \"Exchange Fund\" instead of the full \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" (original: 外匯基金). The full name is more precise and aligns with official documentation.\n2. **Phrasing**: Variations in phrasing (e.g., \"responsible investment\" vs. \"responsible investing\") are acceptable, but \"responsible investment\" better matches the formal tone of the original. The phrase \"risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to those of other investment options\" can be streamlined to \"risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to other investment options\" for conciseness.\n3. **Structure**: Some translations split the sentence about ESG integration into two parts, reducing fluency. Maintaining a single, cohesive sentence improves readability.\n4. **Citations**: The report title should be \"2022 Sustainability Report\" (without quotes unless specified), and the chapter title \"Responsible Investment\" should be in quotes or italics to denote a section heading.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Foreign Exchange Fund and reduce environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related risks associated with investment activities. When ESG investments offer risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to other investment options, the HKMA generally prioritizes them in accordance with established guiding principles and has integrated ESG factors into the investment management processes of both the Foreign Exchange Fund’s public and private markets. Details regarding the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation can be found in the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# 2022 Financial Markets\n\nIn 2022, global financial markets experienced abnormal volatility, with bond markets and stock markets declining by 16.2% and 19.8% respectively, representing significant drops.  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but exhibit minor inconsistencies. Key issues include:  \n1. **\"Abnormal\" vs. \"Unusual\/Extreme\"**: While all translations use synonyms for \"異常波動\" (abnormal volatility), \"extreme\" (Translation 5) overstates the nuance, while \"unusual\" (Translation 3) is more neutral.  \n2. **\"Cumulative\" Misplacement**: Translations 2 and 3 incorrectly apply \"cumulative\" to the overall decline rather than specifying each market's individual decline (\"分別累計下跌\").  \n3. **Pluralization**: Translations 5 and 6 use singular \"drop\" instead of plural \"drops\" to match the two distinct markets.  \n4. **Verb Choice**: \"Marking\" (Translation 6) is less idiomatic than \"representing\" (Translations 1, 3) in this context.  \nThe optimal translation balances accuracy, fluency, and nuance by retaining \"abnormal volatility,\" clarifying the individual market declines with \"respectively,\" and using \"drops\" in plural to reflect the dual markets.\n\nWeighed down by soaring global inflation, tightening monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices experienced significant declines throughout the year. Although global markets saw a slight rebound at year-end amid expectations of inflation and interest rates reaching their peaks, the U.S. S&P 500 still fell by 19.4% for the year, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined by 15.5%.  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in fluency and precision. Key improvements include:  \n1. **Consistency in terminology**: \"Tightening monetary policies\" (plural) better reflects the original’s plural phrasing.  \n2. **Nuance in phrasing**: \"Reaching their peaks\" clarifies \"peaking\" as a noun, avoiding ambiguity.  \n3. **Fluency**: \"Amid expectations of\" flows more naturally than \"driven by\" or \"on hopes of.\"  \n4. **Cultural appropriateness**: Using \"U.S.\" and \"Hong Kong’s\" aligns with standard English conventions for geographic references.  \n5. **Verb choice**: \"Experienced significant declines\" balances formality and clarity, avoiding overly dramatic terms like \"plummeted.\"  \nThe final translation integrates these refinements for accuracy and natural English expression.  \nWeighed down by soaring global inflation, tightening monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock market indices experienced significant declines throughout the year. Although global markets saw a slight rebound at year-end amid expectations of inflation and interest rates reaching their peaks, the U.S. S&P 500 still fell by 19.4% for the year, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined by 15.5%.\n\nDue to central banks aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation, government bond yields in major markets have surged. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose from 1.63% in early 2022 to surpass 4% by the fourth quarter, reaching its highest level since 2008. The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted since mid-year, with the inversion widening continuously, deepening market concerns about an economic recession.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened in 2022, driven by the Federal Reserve's consecutive interest rate hikes. Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan, experienced sharp depreciation against the dollar, with the British pound and Japanese yen declining by 10.7% and 12.2%, respectively.\n\nTable 1 presents the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment losses of HKD 205.4 billion in 2022, including HKD 53.2 billion from bond investments, HKD 80.5 billion from equity investments (of which HKD 61 billion were from overseas equities and HKD 19.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a HKD 40 billion foreign exchange valuation adjustment for non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and HKD 31.7 billion from other investments held by the Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the Strategic Asset Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 8.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the total value of the Exchange Fund’s assets reached HK$4.008 trillion. The total market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$484.7 billion, of which private equity accounted for HK$370 billion and real estate for HK$114.7 billion. The total amount committed by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio but not yet drawn for investment was HK$270.8 billion.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) recorded an investment return of -4.5% in 2022, with the investment portfolio returning -8.6% and the supporting portfolio returning -0.4%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rates of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 displays the Exchange Fund’s investment return rates in 2022 and its average investment return rates for different periods.

Key observations:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Institutional functional departments\" (Translation 3\/5) is redundant; \"functional departments\" alone suffices. Translation 6 incorrectly references the \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" instead of the HKMA, a critical error.  \n2. **Fluency**: Phrases like \"maintaining high transparency... and demonstrating...\" (Translations 1–5) could be smoother with \"while\" (e.g., \"maintaining... while demonstrating...\").  \n3. **Precision**: \"Financial markets\" (Translation 3) is more specific than \"markets\" (Translations 1–2, 4–5), better aligning with the HKMA’s regulatory focus.  \n4. **Consistency**: \"The Authority\" (Translation 5) is acceptable but less precise than \"the HKMA\" for clarity.  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe functional departments of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority support its operations, maintaining high transparency and accountability while demonstrating exceptional efficiency and professionalism. To promote public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work, it maintains effective communication with the broader society and financial markets through traditional and social media, its website, information centers, and other channels.\n\nInternally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has diligently established a team emphasizing flexibility and sustainable development, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and enhancing information technology capabilities to cope with changes and ensure the effective implementation of various policies and measures.\nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Institutional Accuracy**: Three translations incorrectly use \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" or omit \"Hong Kong\" from \"Monetary Authority,\" which is critical for clarity.  \n2. **Verb Choice**: \"Diligently\" (Translation 1, 6) better conveys proactive effort than \"carefully\" (Translations 2, 4, 6).  \n3. **Terminology**: \"Flexibility\" (Translations 4, 5, 6) is more natural than \"adaptability\" (Translations 1, 2, 3) in this context.  \n4. **Redundancy**: \"Work team\" (Translations 1, 2, 3) is redundant; \"team\" suffices.  \n5. **Cultural Nuance**: \"Cope with changes\" (Translation 4) is more idiomatic than \"respond to changes\" (Translations 1, 2, 5, 6).  \n6. **Consistency**: \"Fiscal discipline\" (Translations 1, 3, 5) is preferable to \"financial discipline\" (Translations 2, 6) for institutional contexts.  \nThe improved translation integrates these refinements, ensuring institutional accuracy, natural phrasing, and precise terminology.\n\n# Maintain Transparency\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance transparency and foster public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2022, the HKMA hosted or participated in a total of 112 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 93 other public activities. Additionally, the HKMA arranged 46 media interviews. Throughout the year, 492 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large volume of media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) main functions, the HKMA holds press conferences and media briefings for local, mainland, and overseas media, covering topics such as the operations of the Hong Kong Note Issuing Office, green and sustainable finance, and central bank digital currency.\n\nVarious media actively participated in events organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in 2022, including the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.\" The three-day summit attracted significant media attention, with over 200 journalists from 87 media outlets attending to report on the event. This coverage resulted in approximately 1,000 news reports published in local, regional, and international media. Additionally, the event provided live streaming for 30 media outlets.\n\nTo effectively engage with the public, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) operates six social media accounts (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat, and YouTube), attracting over 100,000 followers. In 2022, the HKMA added a WeChat account to reach a broader audience. The HKMA utilizes social media to promote major events and initiatives, such as the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" and the Government Green Bond Programme, and to raise public awareness of various topics, including the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, and fraud prevention.\n\nMr. Yu Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, was interviewed by the media on-site at the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\".  \nThe original text requires precise handling of titles, names, and event terminology. Key issues in the junior translations include:  \n1. **Name accuracy**: \"余偉文\" should be \"Yu Wai-man\" (not \"Stephen Yü\" or \"Stephen Lewis\" or \"Yu Weimeng\").  \n2. **Title consistency**: \"金管局總裁\" is best rendered as \"Governor\" (standard for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority) rather than \"Chief Executive\" or \"CEO\".  \n3. **Event name**: The summit title is correctly translated but should retain quotation marks for consistency.  \n4. **Interview description**: \"即場訪問\" is best as \"interviewed on-site\" (not \"live\" or \"impromptu\", which add unwarranted nuance).  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, formality, and clarity while adhering to standard English conventions for such contexts.\n\nMr. Yu Weiwen, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered the opening keynote speech at the \"Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022.\"\n\nMr. Ruan Guohang, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech at the \"FinTech Elite Forum 2022,\" co-hosted by Cyberport and Accenture.\n\nThe original text requires precise translation of titles, names, and terminology. Key issues in the junior translations include:  \n1. **Name Accuracy**: \"李達志\" should be \"Li Da Zhi\" (not \"Li Tak-ji,\" \"Lee Tak-chee,\" or \"Li Dazhi\/Dakai\"), as \"達志\" is \"Da Zhi\" in standard pinyin.  \n2. **Title Consistency**: \"副總裁\" is \"Deputy Chief Executive,\" not \"Deputy Governor\" (used in some translations).  \n3. **Terminology**: \"數碼港元\" must be \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar,\" not \"digital yuan\" (a critical error in Translation 3).  \n4. **Verb Choice**: \"主持\" is best rendered as \"chaired\" or \"presided over\" (more formal than \"hosted\").  \n5. **Fluency**: \"Elaborate on\" is more precise than \"explain\" for \"闡述.\"  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nMr. Li Da Zhi, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired a press conference to elaborate on the HKMA’s policy stance regarding the \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar.\"  \n**Final Translation**:  \nMr. Li Da Zhi, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, chaired a press conference to elaborate on the HKMA’s policy stance regarding the \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar.\"\n\nMr. Chen Weimin, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a video address at the 2022 Financial Street Forum Annual Conference.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe Public Inquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's main functions and operations. In 2022, a total of 9,952 inquiries were handled, with approximately half relating to banking consumer matters, banking policies and regulations, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure, and bond market development. Among these, a significant number concerned the Coin Collection Scheme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and notices, as well as the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received annually since 2019, and Figure 2 shows the proportion of various types of inquiries in 2022.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2022, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA publishes two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Report, while regularly updating the Monthly Financial Statistics to provide the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong’s currency, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA has published 17 articles in the “Hong Kong Monetary Policy Insights” series (HKSIS), introducing its key initiatives and policies and discussing issues of public concern.  \nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in clarity and precision. Key improvements include:  \n1. **Clarifying \"Hui Si\"**: The sixth translation’s use of the full title and acronym (\"Hong Kong Monetary Policy Insights\" \/ HKSIS) is most informative, avoiding ambiguity.  \n2. **Consistency in terminology**: Using \"banking sector\" (as in translations 3 and 6) is more precise than \"banking affairs\" or \"banking industry.\"  \n3. **Avoiding redundancy**: Phrases like \"two issues of the Semi-Annual Report\" (translation 5) are preferable to \"two semi-annual reports\" for clarity.  \n4. **Nuance in \"專題\"**: \"Thematic\" (translation 4) better conveys the original’s \"專題資料\" than \"specialized\" or \"specialized data.\"  \n5. **Flow and conciseness**: Translation 6’s structure balances detail with brevity, while others occasionally repeat phrases (e.g., \"the HKMA publishes\" in translations 1–3).  \nThe final translation integrates these refinements, ensuring accuracy, clarity, and cultural appropriateness for an international audience.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2021 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category and the Excellence Award for \"Environmental, Social, and Governance Reporting\" at the Hong Kong Institute of Management's 2022 Best Annual Report Awards.\n\n# Institution Website\n\nThe institution's website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 46,000 pages of information in English, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest updates from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The website also hosts the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Stored Value Facility Operators,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nSince 2018, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been releasing financial data and important information hosted on its website through open application programming interfaces (open APIs) in phases. By the end of 2022, the HKMA had launched a total of 148 sets of open APIs on its website as per the original plan.\n\n#InformationCenter\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre 2 and serves as a key facility for introducing the HKMA’s work and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre comprises two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall uses interactive displays to showcase the HKMA’s work and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector, while also providing materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall is the library, which houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications covering topics such as Hong Kong’s currency, banking, finance, and central banking. In accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, the library also maintains the “Register of Local Representative Offices of Authorized Institutions” and the “Register of Securities Business Employees of Authorized Institutions,” which are available for public inspection.\n\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center progressively resumed public guided tours in the second half of 2022.\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center progressively resumed public guided tours in the second half of 2022.\n\nFollowing renovations, the newly refurbished library reopened to the public in March 2023.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\n\nTo maintain close contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA has been organizing public education seminars since 1998. In 2022, the HKMA held an online seminar that attracted over 2,200 students and teachers from 82 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's functions, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, safeguarding personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, and opportunities in the banking industry. To date, the public education seminars have attracted over 65,000 participants.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) educates and engages the public, reminding them how to be smart and responsible financial service consumers. In light of the rising number of phishing scams, the HKMA has launched a cross-media campaign to alert the public to be vigilant against fake links in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks, as well as other fraudulent tactics involving deposits and credit cards. The HKMA has also organized radio and social media campaigns to provide tips on the prudent use of credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods, including \"buy now, pay later\" products.\n\nA new short video titled \"Digital KEY is watching closely – think thrice before clicking the LINK!\"  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original title emphasizes vigilance (\"睇緊啲\") and caution (\"三思\") regarding digital security. While all translations capture the core message, several issues persist:  \n1. **\"Think twice\" vs. \"think thrice\":** The original uses \"三思\" (literally \"three thoughts\"), which is more precise than the idiomatic \"think twice.\" Translators 3, 5, and 6 use \"think twice,\" while 2 and 5 use \"think thrice.\" The latter better reflects the original's emphasis.  \n2. **\"Digital KEY\" vs. \"digital keys\":** The original uses \"KEY\" in uppercase, likely as a brand or system name, not plural. Translators 1, 3, and 6 use \"digital key(s)\" incorrectly.  \n3. **\"Watch closely\" vs. \"keep an eye on\":** \"睇緊啲\" implies active surveillance, so \"watching closely\" (translators 4, 5) is more accurate than \"keep an eye on\" (translator 1).  \n4. **\"LINK\" capitalization:** The original emphasizes \"LINK\" in uppercase, which should be preserved for consistency.  \n5. **\"Short film\" vs. \"short video\":** The original refers to a \"短片,\" which is a video, not a film. Translators 2 and 6 use \"short film,\" which is misleading.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe best version combines accuracy, fluency, and cultural appropriateness by retaining \"Digital KEY\" as a proper noun, using \"watching closely\" for vigilance, and \"think thrice\" for precision. The structure should mirror the original's balance between urgency and clarity.  \n**Final Translation:**  \nA new short video titled \"Digital KEY is watching closely – think thrice before clicking the LINK!\"\n\nTo help citizens stay abreast of the latest developments in financial technology services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is promoting the use of electronic red packets (e-hongbao) during the Lunar New Year through social media and radio broadcasts. The HKMA has produced an animated video explaining open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and outlining key considerations when using banking services via mobile applications from third-party service providers, such as online shopping platforms and mortgage service companies. The video also introduces the App-to-App and Web-to-App payment functions of the \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS), highlighting their convenience and efficiency.\n\nAnimated short films help enhance public understanding of digital finance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to deepening public understanding of the financial industry and fostering interest among the younger generation in joining the HKMA or the financial sector. In a newly produced interview video, graduates of the HKMA’s Trainee Manager Programme share their firsthand experiences, not only introducing the program to prospective applicants but also enhancing their understanding of the HKMA’s work.\n\nGraduates from the Management Trainee Program Share How to Prepare for Interviews.\n\nTo enhance secondary school students' financial literacy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is co-organizing the 8th consecutive edition of the \"Hong Kong Financial Literacy Challenge\" with various related organizations. This year’s theme focuses on green and sustainable finance, with students absorbing new knowledge through online quizzes (which saw record-breaking participation), webinars, and design thinking competitions.\n\nStudents present creative solutions incorporating green and sustainable elements in a design thinking competition to address the need for managing personal finances.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the \"Little Financial Managers\" online parent-child financial education program during the March special holiday and August summer vacation of the 2021-22 academic year. Through animated short videos, storytelling, crafting simple toys, and expert sessions with financial and early childhood education professionals, the initiative helped kindergarten and primary students grasp fundamental concepts of paper money and coins, banking services, payment systems, and basic financial knowledge.\n\nChildren learn financial concepts and skills through online learning.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) and other relevant reporting requirements (such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standards). The Financial Department prepares the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with HKFRS, with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. Furthermore, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of each expenditure item and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and Oversight\n\n# Risk Management\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks in the monetary and banking system is one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's most critical responsibilities. Risk management is not only embedded in strategic formulation but also operationalized across daily activities. The HKMA's risk management framework comprises two senior-level committees: the Macro-prudential Oversight Committee and the Risk Committee, both chaired by the Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  \nManaging risks in the monetary and banking system is one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's most critical responsibilities. Risk management is not only embedded in strategic formulation but also operationalized across daily activities. The HKMA's risk management framework comprises two senior-level committees: the Macro-prudential Oversight Committee and the Risk Committee, both chaired by the Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Macroprudential Oversight Committee's responsibilities are as follows:  \n- Identify potential risks and threats facing the Hong Kong monetary and financial system, and discuss feasible countermeasures;  \n- Review existing risk management measures for the monetary and financial system, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and  \n- Encourage cross-departmental sharing of macroprudential oversight information to enhance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's macroprudential oversight capabilities.\n\nThe Risk Committee’s scope of authority includes the following:  \n- Identifying potential risks and threats faced by the HKMA and developing strategies to mitigate their impact;  \n- Reviewing existing risk management systems across departments, identifying potential vulnerabilities and significant risks, and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to address them;  \n- Standardizing risk assessment criteria and methodologies, and prioritizing resource allocation based on identified risks; and  \n- Promoting and strengthening a risk management culture within the HKMA, fostering appropriate delegation of authority and oversight.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a robust operational risk management framework that covers organizational structure risks at both the institutional and departmental levels. Institutional-level risks refer to medium-term risks facing the entire organization or risks requiring cross-departmental collaboration. During implementation, each department is required to review and report on its potential and emerging risks, as well as the monitoring measures and mitigation strategies proposed, on a quarterly basis. This is supported by a top-down institutional risk management approach, enabling senior management in each department to identify major risks with broader impacts and recommend mitigation measures. These assessments are periodically reviewed and deliberated by the Risk Committee to determine appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division independently and objectively assesses whether the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) governance, risk management, and monitoring processes are adequate and effective. Functionally, it reports to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, while administratively it reports to the HKMA’s Chief Executive. The Internal Audit Division adopts a risk-based approach in conducting its operational and information system audits, covering all major risk areas. In 2022, the Division carried out 28 audits covering the HKMA’s reserve management, banking supervision, monetary and financial development, information technology, and other institutional functions. The audit results showed that the HKMA has sufficient and effective monitoring measures in place to manage the risks arising from its operations.\n"}

All versions correctly identify \"Independent Auditor\" and \"Financial Secretary,\" which are standard terms in Hong Kong's official documentation. However, the use of the hashtag (#) in translations 3 and 5 is unnecessary unless explicitly required by formatting guidelines, which are not indicated in the original text. The possessive form \"Auditor's\" (translations 1, 2, 4) is more natural in English for titles than \"Report of the Independent Auditor\" (translation 6), which feels overly formal and less idiomatic. The apostrophe placement in \"Auditor’s\" (translation 2) is a typographical variation but does not affect meaning. The best approach balances standard title conventions with clarity, avoiding superfluous symbols and maintaining natural phrasing.\n\n# Opinion\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), which are set out on pages 179 to 281. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2022, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI consider that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2022, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended. They have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but exhibit inconsistencies in formality, legal terminology, and completeness. Key issues include:  \n1. **Legal Terminology**: \"Bill\" (Translation 2) and \"Cap.\" (Translation 4) are incorrect; \"Ordinance (Chapter 66)\" is required.  \n2. **Entity Names**: Translation 5 incorrectly refers to \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" instead of \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n3. **Compliance Scope**: Translations 1, 3, and 6 omit the critical reference to Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  \n4. **Formality**: \"I believe\" (Translations 3–6) is less formal than \"I consider\" or \"I am of the opinion,\" which better matches the original's authoritative tone.  \n5. **Redundancy**: Translations 2 and 4 repeat \"in accordance with\" and \"in compliance with,\" which can be streamlined.  \nThe improved translation above integrates the required legal standards, corrects entity names, maintains formal phrasing, and ensures clarity and concision.\n\n# Basis of the Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Office. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\nThe original term \"關鍵審計事項\" is a standard heading in audit reports. The junior translations show varying approaches: some include a hashtag (#), others use all caps, and most omit it. The hashtag is unnecessary here, as it's not part of the original text and may imply informal or social media formatting. All caps (\"KEY AUDIT MATTERS\") is overly emphatic and unprofessional for formal documents. The most neutral and standard approach is title case (\"Key Audit Matters\") without additional formatting. This preserves the original's formality and aligns with English business document conventions.\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I addressed these matters in the course of my audit of, and in forming my opinion on, the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Fair Value Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value amounted to HKD 38,361.82 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 12,074.98 billion.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations by the first and second junior translators are the most accurate, correctly preserving the original numerical values (38,361.82 and 12,074.98 billion HKD) and using standard financial terminology (\"measured at fair value\"). However, the first translator’s use of \"carried at fair value\" is slightly less precise than \"measured at fair value,\" which is the preferred accounting term. The second translator’s use of \"totalled\" for financial liabilities is grammatically correct but less consistent with the verb \"amounted to\" used for assets. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth translations contain critical numerical errors (e.g., shifting decimal points or converting to millions), which distort the original meaning. The fourth translation’s use of \"millions\" is unconventional for such large figures, while the fifth and sixth translators incorrectly reduced the numbers by a factor of 100. The best translation balances accuracy, terminology, and numerical fidelity, ensuring clarity and adherence to financial reporting standards.\n\nThe fair value of 87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities is based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or is estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Parameters\" (used in translations 4 and 6) is less standard than \"inputs\" in financial reporting contexts.  \n2. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"the fair values of such financial assets\" (translation 2) or \"the fair value of all these financial liabilities\" (translation 6) introduce unnecessary repetition.  \n3. **Clarity**: Translation 3’s \"with the inputs used being based on\" is awkward; \"inputs based on\" is more direct.  \n4. **Parallelism**: Translation 5’s structure (\"either...or\") is concise but omits \"inputs\" after Level 1\/2, which could reduce clarity.  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, conciseness, and standard financial terminology, ensuring parallel structure and avoiding redundancy.\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 13% of these financial assets was estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). These financial assets totaled HKD 487.694 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the use of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:  \n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring controls;  \n- Evaluating and testing monitoring controls, including application controls related to computer systems;  \n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;  \n- Verifying prices against independent sources when market quotations are used;  \n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of related assumptions, and verifying parameters against independent sources when the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data; and  \n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method, as well as the reasonableness of related assumptions and parameters, when the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 18, and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 233.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds interests in four associate companies and 22 joint ventures, which are primarily engaged in holding overseas investment properties, with these interests valued at a total of HKD 396.31 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or through associate companies or joint ventures, are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:  \n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for all other information. This information includes all the content in the Financial Management Bureau's 2022 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of financial statements, I have the responsibility to review other information to assess whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with information obtained during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no such report.  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and fluency. Key improvements include:  \n1. **\"Review\" vs. \"Read\"**: \"Review\" better reflects the auditor's thorough examination of information.  \n2. **\"Materially inconsistent\"**: More standard in auditing terminology than \"significant contradictions\" or \"inconsistent with circumstances.\"  \n3. **Consistency in terminology**: Using \"other information\" uniformly (not \"documents\" or \"data\") aligns with professional standards.  \n4. **Final statement clarity**: \"I have no such report\" is more concise and natural than \"I have no report\" or \"I have nothing to report.\"  \n5. **Avoiding redundancy**: Streamlining phrases like \"based on the work I have performed\" to \"based on the work I have performed\" maintains clarity without repetition.  \nThe final translation integrates these refinements for accuracy, fluency, and adherence to professional auditing language.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing financial statements that are true and fair in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants, and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The officer must also implement internal controls deemed necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements arising from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Management Officer must assess the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclose matters related to the going concern where applicable, and apply the going concern basis of accounting.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translators' versions are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, structure, and fluency. Key observations:  \n1. **Title Accuracy:** \"Financial Management Officer\" (used in translations 2 and 5) aligns most closely with \"金融管理專員\" (Financial Management Officer), whereas \"financial manager\" (translation 1) or \"financial commissioner\" (translation 5) may misrepresent the role's specificity.  \n2. **Redundancy and Conciseness:** Phrases like \"continuing as a going concern\" (translation 4) or \"matters related to continuing as a going concern\" (translation 4) are redundant, as \"going concern\" already implies continuity.  \n3. **Prepositional Clarity:** \"Where applicable\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is more natural than \"in applicable cases\" (translation 2) or \"when applicable\" (translation 5).  \n4. **Verb Choice:** \"Assessing\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is preferable to \"must be responsible for assessing\" (translation 1) or \"must be responsible for\" (translation 2), which adds unnecessary formality.  \n5. **Accounting Terminology:** \"Going concern basis of accounting\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 6) is standard, but \"using the going concern basis of accounting\" (translation 4) is slightly less precise than \"apply the going concern basis of accounting.\"  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe final version consolidates clarity, precision, and conciseness by:  \n- Using \"Financial Management Officer\" for title accuracy.  \n- Removing redundancy in \"continuing as a going concern.\"  \n- Employing \"where applicable\" for natural phrasing.  \n- Using \"assess,\" \"disclose,\" and \"apply\" to streamline the three responsibilities.  \n- Maintaining the standard accounting terminology \"going concern basis of accounting.\"\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The Responsibilities of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any existing material misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if it is reasonably expected that they, individually or in aggregate, may have a material effect on the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:  \n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error;  \n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;  \n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer, as well as the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures;  \n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw users’ attention to the related disclosures in the auditor’s report. If those disclosures are inadequate, I must issue a non-unqualified audit report. My conclusion is based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;  \n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present transactions and events; and  \n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to form an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, along with any relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the six translations, several key issues emerge. First, terminology accuracy: \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" must be translated as \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" not \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" (third and sixth translations) or \"External Funds\" (fourth translation). Second, \"審核委員會\" is \"Audit Committee,\" not \"Review Committee\" (second translation). Third, the phrase \"有合理預期...負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益\" requires precise rendering of the conditional logic. While all translations capture the core meaning, the sixth translation best balances accuracy and fluency, though it could be refined for conciseness and clarity.\nThe best translation should: (1) use precise terminology, (2) maintain the original's conditional structure, and (3) ensure natural English flow. The sixth translation's structure is strong but slightly verbose in the final clause. The phrase \"because there is a reasonable expectation that communicating a matter... would result in adverse consequences that would outweigh the public interest, and I decide not to communicate that matter in the report\" could be streamlined to avoid redundancy.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nBased on discussions with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements and therefore constitute key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit disclosure, or in extremely rare circumstances where a reasonable expectation exists that communicating a matter in my report would result in adverse consequences outweighing the public interest, in which case I decide not to disclose it.\n\nAuditor General  \nProfessor Lin Zhiyuan\n\nAudit Commission  \nHong Kong  \n66 Des Voeux Road Central  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original text lists the name of an official body (\"審計署\") and its address in Hong Kong. The junior translators' attempts vary in accuracy and fluency.  \n**Strengths:**  \n- Translators 1, 6, and 3 correctly identified \"Audit Commission\" or \"Audit Office\" as the likely equivalent of \"審計署,\" though \"Audit Commission\" is more precise for Hong Kong's official body.  \n- Translators 1 and 6 correctly translated \"金鐘道\" as \"Des Voeux Road Central,\" the official English name of the road.  \n**Weaknesses:**  \n- **Translation 2** incorrectly used \"Gloucester Road, Wan Chai,\" a different location in Hong Kong.  \n- **Translation 3** used \"Queen's Road Central,\" another incorrect road name.  \n- **Translation 4** transliterated \"金鐘道\" as \"Jinzhong Road,\" which is non-standard; the official English name is \"Des Voeux Road.\"  \n- **Translation 5** used \"Office of the Auditor General,\" a term more common in jurisdictions like the UK, not Hong Kong.  \n- **Translation 6** omitted \"Central\" in the address, though it is often included for clarity.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Use \"Audit Commission\" as the official name in Hong Kong.  \n- Ensure the address uses the correct road name: \"Des Voeux Road Central.\"  \n- Maintain consistent formatting: organization name, city, and address.  \nThe final translation above combines accuracy, official terminology, and proper address formatting.\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}
