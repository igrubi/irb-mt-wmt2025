{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

Hong Kong's economy, already weakened by 2019 events, has contracted for the second consecutive year, marking the steepest decline in its GDP on record. Unemployment has reached a 16-year high, with certain industries bearing the brunt of the crisis.  \nThe translations generally capture the core message but vary in nuance and fluency. All correctly use \"GDP\" and \"COVID-19 pandemic\" from the dictionary. Strengths include natural phrasing like \"taking everyone by surprise\" (Translation 2) and \"particularly hard hit\" (Translation 5). Weaknesses include redundancy (\"nearly coming to a standstill\" in Translation 6) and overly formal phrasing (\"global community\" in Translation 5). The most fluent version balances clarity and concision, avoiding hyperbole while maintaining precision.  \nThe final translation integrates the best elements: a dynamic opening, precise economic terminology, and a natural flow that reflects the severity of the situation without excessive embellishment.\n\nHowever, adversity often reveals our true strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems have once again successfully withstood the shocks. This is no coincidence, but rather the result of our long-standing commitment to prudent policies.\n\nThe path to recovery is unlikely to be smooth. Even as central banks and governments worldwide fully support the economy, the outlook remains fraught with uncertainty, including the stance of central banks on monetary policy, the progress of vaccination programs, and the potential impact of prolonged low-interest-rate environments. On the other hand, constantly evolving geopolitical tensions add further uncertainty to the macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDespite facing such an uncertain situation, the HKMA will continue to fulfill its role, maintaining monetary and financial stability and creating a favorable environment for economic recovery. At the same time, in the constantly evolving banking and financial sector, we will also strive to seize opportunities and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Monetary and Financial Stability: As Stable as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) continued to operate smoothly and orderly in 2020. Since its implementation in 1983, LERS has weathered numerous challenges, fully demonstrating its ability to withstand shocks. Despite the pandemic and a volatile macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 85 times, with cumulative inflows of approximately HKD 383.5 billion.\n\nThe LERS has remained stable, relying on the solid foundation built over the years. As summarized by the International Monetary Fund in its \"External Sector Report 2020,\" the credibility of the LERS is built on high transparency in operational rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework. At the same time, the HKMA has swiftly dispelled rumors and provided the public with the latest facts and data through close engagement with the industry and effective communication via traditional and social media. The HKMA also leverages the latest technologies and data analysis techniques to continuously enhance its supervisory capabilities, enabling it to flexibly respond to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nAlthough the pandemic placed significant pressure on the economy, the banking sector remained sound with ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks reached 20.7%, far exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. The average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was also significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Affected by the pandemic, banks' asset quality slightly deteriorated, with the classified loan ratio rising to 0.9% by the end of 2020. However, it remained sound and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: the lifeblood of the economy.\n\nThe banking sector plays a crucial role as a financial intermediary in the economy and society. Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to focus on credit and liquidity risk management for banks, while also closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and implementing multiple measures to ensure the banking sector could continue providing essential services and lending support to the economy. In March, the HKMA reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April, it lowered the regulatory reserve requirement. These measures collectively released approximately HK$1 trillion in lending capacity for the banking sector.\n\nWe deeply understand that SMEs may face cash flow pressures under the current economic environment. Therefore, the HKMA, together with the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism established in 2019, introduced multiple relief measures, including the \"Pre-Approval Interest-Only Payment without Principal Repayment\" (PPPHS) scheme, which deferred the repayment of principal for all eligible enterprises by six months. By the end of 2020, banks had processed over 58,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures, involving a total value of over HKD 740 billion. In response to the resurging pandemic, the HKMA extended the PPPHS and prolonged the program until the end of October 2021 in March 2021. Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited also introduced the Special 100% Loan Guarantee under its SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to alleviate SMEs' burdens in paying employee salaries and rent. By the end of 2020, over 25,000 applications had been approved, involving approximately HKD 40 billion. The program was optimized in the first quarter of 2021, with the application deadline extended to December 31, 2021. Throughout the year, banks also processed over 28,000 relief measure applications for individual customers, assisting with cash flow needs involving HKD 44 billion. The banking sector's united efforts in supporting businesses and individual customers through these challenging times are truly encouraging.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to promote the banking sector to enhance financial inclusion and foster a customer-centric culture. We further encourage banks to pay particular attention to customers in need and to share good practices in various aspects, including providing banking services for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as offering more barrier-free and accessible banking services.\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, the operating environment of the banking sector has undergone swift transformation. Therefore, the HKMA's work is not limited to addressing current challenges but also involves looking ahead to expand the talent pool to align with the future development of the banking sector. We have jointly launched a research program titled \"Enhancing the Professional Development of Future Banking Talent\" with the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, aiming to assess potential talent gaps in the banking sector over the next few years and to develop clear roadmaps for banks to proactively address and improve the talent supply situation. We have also introduced the Banking Talent Programme, offering recent graduates from local universities a six-month internship opportunity and specific training related to the banking sector, thereby cultivating talent for the industry. Launching this program during a challenging period in the local labour market also provides opportunities for young people aspiring to join the banking sector.\n\n# Status as an International Financial Centre: Undeterred by Challenges\n\nTo fulfill one of the HKMA's key responsibilities, which is to help consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, our future planning covers the banking sector as well as the entire financial sector, aiming to ensure that Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial centre in an ever-evolving financial environment. During the pandemic, we have continued to steadily advance these initiatives and actively explored new opportunities in several key areas to fully capitalize on new trends and transformations.\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n**Review of Junior Translations:**  \n1. **First Translation:** \"Promoting green finance, creating a more sustainable future.\"  \n   - *Strengths:* Grammatically correct, fluent, and uses \"creating\" which aligns with the original's \"締造\" (create\/forge).  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"Promoting\" (gerund) feels slightly passive compared to the active imperative \"Promote.\"  \n2. **Second Translation:** \"Promote green finance, forging a more sustainable future.\"  \n   - *Strengths:* Uses \"Promote\" (active imperative) and \"forging\" (dynamic verb) to mirror \"締造.\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* The comma without a conjunction (\"and\") creates a slight grammatical awkwardness.  \n3. **Third Translation:** \"# Promote green finance, forging a more sustainable future\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* Unnecessary hashtag not present in the original text.  \n4. **Fourth Translation:** \"Promote green finance, and create a more sustainable future.\"  \n   - *Strengths:* Grammatically correct with \"and,\" which clarifies the relationship between clauses.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* \"Create\" is less dynamic than \"forge\" and feels slightly generic.  \n5. **Fifth Translation:** \"Promote Green Finance, Create a More Sustainable Future\"  \n   - *Weaknesses:* Capitalization of \"Green Finance\" and \"Create\" implies a title case, which may not align with the original's neutral tone.  \n6. **Sixth Translation:** \"Promote Green Finance and Create a More Sustainable Future\"  \n   - *Strengths:* Concise, grammatically sound, and uses \"and\" for clarity.  \n   - *Weaknesses:* Overcapitalization of \"Green Finance\" and \"Create\" may be stylistically inconsistent.  \n**Reasoning for Improvement:**  \nThe original text uses \"締造\" (forge\/create), which implies active, deliberate creation. \"Forging\" better captures this nuance than \"create.\" However, the comma without a conjunction in the second translation feels abrupt. The fourth translation's use of \"and\" improves flow but dilutes the dynamic tone. The best approach balances fluency, grammatical correctness, and fidelity to the original's intent.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nPromote green finance, forging a more sustainable future.  \n**Final Translation:**  \nPromote green finance, forging a more sustainable future.\n\nThe first area is promoting green and sustainable finance. Since the launch of the three-phase approach in May 2019, related work has made satisfactory progress. In 2020, we completed the \"greenness baseline\" assessment of 47 banks, published a white paper, and issued notices to provide guidance and share experience on managing climate risks in the banking sector. We are also fully advancing the second phase of work, establishing a regulatory framework for the banking sector to manage climate risks. Additionally, we will strive to require banks to disclose climate-related disclosures in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures by 2025 or earlier. This will make Hong Kong the first region in Asia to implement such specific requirements.\n\nAs one of the world's largest reserves managers, the HKMA actively incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the selection, appointment, and monitoring processes of external fund managers. We also practice what we preach by making ESG investments, including investments in green, social, and sustainability bonds as well as low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong's green finance ecosystem, the HKMA has consistently assisted the government in issuing green bonds, and the recently issued second batch of government green bonds has been particularly well-received by international investors. Riding on this development trend, the Financial Secretary announced in the \"2021-22 budget requests\" that the government will expand the scale of the \"Government Green Bond Programme,\" doubling the borrowing ceiling to HKD 200 billion, and will also increase the variety and issuance channels of future green bonds.\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, one of our key strategies is to collaborate with local regulatory bodies and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the HKMA, together with other regulators, has established the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group to coordinate relevant measures within the financial sector. The group has already developed a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, the HKMA, at the invitation of the International Finance Corporation, has become a founding member and the first regional anchor in Asia, working together with it to promote the \"Alliance for Green Commercial Banks.\" The alliance aims to promote green banking in global financial markets, starting in Asia and gradually expanding to other regions.\n\nWe expect the aforementioned work to help reduce the climate risks faced by the financial sector and promote Hong Kong banks to leverage their strengths in meeting the substantial funding demand for green investments in the region.\n\n# Fintech provides convenience for citizens and benefits the economy.\n\nAnother major driver of growth in the financial sector is Fintech, and the pace of development in this area has accelerated further during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe past year has clearly demonstrated that fintech can expand our \"toolkit\" to address sudden shocks. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic payment channels played an unprecedented role. From the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September 2018 to the end of 2020, FPS had recorded 6.9 million registered accounts. Even under the restrictions of social distancing measures, the public could still use FPS as a secure, fast, and reliable method for making payments and transferring funds, leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the average daily transaction volume of FPS in 2020. We have also been working with the government to expand the application scope of FPS to cover the payment of more types of government and public service bills.\n\nIn addition, fintech helps banks offer more diversified and convenient banking services to customers. All eight virtual banks licensed by the HKMA have already commenced operations in Hong Kong this year. As of the end of 2020, a total of 420,000 accounts had been opened with virtual banks, with aggregate customer deposits amounting to HKD 15 billion. Some virtual banks have already started using new types of data for credit assessments to target new customer segments and promote financial inclusion. The HKMA continues to promote the development of a larger and more diversified Regtech ecosystem in Hong Kong as part of the \"Banking Easy\" initiative, aiming to streamline regulatory requirements and enhance customer experience. In addition to publishing a series of communications to raise industry awareness of Regtech applications, the HKMA has also released a white paper outlining a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of Regtech in the banking sector. Furthermore, the HKMA has launched the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" project to enable SMEs to more conveniently access bank financing by leveraging their own digital footprints.\n\nThe HKMA must continue to uphold rigorous regulation as the fintech landscape evolves rapidly and technological applications become increasingly widespread. To this end, we have launched the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative 2.0 to enhance banks' cyber resilience. We have also strengthened on-site examinations of technology risk management and established a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of personal loan products utilizing innovative credit risk assessment techniques. The HKMA has initiated a three-year plan for the application of supervisory technology (Suptech) to improve the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of regulatory processes. Current initiatives include more effectively leveraging data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering oversight.\n"}

The labour market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. To address the severe economic environment, the government and the HKMA introduced relief measures to support the economy.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong's banking sector remains sound, with sound financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and Liquidity remain ample, and asset quality remains at a sound level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets operated smoothly and orderly, reflecting the continued stability of Hong Kong's monetary system. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered on multiple occasions. This fully demonstrates the robustness of the Linked Exchange Rate System and the confidence of the market in the system.\n\n# banking stability\n\nThe HKMA is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations while continuing to focus on the supervision of banks' credit and liquidity risk management. Given the ongoing increase in cyber risks and the industry's accelerated adoption of technology, the HKMA is strengthening its supervision of banks' technology risk management and operational resilience, as well as the protection of digital financial services consumers.\n\nThe HKMA has given banks flexibility to continue providing services to customers during the pandemic. The HKMA has also collaborated with other relevant authorities to formulate the implementation details of the Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme, as well as to provide guidance on family offices and wealth management services.\n\nIn combating AML\/CFT, the HKMA has swiftly taken action, not only clarifying how the risk-based approach and technology can help banks more effectively address situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA continues to promote information sharing through public-private partnerships and supports the banking sector’s adoption of regulatory technology.\n\nSeveral new rules and regulations will be introduced this year to strengthen the regulatory regime of the banking sector, aligning with the latest international standards. In the area of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second phase of a three-phase approach and is currently developing the relevant supervisory expectations. The HKMA is also committed to establishing resolution standards, conducting resolution planning, and building resolution execution capability to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with the banking and payment sectors increasingly adopting fintech. The transaction volume of the Faster Payment System has surged. The HKMA is actively participating in cross-border collaboration in areas such as CBDC.\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi business hub remains solid, and it continues to serve as the primary gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong’s financial ties with the mainland continue to strengthen through its world-class market infrastructure and interconnectivity mechanisms. Good progress has also been made this year in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nHKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform in areas such as asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a complex and volatile investment environment, THE EXCHANGE FUND recorded HK$235.8 billion in investment income in 2020, with an investment return of 5.3%, and all five major investment categories achieved positive returns.\n\nThe HKMA continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since the commencement of its investments in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions and Social Responsibility\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations. In performing its duties, the HKMA upholds high standards of corporate governance, supporting staff in enhancing their professional development, maintaining financial discipline, and strengthening IT capabilities and security to address new challenges and projects, as well as increasingly demanding workloads.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to commit to fulfilling corporate social responsibility, striving to become a responsible and sustainable organisation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA implemented special work arrangements to ensure the continued normal operation of key functions while safeguarding the health of its staff. The HKMA has also introduced various measures to support individuals and businesses in need, aiming to alleviate the adverse impacts of the pandemic.\n"}

The agreement’s scale has been expanded from the original 4,000 billion yuan (4,700 billion Hong Kong dollars) to 5,000 billion yuan (5,900 billion Hong Kong dollars).\n\n#bankingsector\n\n# February 21st\n\nThe HKMA and the Insurance Authority (IA) have introduced temporary facilitative measures in response to the pandemic, allowing non-face-to-face (non-F2F) distribution of specific insurance products, and are collaborating to review sandbox proposals involving authorized institutions (AIs) distributing insurance products through non-F2F methods.\n\n# March 16\n\nThe HKMA announced that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer applicable to Hong Kong has been reduced from 2.0% to 1.0%, effective immediately.\n\n# March 26\n\nThe HKMA, together with the Social Welfare Department and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), has introduced measures to enable social security recipients in mainland China to receive relevant assistance or subsidies through remote channels without needing to return to Hong Kong in person during the pandemic.\n\n# April 17th\n\nThe HKMA, together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the launch of the \"PPPHS\" scheme to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) customers.\n\n# April 20\n\nHKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) is now accepting applications for the \"Special 100% Loan Guarantee\" launched under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS).\n\n# April 24th\n\nThe Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2020 have been gazetted.\n\nThe HKMA has established a dedicated inquiry service in response to the pandemic to assist PPPHS plan customers.\n\n# May 7th\n\nHong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) has started accepting applications for its \"Fixed-rate Mortgage Pilot Scheme\".\n\n# May 8th\n\nThe original text is a formal statement about the HKMA issuing a consultation paper on a mandatory reference checking scheme to mitigate risks. The junior translators' translations are largely accurate but vary in tense, preposition choice, and verb form. Key considerations include:\n1. **Tense**: \"Issued\" (simple past) is appropriate for a completed action, while \"has issued\" (present perfect) implies ongoing relevance. The original text does not specify ongoing relevance, so \"issued\" is more precise.\n2. **Prepositions**: \"On implementing\" is more direct than \"on the implementation of,\" though both are grammatically correct.\n3. **Verb Choice**: \"Employing\" is more formal and standard in institutional contexts than \"hiring.\"\n4. **Clarity**: \"Authorized institutions\" is clearer than \"AIs\" or \"Als\" for general audiences, though abbreviations may be acceptable in specialized contexts.\nThe best translation balances accuracy, formality, and clarity. It should use \"issued,\" \"on implementing,\" \"authorized institutions,\" and \"record of misconduct.\"\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe HKMA issued a Consultation Paper on implementing the Mandatory Reference Checking Scheme to reduce the risk of authorized institutions employing individuals with a record of misconduct.\n\n# May 22\n\nThe HKMA has released a comprehensive Report on Review of Self-assessments on Bank Culture, providing the industry with a series of practices for reference.\n\n# May 29\n\nHKMCI announced optimization measures for the \"80% and 90% Guarantee Products\" under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS), which take effect immediately.\n\n# June 4th\n\nHKMA announced the launch of the Banking Talent Programme in collaboration with the banking sector, providing short-term job opportunities and professional training for recent university graduates during the pandemic.\n\n# June 30th\n\nThe HKMA has published a white paper on green and sustainable banking, outlining its preliminary thoughts on the regulatory approach to climate-related issues.\n\n# July 10th\n\nThe HKMA is consulting the industry on proposals to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\n\n# July 31\n\nThe HKMA provides guidance to banks on simplified arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\n\n# August 5th\n\nThe HKMA, together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism, announced the extension of the 90-day repayment deferment for trade facilities under the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme.\n\nThe original text requires precise translation of specific terms and adherence to formal regulatory language. All junior translations correctly use the dictionary terms (HKMA, IA, insurance products, supervisory expectations, video conferencing tools). However, variations in tense, prepositions, and phrasing affect fluency and accuracy. \n**Key observations:**\n1. **Tense:** The original does not specify a time frame, so present continuous (\"are collaborating\") is more appropriate than past perfect (\"have collaborated\") used in Translation 6.\n2. **Specificity:** \"Long-term insurance products\" must be included (as in Translations 1, 3, 5, 6), as the original explicitly mentions \"長期保險產品.\"\n3. **Prepositions:** \"Regarding the use of\" (Translations 1, 5, 6) is more precise than \"for the sale of\" (Translations 1, 4) or \"to sell\" (Translations 2, 3).\n4. **Conciseness:** Translation 4 is concise but omits \"long-term,\" while Translation 5 balances clarity and formality.\n**Improved translation:**  \nThe HKMA and IA are collaborating to provide guidance to the industry on supervisory expectations regarding the use of video conferencing tools to sell long-term insurance products.  \nThis version maintains present continuous tense, includes \"long-term,\" uses \"regarding the use of,\" and aligns with formal regulatory phrasing.\n\n# August 20th\n\nThe HKMA has relaxed countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage loans on non-residential properties, increasing the applicable loan-to-value ratio caps.

Key considerations:  \n1. **\"Batch\" vs. \"Tranche\":** \"Tranche\" is more precise in financial contexts, as it denotes a specific portion of a larger issuance, aligning with the technicality of bond markets.  \n2. **Tense Selection:** The original text uses the neutral verb \"發行\" (issue), which can be rendered in present tense (\"is issued\") for general statements or present perfect (\"has been issued\") for completed actions. However, present tense is more natural for formal announcements unless a specific time is emphasized.  \n3. **Structure:** Starting with \"The seventh...\" (as in translations 1–3, 5) is clearer than the gerund form (\"Issuing...\") used in translations 4 and 6, which feels more like a headline than a full sentence.  \n4. **Dictionary Compliance:** All translations correctly use \"Government Bond Programme,\" \"inflation-linked,\" and \"iBond\" as required.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Replace \"batch\" with \"tranche\" for financial accuracy.  \n- Use present tense (\"is issued\") to reflect the ongoing relevance of the program.  \n- Maintain a full declarative sentence structure for clarity and formality.  \nThe final translation balances precision, fluency, and adherence to the dictionary terms.\n\n# November 24\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research has published its third Applied Research report titled \"The Green Bond Market in Hong Kong: Developing a Robust Ecosystem for Sustainable Growth\".\n\n# November 27\n\nThe HKMA announced its appointment as Chair of the Study Group on Resolution of EMEAP; the group is a dedicated resolution regime organization providing support for knowledge sharing and discussions on cross-border resolution among relevant authorities in the region.\n\n# December 6th\n\nThe Faster Payment System has launched a new feature allowing citizens to link their bank accounts through banks using their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers to receive funds disbursed by institutions.\n\n# December 14 to 15\n\nThe Centre for Green Finance, established by the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, jointly hosted the inaugural IFC Climate Business Webinar with the International Finance Corporation.\n\n# December 17\n\nThe Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group has released a strategic plan for green and sustainable finance, outlining six areas to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem.\n\n# December 21\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) payment function has been extended to government payment counters and self-service machines.\n\n# December 22\n\nThe fifth batch of Silver Bonds was issued under the Government Bond Programme.\n\n# December 17, 21, and 22\n\nThe HKMA led a delegation from the Hong Kong Association of Banks to hold an annual meeting with mainland financial regulators via video conferencing tools, discussing recent developments in the financial sectors of both regions.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# December 18th\n\nThe HKMA announced that it will conduct a market survey on the \"Hong Kong Growth Portfolio,\" which is part of the government's \"Future Fund.\"\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# November 13\n\nThe HKMA launched the public education online drama series \"STEPS\" on its social media platforms to introduce its work across different areas.\n\n# December 31st\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA made available an additional 11 sets of financial data published on its website through the Open Application Programming Interface for free public use.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translations all correctly use the dictionary terms (HKMA, financial data, Open Application Programming Interface). However, they vary in fluency and structure. The most natural flow places the time (\"In 2020\") at the beginning, as in translations 2, 3, 4, and 5. The verb \"made available\" (used in translations 2, 3, and 6) is more precise than \"opened up\" or \"released\" for describing data accessibility. The phrase \"for free public use\" (translations 1, 2, 4, 5) is more idiomatic than \"free of charge\" (translation 6) or \"public free use\" (translation 3). The relative clause \"which were published on its website\" (translation 5) adds unnecessary complexity. The best structure combines clarity, concision, and natural phrasing, as seen in translation 2 but refined to avoid redundancy.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year US Treasury yields"],"2018鈔票系列":["2018 Series of Banknotes"],"2020年對外部門報告":["External Sector Report

Consumption and tourism-related industries were particularly hard hit, contracting more sharply than the overall economy. Meanwhile, the labour market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. To address the challenging economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the largest-ever relief measures to support the economy. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to restore normal economic activity, with growth anticipated in 2021. However, the strength and pace of economic recovery will remain influenced by numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 6.1% in 2020, marking the second consecutive year of contraction and the worst annual decline on record (Table 1). The sharp drop in economic activity was primarily due to a drastic contraction in local demand (Figure 1). The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding social distancing measures severely impacted local consumption activities. Due to the deteriorating business environment, overall investment spending also significantly decreased. Externally, although the pandemic caused supply chain disruptions and global demand contraction, Hong Kong's total goods exports only slightly declined for the year, partly benefiting from the rapid resumption of production and economic activities in mainland China. In contrast, due to lockdowns, border closures, and travel restrictions that brought the global tourism industry to a standstill, Hong Kong's service exports suffered a severe decline. Weak demand driven by local and re-export activities also led to a decline in goods imports and service inputs. As the decline in import volumes outpaced that of exports, net exports (trade surplus) provided support to the gross domestic product (Figure 1). By economic sector, consumption and tourism-related industries, such as retail, accommodation, and food services, were hit especially hard, with contractions worse than the overall economy, while the financial sector experienced moderate growth.\n\nTable 1: Growth of Real GDP by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFigure 1: Contributions of Components to Real GDP Growth\n\nThe government swiftly introduced the largest-scale relief measures in history through the 2020–21 Budget to respond to the pandemic, disbursing four rounds of subsidies totaling over HK$300 billion from the Anti-Epidemic Fund. These measures included a one-time cash payment of HK$10,000 to eligible residents, wage subsidies through the \"Job Retention Scheme,\" and one-time grants, rent reductions, and fee waivers for industries severely impacted by the pandemic. The HKMA supported the banking sector through a three-pronged approach to underpin the real economy. These measures included actively coordinating with the banking sector to alleviate liquidity pressures on businesses and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks’ lending capacity, and ensuring banks have sufficient liquidity to support local economic activities.\n\n#inflation\n\nInflationary pressures clearly weakened in 2020. Excluding the impact of one-time government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the global financial crisis of 2009. Price pressures for basic food items, especially fresh pork, significantly eased; and apart from home cooking, dining out prices also declined in the second half of the year due to substantial discounts offered by the catering industry. With the recent decline in newly signed private residential rents, the growth of the consumer price inflation's rental component also softened (Figure 2). More broadly, local business cost pressures decreased due to slower Nominal wage growth and softer commercial property rents; and under the weak world economy, import price inflation eased.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation\n\n# labour market\n\nThe labour market deteriorated rapidly in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate surged from 3.3% to 6.6% within the year, reaching a 16-year high (Figure 3), with unemployment rates exceeding 10% in sectors severely impacted by the pandemic, such as retail, accommodation, and food services. The underemployment rate also rose to 3.8% in August, the highest since the SARS outbreak. Partly due to cyclical responses to the rapid deterioration of economic conditions, the labour force participation rate slightly decreased. Total employment numbers (Figure 3) and private-sector job vacancies fell sharply, reflecting further contraction in overall labour demand. Growth in nominal wages and income slowed further. The government introduced the \"Job Protection\" plan, providing employers with time-limited financial support to retain employees, offering the labour market a certain degree of support.\n\nFigure 3: Labour Market Status\n\n# Stock Market\n\nWith the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hang Seng Index plummeted to a three-year low in the first quarter. Following large-scale support measures introduced by central banks and governments around the world, the stock market stabilized slightly in the second and third quarters (Figure 4). Due to breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccine development, the stock market regained some upward momentum toward the end of the year. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 points by year-end, recording a 3.4% annual decline. Benefiting from secondary listings of mainland Chinese companies in Hong Kong, the total fundraising from initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong in 2020 amounted to approximately HK$400 billion, ranking second globally in terms of fundraising.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe junior translations are generally accurate but vary in fluency and precision. Key strengths include correct use of dictionary terms (e.g., \"HKMA,\" \"non-residential property market,\" \"Doubled Ad Valorem Stamp Duty\") and adherence to the original structure. However, weaknesses include inconsistent phrasing (e.g., \"hitting a low\" vs. \"hitting bottom\"), minor grammatical issues (e.g., \"vacancy\" instead of \"vacancy rates\"), and redundancy (e.g., \"demand management measure\" repeated unnecessarily). The fifth translation excels in clarity and conciseness, while the sixth uses \"abolished\" instead of \"revoked\" (which better matches \"撤銷\"). The best version integrates precise terminology, natural phrasing, and contextual nuance.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nPartly supported by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market remained largely stable in 2020 (Figure 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes showed little change compared to the previous year. However, reduced household incomes tightened housing affordability further. On the other hand, the non-residential property market weakened further, with property prices declining by varying degrees and transaction volumes hitting bottom. Affected by the economic downturn and rising vacancy rates, rents for office buildings and retail spaces fell sharply. Given that the non-residential property market had already experienced significant adjustments since 2019 and was expected to face continued pressure, along with other factors such as the economic outlook and external environment, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to the decline in market demand, the government also revoked the Doubled Ad Valorem Stamp Duty on the purchase of non-residential properties, a demand management measure, in November.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate and fluent, but several nuances and stylistic choices could be refined. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: All translations correctly use the dictionary terms (e.g., \"real GDP,\" \"international organisations,\" \"private-sector\"). However, \"real local GDP\" (third translation) is redundant, as \"GDP\" inherently refers to local production in this context.\n2. **Verb Choice**: \"Restore\" (used in translations 3, 4, 6) is more precise than \"allow\" or \"enable\" for \"恢復\" (restore). \"Economic activity\" (singular) aligns better with the original \"經濟活動\" than \"economic activities\" (plural) in translations 2, 4, 6.\n3. **Temporal Phrasing**: \"For the full year of 2021\" (translation 4) is more natural than \"annual total\" (translations 2, 3) or \"for the whole year\" (translation 5).\n4. **Clarity of Forecast Alignment**: The phrase \"consistent with the average growth forecast of 4.4% for Hong Kong by international organisations and private-sector analysts\" (translation 5) is clearer than alternatives that omit \"for Hong Kong\" or use \"aligning with.\"\n5. **Redundancy and Flow**: \"Real local GDP\" (translation 3) and \"the mainland\" (translations 1, 2, 6) are less precise than \"real GDP\" and \"Mainland China,\" respectively. The phrase \"considerable challenges\" (translations 1, 3, 5) is slightly more formal than \"significant challenges\" (translations 2, 4, 6), but both are acceptable.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nVaccination against COVID-19 is expected to restore economic activity to normal, with Hong Kong's economy projected to return to positive growth for the full year of 2021. However, the strength and pace of the economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness. Specifically, widespread vaccination will take time, so the local economy will still face considerable challenges in the early part of 2021. Externally, Mainland China's economy is expected to further strengthen, providing support for Hong Kong's exports of goods and services. However, the recovery pace of other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of their large-scale vaccination programs. The government forecasts that real GDP growth in 2021 will be between 3.5% and 5.5%, consistent with the average growth forecast of 4.4% for Hong Kong by international organisations and private-sector analysts.\n\n# InflationAndLabourMarket\n\nGiven the continued challenges in the global and local economic conditions, inflation pressure in 2021 is expected to remain mild. Furthermore, the transmission effect of recent declines in private residential rents will continue to suppress local inflation. Market consensus forecasts the headline inflation rate for 2021 at 1.5%, while the government expects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Due to the continued challenges in the economic outlook during the early part of 2021, combined with private-sector analysts' expectations that the unemployment rate will remain at a relatively high level of around 5.9% throughout the year, the labour market is expected to remain under pressure in the short term.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient in 2020, with banks maintaining sound financial conditions. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, banking balance sheets continued to expand, with increased deposit funds. The banking sector maintained ample capital and liquidity, although asset quality slightly deteriorated, it remained at a stable level.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheets expanded by 5.7% in 2020. Due to the economic downturn, credit growth slowed to 1.2% for the year, compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019; loans used in Hong Kong rose by 2.2%, while loans used outside Hong Kong increased slightly by 0.1%, and trade finance declined by 6.2%. Mainland-related lending fell slightly by 0.2% in 2020, compared to a 7.4% growth recorded in 2019.  \nThe banking sector’s balance sheets expanded by 5.7% in 2020. Due to the economic downturn, credit growth slowed to 1.2% for the year, compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019; loans used in Hong Kong rose by 2.2%, while loans used outside Hong Kong increased slightly by 0.1%, and trade finance declined by 6.2%. Mainland-related lending fell slightly by 0.2% in 2020, compared to a 7.4% growth recorded in 2019.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the bank's balance sheet, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared to a 2.9% increase in 2019. Due to the faster growth of total deposits relative to total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Figure 5).\nOn the liabilities side of the bank's balance sheet, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared to a 2.9% increase in 2019. Due to the faster growth of total deposits relative to total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking Sector\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector's capital position remained robust in 2020, providing a strong buffer against potential shocks. By the end of 2020, the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions remained stable compared to the end of 2019, at 20.7%. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased slightly from 18.5% to 18.7% during the same period (Figure 6).\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio remained stable at 8.2% at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6: Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Status\n\nThe banking sector's liquidity position remains robust, with the capacity to withstand liquidity shocks during stress periods. Category 1 institutions' quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) stood at 155.1% in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the 100% statutory minimum requirement. Category 2 institutions' quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio (LMR) was 57.9%, also significantly above the 25% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\n\nThe banking sector's funding sources remain stable. As of the end of 2020, category 1 institutions’ Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 138.6%, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Category 2A institutions’ Core Funding Ratio (CFR) was 139.5%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\n\n# asset quality\n\nUnder the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, asset quality in the banking sector declined slightly during the year but remained sound by historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio increased from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio rose from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Figure 10). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. The delinquency ratios for residential mortgage loans and credit card lending remained at low levels, at 0.04% and 0.27%, respectively (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 10: Asset Quality of the Banking Sector\n\nFigure 11: Delinquency Ratio of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Lending\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate, with minor variations in phrasing and formality. All translations correctly use the dictionary terms (e.g., \"loan impairment charges,\" \"retail banks,\" \"net interest margin\"). However, differences in fluency and precision exist:\n1. **\"Low-interest environment\" vs. \"low-interest-rate environment\"**: The latter is more precise, as \"interest rate\" explicitly refers to the monetary policy context.\n2. **\"Slight decline\" vs. \"slight deterioration\"**: \"Deterioration\" better captures the negative connotation of declining asset quality.\n3. **\"Profitability\" vs. \"profits\"**: \"Profitability\" is more technically accurate in financial contexts.\n4. **\"Coupled with\" vs. \"combined with\"**: Both are acceptable, but \"coupled with\" adds a slight nuance of interdependence.\nThe fifth translation excels in formality and precision, using \"low-interest-rate environment\" and \"deterioration.\" However, it could benefit from tighter phrasing (e.g., \"put pressure on the profitability\" vs. \"put pressure on the profitability of the banking sector\"). The first and fourth translations are also strong but slightly less formal.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe low-interest-rate environment, coupled with a slight deterioration in asset quality, has put pressure on the profitability of the banking sector. The overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks decreased by 29.4% in 2020 (Figure 12), primarily due to a decline in net interest income (-21.9%) and an increase in loan impairment charges (+61.3%). The net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Figure 13).  \nThe low-interest-rate environment, coupled with a slight deterioration in asset quality, has put pressure on the profitability of the banking sector.

The net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Figure 13).\n\nDue to decreased income, the cost-to-income ratio of retail banks rose from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 12: Performance of retail banks\n\nFigure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\n\nFigure 14: Cost-to-income ratio of retail banks\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖 1 2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖 3 2020 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2020年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 其他事務\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2020年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港經濟的情景分析、香港物業市場的評估、了解跨境資金流的概念架構，以及了解香港銀行同業市場。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

Supported by substantial equity-related inflows, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered on multiple occasions. The Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system, fully demonstrating its strong capacity to withstand shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar's exchange value and keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts the Currency Board system, which stipulates that THE EXCHANGE FUND's US dollar reserves must provide at least 100% support for the monetary base; any changes in the monetary base must be matched by corresponding increases or decreases in the US dollar reserves, ensuring a 100% alignment with changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation  \n- Clearing account balances held at the HKMA (i.e., the Aggregate Balance)  \n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling Convertibility Undertakings. When a strong (or weak) Convertibility Undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will, at the request of banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars) at a rate of HK$7.75 per US dollar (or HK$7.85 per US dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) the Aggregate Balance, which lowers (or raises) the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and prompts the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nWith the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, risk-averse sentiment led global investors to increase their holdings of U.S. dollars, significantly tightening U.S. dollar liquidity. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), as Hong Kong dollar interest rates are influenced by contemporaneous U.S. dollar interest rates, the tightness in U.S. dollar liquidity tightened Hong Kong’s monetary conditions. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve subsequently implemented liquidity programmes, easing U.S. dollar funding pressures, Hong Kong’s monetary conditions remained relatively tight due to demand for equity securities and the quarter-end effect. Strong demand for Hong Kong dollars, coupled with the positive interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar stimulating carry trade activities, pushed the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate toward the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking rate (Figure 1), which was ultimately triggered in April. Subsequently, a robust initial public offering (IPO) market, along with southbound capital flows under Stock Connects, drove inflows of equity securities-related funds, keeping the Hong Kong dollar consistently close to the 7.75 level and causing the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking to be triggered multiple times in 2020. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 85 times between April 21 and October 28, resulting in cumulative inflows of HKD 383.5 billion. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2020.\n\nFigure 1: 2020 Market Exchange Rate\n\nAggregate Balance (before Discount Window activity) and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers rose from HK$1,133 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$1,526.6 billion at the end of 2020 (Figure 2). Following the activation of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking, the HKMA sold a total of HK$383.5 billion in response to banks' requests. The global macroeconomic volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the HKMA to gradually reduce the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes by a total of HK$20 billion in late April and early May to provide additional Hong Kong dollar liquidity. Due to the activation of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking and the reduced issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes, the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window activity) increased from HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers decreased slightly from HK$1,078.7 billion to HK$1,069.2 billion during the year, reflecting the reduced issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes, which offset the usual practice of issuing new Exchange Fund Bills and Notes to absorb interest payments on outstanding Exchange Fund papers. The overall Monetary Base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2020 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers\n\n# Money Markets\n\nFollowing the Lunar New Year holiday, liquidity demand declined, leading to a general decrease in Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in February (Figure 3). In March, HIBORs temporarily rose due to U.S. dollar funding pressures, along with local factors such as funding requirements related to new share offerings and quarter-end liquidity needs. Subsequently, the triggering of the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking and the reduced issuance of Exchange Fund Bills led to an increase in Aggregate Balance, gradually easing the liquidity situation for Hong Kong dollars.\n\nFollowing two reductions in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range in March, as well as reflecting changes in overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) during the year, the Base Rate decreased from 2.73% at the beginning of the year to 0.50% at year-end. At the retail front, despite the reduction in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range, banks maintained their Best Lending Rates unchanged. Overall, Hong Kong money markets continued to operate normally. Discount window lending fell from HKD 38.3 billion in 2019 to HKD 9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nFigure 3: 2020 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor over 30 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a crucial pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, consistently demonstrating strong resilience against shocks. Despite challenges in 2020, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate normally, repeatedly proving the LERS’s stability and effectiveness. Throughout the year, amid some unfounded rumors questioning the LERS and Hong Kong’s financial stability, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly reaffirmed to the public that Hong Kong would continue to implement the LERS, emphasizing that the free flow of capital and the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar are protected under Article 112 of the Basic Law. The HKMA also published several articles clarifying the fact that Hong Kong’s financial system continues to demonstrate strong resilience against shocks even in adverse conditions. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. The orderly operation of Hong Kong’s financial markets and the continued normal use of the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and store of value reflect the effectiveness of the aforementioned measures in maintaining public confidence in the LERS. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in the External Sector Report 2020 that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, all of which ensure the credibility of the LERS.\n\nA robust banking sector plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong banking sector has continued to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels being exceptionally ample by international standards. To ensure the banking sector's ability to withstand shocks, the HKMA has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and has maintained regulatory oversight of bank lending. At the same time, the HKMA has provided additional liquidity to the banking sector to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition to reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills to increase Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA has established a series of liquidity facilities for banks. Furthermore, the HKMA maintains communication with banks to ensure they can utilize these liquidity facilities during times of stress. In response to the volatility and uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in global financial markets, the HKMA introduced a temporary US Dollar Liquidity Facility to provide US dollar liquidity support to licensed banks, helping to alleviate liquidity strains in the global US dollar interbank money markets.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board Account, since October 1998, part of THE EXCHANGE FUND's assets have been designated as Backing Assets for the Monetary Base. The Backing Ratio (i.e., the ratio of Backing Assets to the Monetary Base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio closed at 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under LERS, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. THE EXCHANGE FUND's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's sound banking sector, provide a strong backing for monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuations of Backing Ratio in 2020\n\n# Other Matters\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2020, the Currency Board Sub-Committee examined topics including scenario analysis of the Hong Kong economy, an assessment of the Hong Kong property market, understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border fund flows, and understanding the Hong Kong interbank market. Minutes of the Currency Board Sub-Committee meetings and the HKMA’s operational reports on the Currency Board system are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Currency Research\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) maintained a certain level of research output in 2020. In 2020, HKIMR published a total of 20 research papers covering a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure, and fintech development. Some of these papers have been accepted or are currently under review for publication in professional journals. Due to social distancing measures and travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic, major activities hosted by HKIMR, such as seminars, lectures, and Visiting Research Programmes, had to be postponed. These activities will be resumed once public health and travel conditions return to normal.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of banknotes in circulation (referring to banknotes issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 559.5 billion, an increase of 8.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 5, 6, and 7). The total value of government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation was HKD 12.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the previous year (Figures 8 and 9). Among the government-issued currency notes and coins, the total value of HKD 10 banknotes in circulation was HKD 4.6 billion, of which polymer notes accounted for 79%.\n\nFigure 5: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation Analyzed by Note-Issuing Banks as of the End of 2020\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 7: Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2020.\n\nFigure 8: Circulating Value of Government-Issued Paper Currency and Coins as of the End of 2020\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Banknotes and Coins as of the End of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nFollowing the launch of new HK$20 and HK$50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 series banknotes have been in circulation. This series features more durable and user-friendly anti-counterfeiting features, which have been well-received by the public and are gradually replacing older versions.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued to host seminars introducing the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKMA organized eight seminars (including online sessions), enhancing public understanding of Hong Kong banknotes and attracting over 2,000 participants, including bank tellers, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme was launched in October 2014 and continued to be widely popular with the public throughout the year. It is the world’s first systematic mobile coin collection programme, featuring two Coin Carts that rotate through all 18 districts across Hong Kong. Each Coin Cart is equipped with two high-speed coin counting machines, allowing citizens to exchange coins for cash, top up Octopus cards or e-wallets (stored value facilities), or deposit funds into the Community Chest donation boxes inside the carts. In addition, the HKMA collaborated with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy Coin Carts during non-governmental organisations’ flag days to collect coins. The Coin Carts also visit schools to enhance students’ understanding of the Coin Collection Programme. Over the years, the programme has received numerous local and international awards, recognizing its innovative and environmentally friendly approach.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year US

Throughout the year, the HKMA closely monitored the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and regulatory activities, responding flexibly while continuing to focus regulatory efforts on credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. Given the increasing cyber threats and the rising trend of fintech adoption in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its regulatory oversight of technology risk management and operational resilience of authorized institutions. The HKMA also closely collaborated with banks and international organisations to facilitate the industry's transition to alternative reference rates.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA provides authorized institutions with regulatory flexibilities and guidance to assist banks in maintaining operations during the pandemic while continuing to serve customers, and to ensure ongoing protection for investors and consumers. The HKMA, together with relevant authorities, has developed proposed implementation guidelines for the Wealth Management Connect pilot scheme and consulted the industry. The HKMA collaborates with the Securities and Futures Commission to provide guidance on streamlining sales procedures for family offices and sophisticated investors with high net worth who are experienced in financial matters. Additionally, the HKMA has strengthened safeguards for consumers of digital financial services and continues to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nIn combating AML\/CFT, the HKMA has swiftly taken action, clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can assist authorized institutions in more effectively addressing situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also prudently addressing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking sector. The HKMA continues to support measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of AML\/CFT efforts, including increasing the number of authorized institutions participating in public-private partnership information sharing, and supporting the banking sector’s adoption of regulatory technology. In line with international trends in technology and data utilization, the HKMA is launching further plans to strengthen its AML\/CFT surveillance capability.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is closely collaborating with the banking sector to optimize supervisory policies and procedures, as well as implement capacity-building initiatives. Hong Kong has made commendable progress in implementing international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards and disclosure standards. In promoting the development of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second stage of three stages and is currently formulating relevant regulatory requirements. The HKMA also continues to strive to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including the formulation of new resolution standards and the implementation of rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements, to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the HKMA's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking sector. Achieving this goal relies on establishing and maintaining a financial sector with high resilience and capable of providing the essential financial services required for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking sector through their operational methods, or even in extreme cases, through disorderly closures. As a regulatory authority, the Monetary Authority plays an important role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks are capable of withstanding shocks, responding to crises, and recovering to normal operations after a crisis, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure the financial sector is entirely free of risk, and Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Monetary Authority strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its failure can be orderly managed. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution regime for financial institutions, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (and other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong’s resolution regime, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and build the HKMA’s operational capacity to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the above tasks, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nThe HKMA conducted 186 off-site reviews in 2020, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL rating assessments, corporate governance, risk management, and fintech strategies of authorized institutions. To further enhance the risk governance levels of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 30 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of directors, and held 30 trilateral meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA also conducts regular on-site examinations, complemented by thematic reviews, to assess areas identified as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 610 on-site examinations and thematic reviews, continuing to prioritize credit risk management as one of its key focus areas. Another key focus was operational risk and technology risk management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the HKMA increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management. At the same time, specialist teams conducted on-site examinations and thematic reviews of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the HKMA has maintained its regulatory rigor and implemented flexible arrangements to effectively fulfill its regulatory responsibilities, including providing regulatory flexibilities in the submission of reports and conducting on-site examinations; enhancing data collection to complement on-site examinations, as well as utilizing virtual meeting platforms.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA's regulatory work in 2020.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe total loan amount increased by 1.2% in 2020, compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019. Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nIn 2020, the total amount of Mainland-related lending slightly decreased by 0.2% to HKD 4.553 trillion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth of Mainland-related Lending\n\nThe asset quality of authorized institutions slightly deteriorated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the year, the classified loan ratio in the banking sector rose from 0.57% to 0.90%, remaining at a robust level, well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. Regarding Mainland-related lending, the relevant ratio also increased from 0.75% a year ago to 0.96%.\n\nGiven the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have posed significant challenges to the economy, the HKMA has conducted an in-depth review of the asset quality of authorized institutions to assess trends of deteriorating asset quality. In particular, the HKMA has enhanced its monitoring of large borrowers and sectors more vulnerable to the current economic environment by collecting data on credit risk exposures at the sectoral- and borrower-levels. The stress test analysis conducted by the HKMA indicates that banks are capable of withstanding the economic pressures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted thematic reviews to examine the credit risk management practices of authorized institutions across different areas, including Mainland-related lending, interbank lending, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\n# Measures to Alleviate Customers' Cash Flow Pressure\nThe original text emphasizes financial relief for customers related to cash flow management. All translations capture the core meaning, but there are subtle differences in terminology and nuance. The term \"資金周轉\" is most accurately rendered as \"cash flow\" rather than \"fund turnover,\" which is less idiomatic in financial contexts. \"客戶\" is appropriately translated as \"customers\" rather than \"clients,\" as the former is more neutral and widely used in business contexts. The use of \"pressure\" (singular) is preferable to \"pressures\" (plural) for consistency with the original's singular form. While \"financial pressure\" is grammatically correct, it is too broad and does not specifically capture the cash flow aspect. The most fluent and precise translation maintains \"cash flow pressure\" and uses \"customers\" for consistency and clarity.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism in October 2019. This mechanism introduced multiple rounds of relief measures to assist both corporate and individual customers, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers’ financing needs under the principle of prudent risk management. The most significant initiative was the PPPHS program launched by the Coordination Mechanism in May. Under this program, all eligible corporate customers could defer principal repayments on their loans for six months. The program was extended for another six months in November and again in March 2021 for a further six months until the end of October. Approximately 100 banks participated in the program, covering around 120,000 eligible corporate customers. By the end of December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of corporate loan deferrals and other support measures, involving a total amount exceeding HKD 740 billion.  \nFor individual customers, banks also introduced a residential mortgage \"interest-only payment\" plan, which included mortgages for properties under the Home Ownership Scheme. In addition, banks provided emergency loans to customers in industries severely affected by the pandemic, extended personal loan terms, and reduced fees for various personal credit products. By the end of December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of residential mortgage \"interest-only payment\" and other personal emergency loan applications, involving a total amount exceeding HKD 44 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Lending\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate, with all dictionary terms correctly rendered. However, variations in phrasing and fluency exist. Key observations:\n1. **Strengths**: All translations correctly use \"HKMA,\" \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio,\" and \"mortgage insurance.\" The use of \"DSR\" (debt servicing ratio) is consistent where applicable. Most translations maintain the original structure and meaning effectively.\n2. **Weaknesses**: \n   - **Terminology**: Some translations use \"newly issued\" for \"新批出\" (newly approved), which is less precise in financial contexts. \"Newly approved\" is more standard for mortgage loans.\n   - **Fluency**: Phrases like \"resilience of the banking sector in Hong Kong to withstand\" (Translation 4) are slightly wordy. \"Resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector\" is more concise.\n   - **Consistency**: Translation 5 uses \"related ratio cap,\" which is vague. \"DSR ceiling\" (Translation 2) is clearer.\n3. **Improvements**: \n   - Use \"newly approved\" for \"新批出\" to align with financial terminology.\n   - Prefer \"DSR ceiling\" over \"ratio cap\" for clarity.\n   - Ensure parallel structure in comparisons (e.g., \"compared to 64% before the first round...\").\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe HKMA has introduced several rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures since 2009, which have strengthened banks' risk management and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to a sudden reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2020, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average LTV ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans increased in 2020, mainly due to a higher proportion of loans involving mortgage insurance, which typically carry higher LTV ratios. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) for newly approved mortgages has remained at a low level, at 37% in December 2020, compared to 41% when the DSR ceiling was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nConsidering the original text and the junior translators' work, the best translation should maintain precise terminology from the dictionary, ensure grammatical correctness, and preserve the nuance of the original. All translations correctly use the required terms (e.g., \"HKMA,\" \"loan-to-value ratio caps\"), but differences in phrasing and flow exist. Key issues include:  \n- **\"Economic fundamentals\"** (used by translators 4 and 6) is more precise than \"economic outlook\" or \"economic climate\" for \"經濟基調.\"  \n- **\"Cap\"** (dictionary term) should be used consistently over \"ceiling\" (translator 6) or \"limit\" (translator 5).  \n- **Sentence structure** in translators 1, 4, and 6 is clearer, avoiding run-on clauses.  \n- **\"Transaction volume\"** (translator 1) is more natural than \"trading volumes\" (translators 4, 6).  \nThe optimal translation balances clarity, precision, and fluency while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms.  \nTaking the above into account, the improved translation is:  \nTaking into account the price trends and transaction volume of nonresidential properties, as well as economic fundamentals and external environment, the HKMA relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage loans on non-residential properties in August, raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio caps for such loans by 10 percentage points. The cap for general cases was increased from 40% to 50%.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio and Debt Servicing Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Regulatory oversight of business operations and technology risks.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the HKMA implemented a series of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. These measures included requiring authorized institutions to review their business continuity plans and take appropriate preventive measures to safeguard the health of employees and customers, as well as to maintain essential banking services. Additionally, the HKMA reminded authorized institutions to enhance communication with employees and customers, prepare for the possibility of confirmed cases at their premises, and develop business continuity plans to address more severe but potentially occurring risk scenarios. The HKMA maintained close contact with the industry and urged authorized institutions to remain vigilant, regularly reviewing their business continuity plans in light of the latest developments in the pandemic and the government's social distancing measures.\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) and extensive industry consultations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched CFI 2.0 in November to further enhance the CFI in line with the latest international practices in cyber risk management. The Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF) under CFI 2.0 has incorporated the latest internationally recognized robust practices regarding incident response and recovery. Under the Professional Development Programme within the CFI, the scope of the qualification recognition list has been expanded to include equivalent qualifications from major overseas regions. The HKMA also proposed several recommendations to the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to make the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform more user-friendly. CFI 2.0 took effect on January 1, 2021.\n\n# Smart Bank\n\nAfter undergoing rigorous testing and trials in the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, all eight virtual banks that received banking licences in 2019 have launched operations within the year. Virtual banks leverage innovative technology to provide new customer experiences, such as using big data analytics for credit assessments of SME loans to expedite the loan approval process. To strengthen customer engagement and build brand loyalty, some virtual banks have incorporated gamification elements into their services, including fixed deposits and reward programs.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nThe HKMA introduced a series of measures in April to ensure the smooth operation of the interbank market and the banking sector during the pandemic. These measures included clarifying the operational details of the HKMA liquidity facilities and launching a temporary US dollar liquidity facility, while reiterating the flexibility for authorized institutions to utilize liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted exercises with authorized institutions to ensure they are prepared to apply these measures when necessary.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

This year, the HKMA implemented multiple measures to promote the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment industries. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the Faster Payment System \"Zhuan Shu Kuai\" saw a sharp increase.\n\nHong Kong is strategically positioned at the forefront of China's financial market opening-up, enabling it to fully capitalize on the opportunities arising from this process. With world-class market infrastructure and mechanisms such as the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, and Bond Connect, Hong Kong serves not only as a highly favored fundraising platform for mainland enterprises but also as a gateway for international investors to access the rapidly growing mainland market. This year has seen significant progress in promoting financial cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, particularly in facilitating Hong Kong residents' use of financial and banking services within the region.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including strengthening the competitiveness of asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and sustainable finance. The HKMA is also intensifying its market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders. On a global level, the HKMA plays a leading role in various regional and international committees, fully highlighting Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment in related international initiatives.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as Asia's fintech hub, the HKMA continues to implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology in the banking and payment industries. Key developments this year include:  \n- Promoting wider adoption of the Faster Payment System;  \n- Encouraging the banking sector to implement Open API;  \n- Connecting the trade finance platform \"eTradeConnect\" with the People’s Bank of China's trade finance blockchain platform to promote the digitization of trade finance;  \n- Researching the application of CBDC in cross-border payments;  \n- Exploring the technical feasibility of \"Commercial Data Interchange\" and researching alternative credit scoring models to help SMEs access financing;  \n- Announcing a two-year plan aimed at developing a larger and more diverse Regtech ecosystem to further promote the application of regulatory technology;  \n- Strengthening talent development; and  \n- Advancing cross-border fintech collaboration.\n\nThe HKMA's Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) collaborates with its banking departments to play a key role in promoting the aforementioned measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices begin to include onshore securities from mainland China or increase their weightings, inflows into renminbi assets continue to accelerate. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to play a key role in encouraging international investors to increase their allocation to renminbi assets, thanks to its connectivity with mainland capital markets through the \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" and \"Bond Connect.\" In 2020, the average daily trading volume of \"Bond Connect\" increased by 82%, reaching approximately 19.3 billion renminbi. To improve the operation of \"Bond Connect,\" the HKMA introduced new measures, including the introduction of a special settlement cycle service, extended trading hours, and new arrangements that provide investors with greater flexibility in choosing banks for currency conversion and foreign exchange hedging. Following the success of the \"Northbound Bond Connect,\" the HKMA formed a working group with the PBoC to study the framework for the \"Southbound Bond Connect.\"\n\nThe HKMA continues to strengthen financial arrangements between Hong Kong and mainland cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Mainland authorities have introduced a series of policy measures to support regional financial development. In June, the PBoC, HKMA, and Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) jointly announced the decision to implement cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect. The HKMA has been working closely with mainland and local authorities, as well as the industry, to formulate detailed implementation rules. The HKMA is also maintaining communication with mainland authorities regarding other measures, seeking to expand policy space for Hong Kong banks to broaden the scope of their cross-border business. Throughout the year, Hong Kong has continued to maintain its position as the global offshore renminbi business hub. The average daily transaction volume of Hong Kong’s renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a new high of RMB 120 billion.\n\nThe HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s fund business, the HKMA is working closely with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment for funds to establish themselves locally. The HKMA is also investing significant effort to further enhance Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. Meanwhile, the HKMA is strengthening market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nIn the central banking community, the HKMA plays a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. For example, the HKMA chairs the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA also serves as co-chair of the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) and the Financial Innovation Network (FIN) under the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a group exploring regulatory matters related to benchmark transition.\n\nThe secure and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for its status as an international financial centre. In 2020, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities depositories in mainland China, the CMU continues to facilitate the settlement of Northbound Bond Connect transactions and holds mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe usage of the Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow in 2020. By the end of 2020, a total of 6.9 million registrations had been recorded, with the annual transaction volume doubling compared to 2019. The government's acceptance of FPS for payments and the increased adoption by more merchants were the main reasons for the significant growth in transaction volume, beyond the steady growth in person-to-person payments via FPS.\n\nTo ensure the overall safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designates and supervises six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also continues to regulate 18 stored value facility (SVF) licensees.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Hong Kong's status as Asia's fintech hub\n\n# FPS\n\nSince the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) in September 2018, 35 banks and 12 stored value facilities operators have joined, with five additional banks and one additional stored value facility operator joining in 2020. FPS usage has also steadily increased. As of December 31, FPS had recorded 6.9 million registrations (Figure 1). To facilitate citizens in receiving payments from institutions, FPS introduced the use of Hong Kong Identity Card numbers as account identifiers starting from December 6. Within less than one month of introducing this feature, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This new feature is not intended for person-to-person transfers but is only for institutions to make payments to recipients whose Hong Kong Identity Card numbers are known (e.g., salary disbursements). Since each citizen's Hong Kong Identity Card number is unique, using the Hong Kong Identity Card number as an account identifier allows citizens to accurately receive payments even without providing their bank account numbers.\n\nFigure 1: Number of Faster Payment System Account Registrations\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, numerical precision, and phrasing. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology**: All translations correctly use \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" or \"FPS\" for 轉數快 and \"transaction volume\" for 交易量. However, \"commercial payments\" (商業支付) is more precise than \"business payments\" used in Translation 5.\n2. **Numerical Accuracy**: Translation 4 incorrectly states \"HKD 52 billion\" instead of the correct \"HKD 5.2 billion\" (52億港元). This is a critical error requiring correction.\n3. **Phrasing & Fluency**: \n   - \"New impetus\" (Translations 2, 4, 5) is slightly more idiomatic than \"new momentum\" (Translations 1, 3, 6).\n   - \"Equivalent to three times...\" (Translation 3) is more precise than \"which is three times...\" (Translations 1, 2, 5).\n   - \"Gradual expansion of its application scope\" (Translations 1, 3, 6) is preferable to \"gradual expansion of its applications\" (Translation 2).\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations appropriately use \"HK$\" and \"RMB\" for currency, and \"instant transactions\" aligns with the context of FPS.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have brought new impetus to the use of electronic payment services. The transaction volume of the Faster Payment System (FPS) grew particularly rapidly this year (Figure 2), reaching an average of 505,000 daily instant transactions in December 2020 (involving HK$5.2 billion and RMB 95 million), equivalent to three times the 168,000 transactions recorded in December 2019, and ten times the volume in the first month of FPS launch in October 2018. The increased use of FPS has also benefited from the gradual expansion of its application scope, evolving from primarily person-to-person payments to include bill payments (including government bills), retail, and commercial payments.\n\nFigure 2: Average Daily Transaction Volume of Hong Kong Dollar Real-Time Payments\n\nThe HKMA has been working with multiple government departments and the banking sector to expand the application of the Faster Payment System (FPS) from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant transactions. Since November 2019, the government has accepted FPS for bill payments to promote its use and facilitate citizens. Citizens can easily pay taxes, rates, land rent, water charges, and general government bills by scanning the QR code printed on the bills using mobile banking apps or e-wallets that support FPS. As of December 2020, there were 1.8 million transactions made via FPS to pay government bills, involving a total amount of HK$2.2 billion. Following the successful launch of the government bill payment service, four more government departments started accepting FPS QR code payments at designated payment counters and self-service machines from December 21, 2020. The government is also currently exploring arrangements for using FPS for online payments.\n\nAnother positive development is that an increasing number of businesses, both large and small, are adopting the Faster Payment System (FPS) to enhance their operations. The number of transactions involving merchant payments surged to an average of 100,000 per day in December 2020, a 38-fold increase compared to December 2019. FPS is commonly used for bill payments, in-app direct debits, and other online shopping activities. The growing popularity of e-wallets has also driven a significant increase in transaction volume for FPS-based account top-ups. The average daily transaction volume for account top-ups in December 2020 was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo enhance public awareness of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has produced various educational and promotional materials, including television advertisements and a series of smart usage tips on social media platforms. The HKMA also organized a secondary school WhatsApp Sticker design competition to increase students' understanding of electronic payments. In addition, the HKMA has promoted the use of FPS for payments and collections among multiple charitable organizations and market operators. Several FPS-participating banks and stored value facilities (SVF) operators have also launched promotional campaigns, including offering discounts to encourage customers to register and use FPS for fund transfers and bill payments. Building on the achievements of 2020, the HKMA collaborated with banks and SVF operators in early 2021 to promote the electronic distribution of red envelopes via FPS. On one hand, the HKMA launched promotional activities, while on the other hand, banks and SVF operators provided incentives to encourage customers to distribute red envelopes electronically, which is both environmentally friendly and helps combat the pandemic.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continues to promote the banking sector in developing and providing Open API in accordance with the Open API Framework. The framework is implemented in four phases, with banks having launched Open API for the first and second phases. These Open APIs are being used to collaborate with third-party service providers to develop innovative services and enhance customer experience. On the other hand, the HKMA is conducting research on the implementation of the third and fourth phases of Open API and published a booklet in November featuring the survey results.\n\n# eTradeConnect\n\nTo provide importers and exporters with more convenient trade finance services, the HKMA launched a proof-of-concept study this year to explore connecting eTradeConnect with the Trade Finance Platform under the PBoC. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of this year, followed by the commencement of a pilot program. Banks in Hong Kong and mainland China have successfully completed multiple cross-border trade finance transactions using this connection.\n\n# cross-border payments\n\nRegarding Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank of Thailand continue joint research to explore CBDC applications in cross-border payments, aiming to promote Payment versus Payment (PvP) settlement of Hong Kong dollars and Thai baht between banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. Both parties have completed the first phase of research and published a joint report in January outlining key findings; they have also developed a blockchain-based cross-border corridor network prototype to enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments and reduce costs. The second phase of the project has commenced, focusing on exploring commercial use cases for cross-border trade settlement and capital market transactions. Other central banks have also shown strong interest in the project. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced their participation in the project in early 2021.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year US

After experiencing significant adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, asset markets rebounded rapidly, driven by ultra-loose monetary policies introduced by major central banks and large-scale fiscal relief measures implemented by governments around the world. Due to major central banks significantly lowering benchmark interest rates and restarting quantitative easing programmes, sovereign bond yields fell sharply while bond prices rose. Under this investment environment, THE EXCHANGE FUND recorded HK$235.8 billion in investment income in 2020, with an investment return of 5.3%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. The HKMA is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers and terms of delegation conferred by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has established the following investment objectives for THE EXCHANGE FUND:  \n(a) To safeguard capital;  \n(b) To ensure that the Monetary Base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;  \n(c) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) To seek investment returns as far as possible, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to protect the Fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of THE EXCHANGE FUND and have been reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets, providing ample support for the Monetary Base as stipulated by the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bond markets and stock markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in order to safeguard the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium- to long-term returns, the HKMA has prudently and gradually allocated part of THE EXCHANGE FUND's assets into a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equity securities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equity securities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value ceiling of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of THE EXCHANGE FUND, plus the sum of the portions of deposits in the Future Fund and deposits in THE EXCHANGE FUND’s subsidiaries that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by THE EXCHANGE FUND for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the investment performance evaluation of THE EXCHANGE FUND does not include it.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from Fiscal Reserves, Government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a major exception. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, with the effective interest rate depending on the portfolio mix. The allocation of the Future Fund between the Investment Portfolio and the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is approximately 40:60.\n\n# the investment process\n\nThe investment process of THE EXCHANGE FUND is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected through the investment benchmark, which refers to the long-term asset allocation THE EXCHANGE FUND can make to achieve its investment objectives. THE EXCHANGE FUND uses strategic allocation as a guide, employing tactical asset allocation to aim for returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is termed \"tactical deviations.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limit. The HKMA is authorized to determine tactical asset allocation and establish the permissible range for tactical deviations. Portfolio managers can manage positions within this range to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) is specifically responsible for investment and related risk management functions. The office’s staff are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This portion of the Investment Portfolio includes investments in various global fixed-income markets and implements the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through derivative overlay portfolios.\n\n# External Fund Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the HKMA also employs external fund managers to oversee approximately 28% of THE EXCHANGE FUND’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external fund managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market to generate sustainable returns, enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, and gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to employing external fund managers include fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making the importance of risk management self-evident. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external fund managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has implemented three lines of defence for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and compliance. The HKMA also regularly monitors major categories of investment risk (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk), and has strengthened its risk management procedures to align with the Exchange Fund's investment diversification.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA supports Responsible Investment by incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management process of THE EXCHANGE FUND's public and private market investments.\n\nThe HKMA has established a set of principles to assess the ESG risks and opportunities of the Exchange Fund's investment projects. Regarding the asset portfolios managed by external fund managers, the HKMA implements responsible investment through appointed investment managers. In the process of selecting, appointing, and monitoring external fund managers, the HKMA evaluates their implementation of various aspects of ESG, including the organisational setup with respect to ESG governance, ESG standards and policies, the integration of ESG factors into investment processes, and stewardship activities, such as proxy voting and portfolio company engagement programme (e.g., discussing ESG matters with the management of portfolio companies). To demonstrate its commitment to responsible investment, the HKMA promotes more comprehensive ESG practices through the role of external fund managers in stewardship activities. External fund managers responsible for managing the HKMA's Hong Kong equity securities portfolio and the actively managed mainland China equity securities portfolio must commit to complying with the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission, and must provide explanations if they fail to comply. External fund managers responsible for managing developed market equities portfolios must adhere to international ESG standards. In addition, the HKMA has launched a post-appointment monitoring programme to review the implementation of proxy voting and portfolio company engagement programme by external fund managers.\n\nThe fixed-income portfolios managed by HKMA staff also integrate ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. By expanding the sources of ESG data and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, the analysis is further strengthened.\n\nRegarding ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has been an early investor in green, social, and sustainability bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015. In addition, the HKMA has participated in the International Finance Corporation’s \"Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program,\" with its investments focused on sustainable development projects in emerging markets. In 2020, coinciding with increased market supply, the HKMA expanded its investment in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to grow its ESG bond portfolio through direct investment or by holding ESG bond funds. Furthermore, the HKMA will promote external fund managers to establish ESG-themed equity mandates by adopting the ESG equities index as the investment benchmark for passive portfolios. In the coming years, the HKMA will continue to monitor ESG-themed investment opportunities, such as active ESG mandates and low-carbon investment themes.\n\nIn the private market investment area, the HKMA reviews the ESG policies and specific measures of GPs during the due diligence process. The HKMA's Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP) actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, and incorporates warehouses and other buildings with green and sustainable features into its real estate investment portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to seek out projects with sustainable characteristics and will include green accreditation as an important consideration in real estate investments. The HKMA holds annual ESG Workshops with GPs to exchange views and experiences on good ESG practices. At the ESG Workshop held in November, a number of GPs exchanged views on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their portfolio companies and the development of ESG investments. To enhance ESG transparency in private market investments, the HKMA has requested GPs to provide ESG information regarding their investment projects, such as climate change risks, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how to further integrate these standards into the investment process, including engaging with like-minded investors and international organisations. As one of the signatories of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, the HKMA shoulders the responsibility of being a global advocate and will participate in developing ESG best practices, encouraging other investors to adopt responsible investment approaches. The HKMA is also a member of the non-profit organisation FCLTGlobal, which aims to encourage long-term-oriented business and investment decisions through workshops and research. The HKMA is also involved in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and is a member of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). In addition, the HKMA organises seminars and actively participates in events hosted by the investment industry to share and promote the concept of ESG investments.\n\nThe original sentence is a formal directive directing readers to a specific chapter for information on the HKMA’s RI policy framework. All junior translations correctly use the dictionary terms (HKMA, RI policy, Corporate Social Responsibility) and maintain the core meaning. However, variations in phrasing and formality exist. \n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 1** and **2** use \"please refer to,\" which is polite and formal, aligning with the original’s tone. However, \"for details regarding\" in Translation 2 is slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 3** and **4** use passive voice (\"can be found in,\" \"is detailed in\"), which is grammatically correct but less direct than active phrasing.\n- **Translation 5** and **6** use \"see Chapter,\" which is concise but may feel abrupt in formal contexts. \"See\" is appropriate for \"詳見\" (see in detail), but the chapter title should be in quotes (as in all translations).\n**Improvements:**\n- Prioritize clarity and formality by using \"please refer to\" or \"see\" depending on context.\n- Ensure the chapter title is properly quoted and the phrasing is concise.\n**Best Translation:**  \n\"Please refer to the 'Corporate Social Responsibility' chapter for details on the HKMA’s RI policy framework.\"  \nThis version balances formality, clarity, and conciseness, adhering to the dictionary terms and the original’s intent.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\n# Financial Markets in 2020\n\nUnder the support of accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the major challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the global economy, global financial markets reached record highs by year-end. Global equity markets rebounded quickly after experiencing significant adjustments and volatility in the first quarter, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 16%, making it the best-performing G7 equity index in 2020.  \nSupported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the major challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic to the world economy, global financial markets rose to record highs by year-end. After experiencing significant correction and volatility in the first quarter, global equity markets quickly rebounded, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 16%, making it the best-performing G7 equity index in 2020.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields on bonds from major developed countries continued to face pressure following a significant decline in the first quarter. Ten-year US Treasury yields fell by approximately 100 basis points, from 1.9% at the start of the year to 0.9% by year-end. Due to the sharp rise in major government bond prices, substantial mark-to-market gains were recorded from the bond markets in 2020.\n\nIn the currency markets, the decline in U.S. interest rates narrowed interest rate differentials, prompting the U.S. dollar to weaken against major currencies. This trend became more pronounced in the second half of 2020, with the euro and the Chinese yuan appreciating against the U.S. dollar by approximately 9.0% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2020.\n\nTable 1: 2020 Market Returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, which included HK$92.7 billion in bond investment gains, HK$4.0 billion in gains from investments in equity securities in Hong Kong, HK$69.9 billion in gains from other equity securities investments, HK$9.6 billion in valuation gains from non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and HK$59.6 billion in other investment gains held by the Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the Strategic Portfolio recorded valuation gains of HK$14.0 billion.\n"}

公眾及消費者教育\n\n為與社區保持聯繫及增進市民對金管局工作的認識，金管局在2020年舉辦了一場網上公眾教育講座，吸引1,600多名來自61間中學的師生參加。講座內容涵蓋金管局工作簡介、聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、保障個人數碼鎖匙及存款保障計劃。教育講座自1998年推出以來，首次以網上形式舉行，至今已有超過61,000名師生參與。\n\n超過1,600名來自61間中學的師生參加金管局網上公眾教育講座。\n\n金管局教育公眾做個精明及負責任的金融服務消費者，並就此與公眾保持聯繫。相關教育工作的其中一個重點繼續是「保護個人數碼鎖匙」，年內金管局製作了一系列短片，呼籲市民不論何時何地都要妥善保管財務帳戶及個人資料。鑑於新冠病毒疫情下網上騙案有所增加，金管局提醒市民在網上購物或使用個人認證資料時要提高警覺，慎防詐騙圈套。\n\n為提高年青人加入金管局工作的興趣，金管局於2020年推出公眾教育網劇《STEPS》，並在社交媒體發布一系列相關貼文，介紹金管局在貨幣、聯繫匯率制度、金融科技、普及金融、銀行監管與國際合作等範疇的工作。\n\n公眾教育網劇《STEPS》以輕鬆的手法，透過一個新入職年青人的成長故事，介紹金管局的主要職能。\n\n金管局在數碼平台及戶外媒體廣泛宣傳保護個人數碼鎖匙的訊息。\n\n金管局又透過多個社區參與活動與不同持份者合作，而其中一項是網上親子理財教育活動 《小小理財師》，透過動畫影片、線上遊戲、自製玩具、可下載工作紙及填色比賽，教導幼稚園及初小學生金錢和理財的基本概念，以及有關銀行及支付服務的基本知識。\n\n以Dollar豬和金氏一家為主角的動畫影片，就五個主題發放訊息。\n\n示範以環保物料自製玩具。\n\n其他有關年青人教育的工作包括網上理財問答比賽及為中學生及老師而設的網上教育講座、與一個專業團體攜手製作以小學生及家長為對象的漫畫書，以及為大專學生舉辦網上講座。\n\n金管局支持投資者及理財教育委員會提升香港市民的金融理財知識及能力，並會研究與持份者進一步合作，提高社區參與的成效。\n\n# 金管局員工\n\n金管局是政府架構的一部分，但按非公務員條款聘請員工，吸引具適當經驗及專門知識的人才。金管局聘用、培訓及維持一支專業優秀的工作團隊，以履行政策目標及靈活應對工作要求的轉變。\n\n金管局在2020年的人手編制為1,005人。年內，金管局致力透過靈活調配現有資源、提升效率及精簡工作程序，以配合新項目的需要及日益繁重的工作。金管局在2021年的人手編制將維持1,005人，並會重新調配現有資源，應付下述新開展及有所擴展的工作：\n\n#

香港的國際金融中心地位\n- 為加強參與金融穩定理事會及其他國際工作小組提供支援\n- 管理新近建議的附帶權益稅務寬減制度，以及核實可合資格獲稅務寬減的基金\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n\n表 1 2021年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以作獎勵及保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬及浮動薪酬的款項；而適用於負責投資的員工的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁及以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

Internally, the HKMA is also committed to strengthening corporate governance, including supporting staff in enhancing professional development, maintaining financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and encouraging a culture of innovation to address the challenges posed by implementing new projects and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n#Stay Connected with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2020, the HKMA held a total of 93 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 5 stand-up interviews, and 80 other public events. It also arranged 14 media interviews and issued 552 bilingual press releases, while handling a large number of media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the HKMA's core activities, the HKMA hosts media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, as well as key opinion leaders, covering topics such as the Linked Exchange Rate System, Fintech, green finance, and macroprudential measures.\n\nMr. Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, hosted an online panel discussion at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020.\n\nArthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA (middle), hosted a press briefing to introduce the HKMA's two-year plan to promote regulatory technology.\n\nMr. Nelson Chow (left), HKMA Chief Fintech Officer, was interviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe HKMA enhances public understanding of its work and strengthens communication with the public through social media. It currently operates five social media pages, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube. As of December 31, 2020, over 66,500 users followed the HKMA's social media pages. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA effectively utilized social media to maintain contact with the public and clarify misinformation related to financial and banking stability.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the HKMA's core activities and operations. In 2020, it handled a total of 9,514 inquiries, approximately half of which related to banking sector policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, notes and coins, financial infrastructure, and debt market development, specifically the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, guidelines and announcements related to the banking sector, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, and currency and economic data.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2017, and Figure 2 shows the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Total Number of Public Queries\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2020, Listed by Type\n\n# Publication\n\nIn addition to the HKMA's Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year, and regularly updated the data in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, providing the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary affairs, banking sector, and economic matters. In addition, the HKMA published 18 Insights articles, introducing the HKMA's key measures and policies, and discussing matters of public concern.\n\nThe HKMA's 2019 Annual Report won a Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category at the Hong Kong Management Association's 2020 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA’s official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 40,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, enabling the public to access the HKMA’s latest information. The website also features the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions,\" maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website through Open APIs in phases since 2018. By the end of 2020, the HKMA had launched a total of 144 Open API sets on its website as scheduled.\n\nThe HKMA actively supports the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2, introducing the public to the HKMA's work and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre comprises an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector through interactive methods, and also provides materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall, the library houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on topics including Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions\" as stipulated in section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, thanks to its meticulously designed and unique atmosphere, stood out among thousands of entrants from around the world and won one of the Platinum Awards in the Interior Design category of the \"2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS.\"\n\nThe Information Centre took the opportunity presented by the temporary closure of the Policy Section in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic to upgrade its facilities. This section outlines the work of the HKMA and introduces related financial concepts. The upgrades were implemented in response to visitor feedback, making the interactive facilities more user-friendly, engaging, and durable, thereby enhancing the overall visitor experience.\n\nThe interactive facilities in the Policy Section of the Information Centre have been optimized.\n\nThe Information Centre’s exhibition section introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector.\n\nTo ensure that the public, regardless of race, can equally access the facilities of the Information Centre, the centre has established procedures to provide interpretation services for visitors in need and individuals calling the centre's hotline for inquiries.\n\nThe Information Centre’s opening hours and services have been affected due to the ongoing pandemic. To ensure public safety and maintain a high standard of hygiene, the Information Centre has implemented special opening arrangements and epidemic prevention measures this year, with enhanced cleaning and disinfection. Facilities and exhibits are also regularly disinfected using anti-microbial coating.\n\n# Public and Consumer Education\n\nTo stay connected with the community and enhance public understanding of the HKMA's work, the HKMA held an online public education seminar in 2020, attracting over 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, and the Deposit Protection Scheme. Since its launch in 1998, this was the first time the education seminar was held in an online format, with over 61,000 students and teachers participating to date.\n\nOver 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools participated in HKMA’s online public education seminar.\n\nThe HKMA educates the public to be savvy and responsible financial service consumers and maintains communication with the public on this matter. One of the key focuses of the related educational efforts continues to be \"Protection of personal digital keys.\" This year, the HKMA produced a series of short videos urging citizens to properly safeguard their financial accounts and personal information regardless of when or where. Given the increase in online scams during the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA reminds citizens to be vigilant when shopping online or using personal authentication information and to guard against fraud.\n\nTo increase young people’s interest in working at the HKMA, the HKMA launched the public education online drama series “STEPS” in 2020 and posted a series of related posts on social media, introducing the HKMA’s work in areas such as currency, the Linked Exchange Rate System, fintech, financial inclusion, banking regulation, and international cooperation.\n\nThe public education online drama series \"STEPS\" uses a light-hearted approach to introduce the HKMA's core activities through the growth story of a newly hired young person.\n\nThe HKMA widely promotes the message of Protection of personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\n\nThe HKMA has also collaborated with various stakeholders through multiple community engagement programmes, one of which is the online parent-child financial education activity \"Little Financial Managers.\" This initiative teaches kindergarten and primary school students basic concepts of money and financial management, as well as fundamental knowledge about banking and payment services, through animated videos, online games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets, and coloring contests.\n\nThe animated film featuring Dollar Pig and the Kim family conveys messages on five themes.\n\nDemonstrate making toys with eco-friendly materials.\n\nOther work related to youth education includes an online financial literacy quiz competition, online educational seminars for secondary school students and teachers, collaboration with a professional organization to produce comic books targeting primary school students and parents, as well as online seminars for university students.\n\nThe HKMA supports the Investor and Financial Education Council in enhancing the financial literacy and capabilities of Hong Kong residents and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement.\n\n# HKMA Staff\n\nThe HKMA is part of the government structure but employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent team to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work requirements.\n\nThe HKMA had a staffing level of 1,005 in 2020. Throughout the year, the HKMA focused on meeting the needs of new projects and increasing workloads by flexibly allocating existing resources, improving efficiency, and streamlining work processes. The HKMA's staffing level will remain at 1,005 in 2021, and existing resources will be reallocated to address the following new initiatives and expanded work areas:\n\n# Banking and Financial Sector Stability  \n- Support policy development for Wealth Management Connect (WMC), as well as other Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) initiatives related to private wealth management, and ongoing supervision of WMC operations  \n- Handle licensing under the Insurance Ordinance and the new OTC derivatives regime, as well as conduct supervision related to virtual banks  \n- Implement new regulatory requirements concerning climate risks, and enhance prudential supervision of banks\n\n# Reserves Management  \n- Strengthen investment, risk management, and other necessary support to align with the Exchange Fund's ongoing expansion and diversified investment activities.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre  \n- To provide support for enhanced participation in the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other international working groups  \n- To manage the newly proposed carried interest tax concession regime and verify the eligibility of funds for tax concessions\n\nTable 1 lists the position establishment and actual number of staff of the HKMA by department.\n\nTable 1: HKMA Staff Establishment and Actual Number of Staff as of 1 January 2021\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\nThe translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies. All versions correctly identify \"薪酬福利\" as \"Compensation and Benefits\" or \"Salary and Benefits,\" with \"compensation\" being the more inclusive term in HR contexts. However, the use of \"salary\" in some translations narrows the scope unnecessarily. The term \"檢討機制\" is consistently translated as \"Review Mechanism,\" which is appropriate. The repetition of \"Compensation\" in the first, fourth, and sixth translations is acceptable for clarity, though \"Compensation and Benefits Policy and Review Mechanism\" could be slightly more concise. The fifth translation's inclusion of a hashtag mirrors the original's formatting but may not be required unless explicitly requested. The best version balances consistency, standard HR terminology, and grammatical precision.\n\nThe Financial Secretary consults the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account market salary levels and practices, to determine the compensation and service conditions for Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees. The compensation package includes cash compensation and a provident fund scheme, along with some basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a monthly fixed salary (i.e., basic salary) and variable pay, which is paid annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of HKMA employees annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) for the recommendations of its Governance Sub-Committee (GSC). The review considers the GSC’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a financial sector salary survey conducted by an independent human resources consulting firm, and other relevant factors. Salaries of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be subject to special adjustments to serve as a reward and maintain their salary competitiveness.\n\nThe HKMA allocates approved funds for adjusting annual fixed pay and variable pay based on individual employees' performance; the variable pay system for employees responsible for investments aims to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. For employees at the level of Assistant Chief Executive and above, adjustments to fixed pay and the issuance of variable pay are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Sub-Committee, and these employees will not attend meetings discussing salary proposals. For employees at the level of Director and below, the Chief Executive of the HKMA decides on adjustments to fixed pay and the issuance of variable pay based on the Financial Secretary's authorization, using the approved total amount for salary payments.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n","terms":{"10年期美國國債收益率":["Ten-year

The HKMA fulfills this commitment across various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets, caring for the broader society, protecting the environment, and creating a friendly work environment.\n\nTo address the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA introduced a number of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping the Hong Kong economy weather the crisis.\n\n# MarketEnvironment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks affecting human well-being and the sustainability of the world economy. As an important part of society, the financial sector is also inevitably affected. Banks, as part of the financial sector, should be more proactive in managing climate risks. In light of this, the HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge and is implementing a number of measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include a three-phased approach to advancing the development of green and sustainable banking:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablish a common assessment framework with the industry to evaluate the current \"Greenness Baseline\" of banks, as well as collaborate with international organisations to provide technical support to Hong Kong's banks.\n\n# Phase Two\n\nConsult with the industry and other stakeholders regarding supervisory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\n\n# Third Stage\n\nFocus on monitoring and evaluation of the banks' progress in this area.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA participates in multiple international organisations, including the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Interest Group on Sustainable Finance under the Working Group on Banking Supervision of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. Through participation in these international organisations, the HKMA has the opportunity to contribute to the efforts of the central banking and regulatory community in addressing climate change, and can draw on the experiences and perspectives of other regions when developing local frameworks.\n\nThe HKMA is also participating in multiple workstreams under the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), including the microprudential and supervision workstream (WS1), the macrofinancial workstream (WS2), and the scaling up green finance workstream (WS3). In addition, the HKMA has joined two newly established workstreams: the workstream on research and the workstream on bridging the data gap. The workstream on research is responsible for conducting relevant studies, while the workstream on bridging the data gap aims to develop a comprehensive list of data items required by regulatory authorities and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, which are currently not available. Details of the HKMA's efforts in promoting green and sustainable banking during the year are outlined in the Banking Stability chapter.\n\nThe HKMA, in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), launched the Alliance for Green Commercial Banks in November to assist banks in emerging markets in developing strategies to address climate change. As a founding member and the first regional anchor of the alliance, the HKMA i) promotes the development of Green Commercial Banks in global financial markets; ii) provides a peer-to-peer learning platform for commercial banks to acquire the necessary knowledge, tools, and business information to develop their own green finance road maps and transform into credible Green Commercial Banks; iii) facilitates communication and explores cutting-edge issues to advance the global green finance agenda; and iv) supports collaboration among alliance members and helps seize the estimated USD 23 trillion in emerging market green and climate-related investment opportunities identified by the IFC over the next decade.\n\nLocally, the HKMA collaborates with other financial regulators to coordinate measures within the financial sector to address climate and environmental risks. In addition to assisting the government in implementing the Government Green Bond Programme, the HKMA jointly initiated the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (Steering Group) with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to handle cross-sectoral regulatory and market development matters. Details on the HKMA's work this year in developing Hong Kong into a green and sustainable finance hub are set out in the International Financial Centre chapter.\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group\n\nThe Steering Group aims to coordinate the financial sector's measures to address climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government's climate strategy. The Steering Group was jointly established by the HKMA and the SFC in May, with other members including the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its establishment, the steering group has set up two work streams: one responsible for researching and handling cross-departmental regulatory matters, and the other for coordinating cross-agency market development efforts.\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nAll translations correctly use \"work streams\" for \"技術工作專責團隊\" as required. The term \"steering group\" (used in translations 1, 3, 6) is more precise than \"oversight group\" or \"supervisory group\" for \"督導小組,\" as \"steering\" implies guidance and direction, aligning with the supervisory role. \"Cross-agency\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is preferable to \"cross-organizational\" or \"cross-institutional\" for \"跨機構,\" as it directly references inter-agency collaboration. The parallel structure \"one responsible for... and the other for...\" (translations 1, 3, 5) is clearer than \"responsible for... as well as...\" (translation 4). \"Efforts\" (translations 1, 3, 6) better captures the active nature of \"工作\" in \"市場發展工作\" than \"activities\" or \"work.\" \"Set up\" (translations 3, 6) is more natural in this context than \"established\" or \"set up.\" The final translation integrates these strengths for clarity and fluency.\n\nThe steering committee released the Green and sustainable finance strategy in December, proposing to strengthen Hong Kong's financial ecosystem in six areas to build a greener and more sustainable future in the long term. The steering committee also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues in the development process.\n\nThe HKMA held the inaugural meeting of its supervisory committee, with Eddie Yue, HKMA Chief Executive (third from the right), serving as co-chair of the committee.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations vary in formality, terminology, and clarity. Key considerations:  \n1. **\"督導小組\"** – \"supervisory group\" (used in translations 3–6) is less formal than \"supervisory committee\" (used in translations 1–2), which better reflects the official nature of the body.  \n2. **\"聯席主席\"** – \"co-chair\" (translations 1–2) is more natural in English than \"co-chairman\" (translations 3–6), which feels archaic.  \n3. **\"右三\"** – \"third from the right\" (translations 2, 5, 6) is clearer than \"right three\" (translations 1, 3, 4).  \n4. **Title consistency** – \"HKMA Chief Executive\" (translations 1–2) is preferable to \"Chief Executive of the HKMA\" (translations 3–6) for brevity and alignment with official titles.  \n5. **Fluency** – The second translation balances precision and natural phrasing, while others occasionally use awkward structures (e.g., \"held a meeting to establish a supervisory group\").  \nThe optimal translation integrates the most accurate terminology, natural phrasing, and cultural appropriateness.\n\nThe steering group released Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance strategic plan and five key action plans.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA supports responsible investment, which involves integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment activities. As a major asset owner, the HKMA is increasingly focused on responsible investment, which will influence how its asset managers conduct their investment activities.\n\n# HKMA beliefs\n\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing Responsible Investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it will more effectively achieve The Exchange Fund's investment objectives and reduce ESG-related risks involved in investment activities.\n\n# HKMA's Principles\n\nAccording to the guiding principles adopted by the HKMA, ESG investments are generally prioritized when their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable to those of other investment projects. As a responsible long-term investor, the HKMA incorporates the Principles for Responsible Investment into its investment management process, adapting them according to circumstances.\n\n# Integrate into\n\nThe HKMA believes that ESG factors will have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects, and therefore integrates ESG factors into its investment analysis process to identify risks and uncover opportunities. The HKMA integrates ESG factors into the management of public and private market investments.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA appropriately exercises shareholder rights over its public equity holdings to maintain the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour, taking into account ESG factors, will help create long-term shareholder value. The HKMA expects external fund managers to actively exercise ownership by exercising voting rights and engaging with investee companies, thereby assisting the HKMA in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over investment portfolios.\n\n# Cooperation.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to collaborating with like-minded investors and regulatory authorities to promote sound long-term investment management practices. It also participates in public events and delivers speeches to share improved ESG practices and encourage the investment community to adopt Responsible Investment principles.\n\nFor details on the HKMA's work on Responsible Investment this year, see the Reserves Management chapter.\n\n# HKMA, as an active responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of external fund managers.\n\n# HKMA's Expectations\n\nThe HKMA places great emphasis on integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and the concept of Active ownership. To this end, the HKMA considers ESG factors when selecting, appointing, and monitoring external fund managers. Since the HKMA believes that exercising shareholder rights over its public equity holdings is a fundamental principle for safeguarding the long-term value of its investments, it requires appointed external fund managers to take Active ownership seriously.\n\n# HKMA's Supervision\n\nExternal fund managers must be assessed on the ESG performance of the listed equity portfolios they manage for the HKMA. The HKMA systematically reviews the ESG practices of external fund managers across various areas through its communication plan, such as their ESG assessment framework, communication with investee companies, and work related to proxy voting. In 2020, the HKMA selected several external fund managers to pilot the communication plan, which not only assessed their ESG performance but also examined whether they properly exercised asset ownership on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication Outcomes\n\nThe HKMA identifies external fund managers with problematic operational practices through the program and takes follow-up actions. The following are two examples.\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe HKMA noted that equity securities investment manager A's ESG framework has room for improvement, particularly in establishing a more systematic approach to assess investee companies. The HKMA followed up with A on this matter, after which A conducted a comprehensive review of its corporate policies to implement a more robust ESG framework. A also specifically engaged an external consultant to provide input on ESG procedures, reflecting its determination to accelerate the implementation of reforms. Additionally, A established a new ESG committee composed of senior management, demonstrating its commitment to ESG and the support of senior management for these measures.\n\n# Case 2\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate and fluent, with minor variations in phrasing and structure. All dictionary terms are correctly translated, and the core message is preserved. However, improvements can be made in terms of naturalness, precision, and stylistic consistency. Key observations:\n1. **\"Voting methods\" vs. \"voting practices\"**: While \"voting methods\" is technically correct, \"voting practices\" is more natural in financial contexts, as it implies the actual process and behavior rather than abstract techniques.\n2. **\"Requested its Head of ESG to conduct a review\" vs. \"requested that the Head of ESG conduct a review\"**: The latter is more formal and grammatically precise, avoiding the possessive \"its\" which may imply ownership of the ESG role.\n3. **\"Fully supported all management recommendations\" vs. \"voted in favor of all management proposals\"**: The latter is more direct and aligns better with the original text's emphasis on voting actions.\n4. **\"Potentially voting against management\" vs. \"possibly voting against management\"**: \"Potentially\" is slightly more formal and better suited to regulatory contexts.\n5. **Redundancy in \"which included\" vs. \"including\"**: The latter is more concise and avoids unnecessary clauses.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nFollowing a review of equity securities investment manager B’s voting practices, the HKMA found that B’s voting policy had shortcomings in multiple areas and requested that its Head of ESG conduct a review. In particular, B had previously voted in favor of all management proposals, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently committed to strengthening its voting policy to meet expectations, including increasing the involvement of ESG team members and potentially voting against management in cases involving significant governance issues.\n\nIn the private equity market, the HKMA, through its general partners (GPs), collaborates with relevant portfolio companies on ESG matters to achieve Responsible Investment. The HKMA has noted that GPs consistently uphold their commitment to ESG, as they believe this approach helps create long-term value for portfolio companies and ensures the sustainability of returns. The following two examples demonstrate how climate change risks can be managed through (i) design modifications and the use of innovative operational technologies; and (ii) incorporating carbon reduction factors into the construction and operation of green and sustainable warehouses. Both examples have a significant positive impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions, avoiding harmful substances, and simultaneously improving operational efficiency through cost reduction and energy savings.\n\nThe HKMA has invested in a pest control company that adopts environmentally friendly solutions. Although traditional pesticides and chemical products can effectively kill pests, failure to promptly remove or properly dispose of dead pests can pose a threat to public health. Furthermore, leakage and disposal of chemical components can cause environmental problems. The company's solution, which does not contain biocides, reduces the use of harmful chemicals by installing insect traps. The company also utilizes internet-connected dynamic sensors to remotely detect whether pests have been captured. With this new technology, the company can make optimized route planning to collect the captured pests, reducing travel mileage and thereby lowering carbon emissions. The company's approach results in a net carbon emission level of 0.36 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of net sales, a low level approaching the average for low-carbon-emitting sectors such as legal services and software publishing, which is indeed encouraging.\n\n(ii) The HKMA has invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the relevant warehouse developers have adopted a net zero carbon process in their overall warehouse construction and operations, establishing standards and metrics to measure net zero carbon benchmarks. The building plans also take into account the sustainability of the materials and components used. As a result, the constructed warehouses are carbon-efficient and feature sustainable characteristics, including solar thermal systems, electric vehicle charging portals, natural daylighting, and rainwater harvesting.\n\nAccording to an independent consultant’s assessment, the carbon footprint of the warehouse construction, on a net basis, is 25.8% lower than that of a typical logistics building. To further offset the carbon emissions generated by the construction project, 32,799 trees were planted during the building process (on a net basis). Once completed, the warehouse’s daily operational carbon emissions are 26.9% lower than those of a typical warehouse.\n"}

These financial statements include THE EXCHANGE FUND and the Group's balance sheets as of December 31, 2020, and the income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements accurately and fairly reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2020, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date. They have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission's auditing standards. My responsibilities under these standards are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, are the most significant matters in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. I addressed these matters in the course of my audit of, and in forming my opinion on, the financial statements, and I will not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other information. This other information includes all information in the Monetary Authority's 2020 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on other information.  \nThe junior translations all correctly use \"financial statements\" as required by the dictionary. However, several issues persist:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Attestation conclusion\" is less precise than \"assurance conclusion\" in auditing\/financial contexts. \"Assurance\" is the standard term for professional conclusions in this domain.  \n2. **Redundancy**: Repeating \"other information\" twice (e.g., \"any other information\" and \"on any other information\") is unnecessary and disrupts fluency.  \n3. **Verb Choice**: \"Provide\" (used in Translation 4) is less formal than \"express,\" which better matches the tone of professional statements.  \n4. **Word Choice**: \"Data\" (Translation 6) is overly narrow compared to \"information,\" which aligns better with the general term \"資料\" in the original text.  \nThe optimal translation balances precision, conciseness, and professional tone by using \"assurance conclusion\" and avoiding redundancy.\n\nWith respect to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the circumstances I became aware of during the audit process, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no such report.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Sub-Committee under the Monetary Authority and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls it considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority must assess the group's ability to continue as a going concern and, where applicable, disclose matters related to the going concern, and use the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole do not contain any material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Audit Commission audit standards will necessarily detect any existing material misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they will be considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's audit standards, I apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I also:  \n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;  \n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether its accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;  \n- Determine whether the Monetary Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may result in the Group's inability to continue as a going concern;  \n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events; and  \n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters relating to the audit scope and timing, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal control identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and disclosing all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be seen as affecting my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the current period, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor’s report, unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public Disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, because a reasonable expectation exists that communicating a matter in my report would result in negative consequences that outweigh the public interest it would serve, and I decide not to communicate that matter in the report.\n\nDirector of Audit Zhu Nai Zhang\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\n# 1 Principal Activities\n\nThe Monetary Authority manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66), under the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as the Fund's manager. The Fund's principal activities are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency and maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe fund's assets are managed across four distinct portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Portfolio. Under Hong Kong's Currency Board system, the assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and equity markets of OECD member countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds equity securities of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which were purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for strategic purposes and are included in the fund's accounts. Operating segment information is presented in Note 32.\n\n# 2 Main Accounting Policies\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which constitute a comprehensive framework encompassing all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards, and interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), as well as generally accepted accounting principles. A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the fund and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Group\") is set out below.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued several new or revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which became effective for the first time in the Group's current accounting period or were available for early adoption. Changes in accounting policies resulting from the Group's first-time adoption of applicable standards in the current and prior accounting periods (if any) are reflected in these financial statements, with related information disclosed in Note 3.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements\n\nThe group financial statements include the group's financial statements, as well as the group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the major subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures are set out in Notes 17 and 18.\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities measured at fair value:  \n- Derivative financial instruments (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (Note 2.6);  \n- Gold (Note 2.10); and  \n- Investment properties (Note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions, which affect the adoption of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. These estimates and related assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered appropriate in the circumstances. In the absence of other readily available data, these estimates and assumptions are used as the basis for determining the carrying amounts of relevant assets and liabilities, and the estimated results may differ from their actual values.\n\nThese estimates and related assumptions will be subject to ongoing review and revision. If the revisions affect only the current accounting period, they will be recognized within that period. However, if the revisions affect both the current period and future accounting periods, they will be recognized in the current period and in future periods accordingly.\n\nThe main sources of uncertainty in management's significant judgments and estimates regarding the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which have a major impact on the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.19.\n\nCertain 2019 comparative figures have been reclassified to align with the presentation format of this year's financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and Non-Controlling Interests\n\nSubsidiaries refer to entities controlled by the group. The group is deemed to have control over an entity if it bears the risk of variable returns or enjoys related rights arising from its involvement in the entity’s operations, and has the ability to exercise power over the entity to affect those returns. When assessing whether the group has power, only the substantive rights held by the group and other parties are considered.\n"}
