{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and initiatives.","zh":"# 2023 年亮點\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境嚴峻，香港經濟在2023年實現正面增長，主要由入境旅遊及內需復甦推動。隨經濟復甦，勞動市場持續改善，通脹則保持溫和。預計2024年的經濟活動將進一步以溫和步伐復甦，但前景因多重外部不確定因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n香港銀行業在2023年依然穩健，受益於強勁的資本及流動性緩衝。資產質素維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將「長期維持高位」的背景下，2023年港元大部分時間交易於聯繫匯率制度的弱方兌換區間內，自二月中至五月初期間，弱方兌換擔保機制共被觸發八次。港元匯兌及貨幣市場保持穩定，並持續以順暢有序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年是聯繫匯率制度實施四十週年。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度在過去四十年間協助香港度過一連串衝擊與危機，充分展現了這項制度的韌性與穩健性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速應對三月份美國及歐洲的銀行危機，從管理其餘波至完成內部檢討，為本地銀行業總結經驗教訓，同時持續關注銀行的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理。鑑於網絡安全威脅日益升級，以及銀行對第三方技術服務的依賴不斷增加，香港金融管理局亦與銀行密切合作，以提升其營運及網絡安全韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局透過進一步修訂《銀行業行為守則》及《反詐騙消費者保護守則》，加強支付卡消費者的保障。金管局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化專業投資者的銷售流程，推出「跨境財富管理互聯互通試點計劃」的增強措施，並開始監管信託業務。此外，亦啟動「信貸數據智通」下的消費者信貸資料服務試點計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資方面的努力，體現了其在風險為本策略下針對最高威脅的承諾。為應對日益增加的數字詐騙問題，香港金融管理局透過推出即時詐欺監測、加強銀行與執法機構之間的信息共享、加強公眾教育，以及在使用快速支付系統時推出新的交易前警報機制，來強化生態系統合作。同時，監管科技能力亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃得到提升。\n\n香港金融管理局在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率及信息披露等，並在加強銀行業能力建設方面作出顯著努力。\n\n香港金融管理局亦積極推進相關工作，以確保可信的處置機制，包括制定新的處置標準以接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施，以及完成對吸收虧損能力政策標準實施情況的審查。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第二屆全球金融領袖投資峰會及香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行高層會議的成功圓滿結束，體現了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港的相關機構密切合作，以深化和拓展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。這包括優化「跨境財富管理互聯互通計劃」、為「債券通」南向交易指定更多做市商、成功啟動「互換通」北向交易，以及推行港幣人民幣雙櫃檯模式及雙櫃檯做市商計劃，所有這些措施均有助鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n在提升香港金融平台競爭力方面，債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色與可持續金融以及企業財務中心等領域已取得顯著進展。\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \n1. **Translation Quality & Fluency:**  \n   - All translations accurately convey the core meaning, but vary in fluency. The first and third translations use \"提升\" and \"強化\" respectively, both acceptable, though \"強化\" slightly emphasizes intensity. The fourth translation adds \"多個領域\" (multiple areas), which is redundant given \"等領域\" already implies plurality.  \n   - The fifth translation uses \"可持續融資\" (sustainable financing) instead of \"可持續金融\" (sustainable finance), which misrepresents the original term. \"金融\" is more precise here.  \n   - The sixth translation uses \"企業資金庫中心\" (corporate treasury centres), but \"資金庫\" (treasury) is less standard than \"財務中心\" (treasury centre) in financial contexts.  \n2. **Grammar & Vocabulary:**  \n   - Most translations use \"取得顯著進展\" (made notable progress), which is natural. However, the second and third translations use \"已取得\" (have already made), which slightly alters the nuance of the original \"notable progress is made\" (passive voice).  \n   - The term \"財富管理\" (wealth management) is consistently translated correctly.  \n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:**  \n   - All translations are culturally appropriate for Hong Kong’s financial context. However, \"企業財務中心\" (corporate treasury centres) is more standard than \"資金庫中心\" (treasury centres), as \"財務\" aligns with common financial terminology in Chinese.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Use \"強化\" for \"strengthening\" to emphasize proactive measures.  \n- Replace \"資金庫中心\" with \"財務中心\" for accuracy.  \n- Retain \"可持續金融\" to match the original term.  \n- Avoid redundancy by omitting \"多個領域.\"  \n- Use \"已取得\" to reflect completed progress, aligning with the original passive construction.  \n**Final Translation:**  \n在強化香港金融平台競爭力方面，債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色與可持續金融以及企業財務中心等領域已取得顯著進展。\n\n香港金融管理局持續在「金融科技2025」策略的各個方面取得重大進展。mBridge項目已進入最小可行產品開發階段，電子港元試點計劃第一階段已完成，商業數據交換平台的使用量不斷增加，並成功與政府數據來源連結。此外，金管局亦公布新的金融科技推廣路線圖，進一步推動銀行業發展財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式賬本技術。同時，快速支付系統迎來五週年，持續擴展應用範圍並增強功能，包括新增與泰國PromptPay連結以進行跨境QR碼支付等功能。在穩定幣發行機構監管框架的制定方面亦取得顯著進展，並已發布公開諮詢文件，以徵求各界對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 準備金管理\n\n儘管投資環境波動且充滿挑戰，外匯基金仍成功取得2260億港元的可觀投資收入，投資回報率達5.5%。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推動資產多元化及負責任投資。同時，長期增長投資組合自2009年成立以來，年化內部收益率為11.8%。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過不同渠道與社會各界及市場保持密切溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的理解。\n\n香港金融管理局致力於建立一支敏捷專業的工作團隊，維持嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升數字化能力，以適應變革，確保政策及措施的有效落實。"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:\n","zh":"# 2024年及以後的優先事項\n\n踏入2024年，香港經濟預期將繼續以溫和步伐復甦，主要得益於入境旅遊業的持續復興、公共基礎設施項目的推進，以及私人消費的穩定。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不確定性，特別是與美國未來政策利率路徑、全球經濟增長前景，以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢相關的因素。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性及多年累積的充足緩衝機制，仍具備有效應對不利衝擊的良好基礎。\n\n香港金融管理局非常重視維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將密切關注不確定的宏觀經濟環境，努力及時識別新興風險，並以靈活的方式作出回應。同時，我們將尋找機會，創造政策彈性，以進一步提升香港作為國際金融中心的地位。在這個充滿挑戰的投資環境中管理外匯基金時，我們將繼續審慎投資，保持靈活性，適時採取防禦性措施，並維持高度流動性。\n\n#金融體系的穩定性與健全性\n\n近幾年全球經濟的不確定性預計將持續至2024年。香港金融管理局將密切關注最新發展，保持警覺以應對潛在風險，以維護金融體系的韌性與穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警覺\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景的不確定性、地緣政治風險的演變，以及全球經濟復甦步伐不均等因素而出現波動。2024年亦是重要選舉年，世界各地將舉行多場重大選舉，這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性及多年累積的緩衝能力，已具備充分準備以應對不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦擁有足夠的能力、資源及決心，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續密切監察本地及外部環境中出現的風險及弱點，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦將就影響香港經濟的問題進行研究，評估並應對與這些問題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行體系穩定\n\n2023年，全球各地爆發新的地緣政治緊張局勢，而部分舊有爭議仍未解決，導致政治不確定性與不穩定性持續延燒，預計將延續至2024年。高利率所帶來的經濟壓力成為全球經濟環境的顯著特徵，且進入2024年時利率仍維持高位。在銀行業方面，持續推動數位化及應用新技術，包括人工智能，雖然帶來許多優勢，但也同時衍生新的營運風險、網絡安全威脅及監管挑戰。面對如此動盪的政治、經濟與科技環境，香港金融管理局致力透過持續的監管措施，確保銀行系統具備抵禦衝擊的能力。同時，我們將持續優化與完善銀行監管框架及政策，充分考量科技發展、客戶期望的演變，以及國際標準與最佳實務。\n\n# 基於風險的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險、流動性風險及市場風險\n\n鑑於宏觀經濟環境日益嚴峻，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將特別關注監測認可機構（AIs）的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理及控制措施的有效性，尤其在貸款分類、提備及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行及商業界保持密切溝通，以確保認可機構在經濟週期內，能在審慎進行信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡。特別是，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟進銀行於2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行獲得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不確定性以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇，可能增加資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金管局將以保持警覺為首要任務，並持續有效監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 後續行動：從2023年銀行動盪中汲取的教訓\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將落實其為應對2023年美國及歐洲銀行動盪而進行的內部檢討中所識別的後續措施。這些措施旨在進一步強化監管成效，並提升其應對銀行危機的能力。具體包括：在HKMA的監管審查過程中加強對認可機構（AIs）銀行賬簿利率風險的風險捕捉；鑒於銀行服務持續數碼化，提升認可機構應對流動性壓力的準備；簡化HKMA的危機管理程序；以及進一步加強跨機構及跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續監察認可機構在達成完全符合香港金融管理局監管政策手冊（SPM）模組 OR-2「營運韌性」方面的進展，並評估及對標銀行對可合理預見中斷的容忍度，以提升整體銀行體系的韌性。關於網絡風險，我們將監督認可機構根據《網絡韌性評估框架 2.0》進行新一輪自我評估，並監察其實施安全的三級數據備份，以提升在面對破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑒於銀行業務數字化進程不斷加快，香港金融管理局將密切關注使用生成式人工智慧及分布式賬本技術等先進技術所引致的新興風險。我們亦會與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，運作靈活且具預見性的機制，以應對日益增長的數字詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n為維護銀行體系的完整性並建立客戶信心，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2024年將針對高風險領域，優先推動以風險為本的監管更新，包括發佈指引以支持有效落實對政治高風險人士的監管要求變更，以及支持穩定幣發行機構監管制度的實施。我們亦將發佈指引，協助人工智能優化其交易監測系統，並促進人工智能的負責任使用，並透過主題性工作，專注於針對高階洗錢活動的控制措施。為加強對數字詐騙的生態系統應對，並減少對受害者的損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾及業界，就擴展銀行間資訊共享範圍，從企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶的建議進行磋商，並根據所接獲的意見，推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過整合多家銀行與反洗錢相關的數據，並與現有生態系統的詐騙分析系統進行對接，全面建設Macro Analytics 3.0。這將帶來更快的跨銀行應對措施，進一步強化我們以數據驅動的反洗錢及反恐融資監管，使我們能夠更快、更有效地應對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險。\n\n#財富管理及強積金相關業務\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將加強對持牌機構在財富管理及證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務方面的現場檢查及非現場監測。具體而言，我們將重點關注跨境財富管理通（Cross-boundary WMC）業務、數字分銷及顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，並兼顧最新市場發展及不斷演進的國際標準。\n\n香港金融管理局將與其他監管機構及銀行業界密切溝通，適時就投資、保險及強積金產品銷售的監管標準提供指引。特別是為支持虛擬資產行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保現行針對虛擬資產行業的監管制度穩健、全面且平衡。\n\n香港金融管理局將促進並監督業界落實跨境WMC的改進措施，並持續與業界及相關監管當局協調，以進一步完善該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並適時整合及明確指引，以協助業界遵守相關規定。除信託業務外，我們亦將開始根據《證券及期貨條例》監管為證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）授權的集體投資計劃提供保管服務的自動投資平台（AI）所涉及的新第13類受規管活動，該監管安排將於2024年10月2日生效。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局旨在根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）所發出的各項指引，促進其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全與效率。我們將持續參與CPMI-IOSCO1的PFMI實施監測與評估工作，並參與其他國際工作小組，就新興及創新性的FMIs相關倡議的落實情況進行討論。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並適時檢討及加強監管要求，以反映最新的國際實務以及市場與科技的發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將持續加強和完善其銀行監管框架及政策，並考慮國際標準及最佳實踐。\n\n# 香港落實巴塞爾標準\n\n有關實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案（最終方案）的《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR）擬議修訂，預計在立法會通過後，將於2025年1月1日生效。2024年，香港金融管理局將繼續準備支持規則實施所需的指引、銀行報表及標準披露範本與表格。具體而言，我們計劃：  \n- 於2024年第二季就SPM模組CA-B-3「逆週期資本緩衝（CCyB）－私人部門信貸風險地理分配」及報表MA(BS)25「逆週期資本緩衝季度報告」的修訂徵詢業界意見，反映因實施最終方案及修訂國際銀行統計報表所引致的後續變更；以及  \n- 完成有關新市場及信貸估值調整風險標準僅需報告要求的套件，該要求將於2024年7月1日開始實施。\n\n銀行業（風險敞口限制）規則（BELR）及銀行業（流動性）規則（BLR）的擬議修訂中，主要為配合修訂後銀行業（資本）規則（BCR）下最終方案的實施而產生的後續性條文，亦預計於2025年1月1日生效。香港金融管理局（HKMA）計劃於2024年完成相關監管報表的後續性修訂。\n\n同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會分別於2022年12月及2023年12月發布了關於銀行加密資產敞口審慎處理的新標準及後續針對性修訂，預計本地將於2025年實施該標準。香港金融管理局將檢討是否需對多項規則，包括銀行資本規則（BCR）、銀行流動性規則（BDR）、銀行信貸風險暴露規則（BELR）及銀行流動性風險規則（BLR），進行潛在的立法修訂，並於2025年上半年就相關規則修訂展開法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n香港金融管理局計劃根據2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行危機所帶來的教訓，以及監管要求及國際標準的發展情況，更新若干SPM模組。這些模組包括：\n"}
{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003.

The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","zh":"# 關於香港金融管理局\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構。香港金融管理局有四大主要職能：\n- 在聯繫匯率制度的框架內維持貨幣穩定；\n- 促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與完整性；\n- 協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，包括維護及發展香港的金融基礎設施；以及\n- 管理外匯基金。\n\n# 香港金融管理局的法定職責\n\n香港金融管理局於一九九三年四月一日成立，此係立法會於一九九二年通過《外匯基金條例》修正案，賦予財政司司長任命貨幣管理機構權力後實現。\n\n貨幣管理局的權力、職能及責任載於《外匯基金條例》、《銀行條例》、《金融機構（解決）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值設施條例》及其他相關條例。財政司司長與貨幣管理局在貨幣及金融事務上的職能及責任劃分，載於2003年6月25日的函件往來。該函件往來披露財政司司長授予貨幣管理局的授權。有關函件為公眾文件，可於香港金融管理局網站查閱。\n\n《外匯基金條例》設立外匯基金，由財政司司長掌管。根據條例，基金主要用於影響港元匯率。在顧及其主要用途的同時，基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n貨幣管理局根據《外匯基金條例》設立，其職責是協助財政司司長履行根據該條例所賦予的職能，並執行其他由其他條例或財政司司長指派的職能。貨幣管理局的機構稱為香港金融管理局（HKMA），而貨幣管理局為香港金融管理局的行政總裁。\n\n《銀行條例》賦予貨幣當局監管及監督銀行業務及吸收存款業務的責任與權力。根據該條例，貨幣當局負責香港持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司的發牌事宜。\n\n《金融機構（解決）條例》規定，貨幣當局為銀行業實體的解決當局。貨幣當局擁有廣泛權力，以有序方式解決非可行銀行業實體（其失敗可能構成系統性風險）。其目的是維持金融穩定，同時致力保護公帑。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予貨幣當局就銀行的證券業務及強制性公積金業務的某些權力。\n\n根據《保險條例》，保險業監管局已授權金管局就銀行從事的保險相關業務行使檢查及調查權力。\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資條例》賦予貨幣當局權力，以監督銀行遵守條例所規定的客戶盡職調查及記錄保存要求。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》賦予貨幣當局責任，協助運作存款保障計劃，並在持牌銀行倒閉時，啟動存款保障計劃基金向存款人支付賠償。\n\n《支付系統及儲值設施條例》為金融管理局提供法定制度，以指定及監管在香港運作的某些重要清算及結算系統和零售支付系統。該條例亦賦權金融管理局管理一套發牌制度，以規管用作儲存貨幣價值並符合條例所訂明標準的電子及實體「儲值設施」。"}
{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管面對嚴峻的外部環境，香港經濟在2023年仍實現正面增長，得益於入境旅遊及內需的復甦。隨著經濟復甦，勞動市場持續改善，而通脹則維持溫和。在金融條件趨緊及市場情緒偏弱下，資產市場依然疲軟。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，但前景因多項外部不確定因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n#經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n經歷了去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟在2023年實現穩步增長，增幅為3.2%（見表1及圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在勞動市場情況改善及政府推出多項支持措施（如消費券計劃及一系列促銷活動）的推動下顯著回升。儘管金融條件趨緊，整體投資支出仍因較去年同期低基數而實現顯著增長。外部因素方面，香港的服務出口因入境旅遊業強勁復甦而反彈。然而，這項正面影響被出境旅遊的強勁復甦所抵消，出境旅遊以服務進口計。另一方面，面對疲弱的外需，貨物出口持續低迷，拖累香港的本地生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖表 1 實際國內生產總值增長按貢獻分項  \n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處\n\n表1 按支出項目計算的實際國內生產總值增長（環比）  \n註：經季節調整後的固定資本形成總額季度對季度變動率數據不可得。  \n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2023年當地通貨膨脹維持溫和，因外在價格壓力逐漸緩和，而國內成本壓力雖隨經濟復甦略有上升，但整體仍大致受控（圖2）¹。2023年全年，核心通貨膨脹率與整體通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%與2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2023年勞動市場情況進一步改善，失業率於7月降至十年來最低水平2.8%，其後數月均維持在低水平（圖3）。勞動需求與勞動供給同時增加，分別反映於總就業人數的回升（圖3）及勞動力人數的增加。鑒於香港人力短缺，政府於2023年推出多項勞工輸入計劃及人才吸引措施。同時，因勞動市場供不應求，名義工資及勞動收入的年同比增長率逐步回升至疫情前水平。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況  \n資料來源：人口普查及統計處\n\n# 股票市場\n\n在2023年初趨於穩定後，本地股市在下半年表現疲軟。恆生指數延續2022年底的反彈勢頭，於2023年1月27日收報22,689點，創下年度新高。其後指數回落，並進一步下滑至12月的低位（見圖表4），反映出市場情緒受美國及瑞士3月銀行業問題、全球經濟前景較弱以及下半年金融環境趨於緊縮等因素拖累。恆生指數全年收市報17,047點，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，連續第四年錄得下跌。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2023年前四個月，住宅物業市場因內地及香港恢復正常而出現反彈，但隨後因按揭利率上漲及市場情緒低迷而走軟。整體而言，2023年樓價按年下跌6.9%，房屋交易量進一步下降4.5%，創歷史新低，僅錄得43,002宗。儘管樓價下調使住房負擔能力略有改善，但整體仍處於緊張狀態。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面臨壓力，寫字樓、零售舖位及廠房物業價格進一步下跌。寫字樓租金因空置率高企及居家辦公安排普及導致供應過剩而持續承壓。另一方面，零售舖位租金則因入境旅遊復甦及私人消費改善而有所上升。\n\n圖表4 資產價格  \n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易所及結算所有限公司\n\n#經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2024年香港經濟將以溫和步伐持續復甦。入境旅遊業將隨著接待能力的持續提升及政府推動大型活動的措施而進一步擴展，同時穩定的勞動市場亦應會支持本地消費活動。政府將推進的各項基礎設施項目亦將為經濟提供支持。此外，香港出口商品將與全球科技週期預期回升同步穩定。政府預計實質GDP將穩步增長2.5%至3.5%。然而，展望受多重風險與不確定性影響，包括源自美國政策利率路徑、科技週期復甦速度、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷升級的地緣政治緊張局勢等因素。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2024年本地通貨膨脹將保持溫和，因外部價格壓力減緩，有助於抵消經濟進一步復甦及住宅租金上漲所帶來的國內成本上漲壓力。市場共識預測2024年整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預計整體通脹率與核心通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，持續的經濟復甦將支撐就業市場，各項勞動力輸入及人才吸引方案亦將持續緩解各行業的人力短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面臨多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、美國及歐洲三月銀行危機引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及內地與香港經濟復甦速度未如預期。儘管面對這些多重壓力，香港銀行業仍保持穩健，並持續受益於強勁的資本及流動性緩衝。即使不良貸款比率有所上升，銀行業的資產質素仍保持健康。銀行盈利能力顯著改善，主要得益於淨利息收入增加。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n截至2023年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至1.56%，其中逾期及重組貸款比率亦由同期的0.85%增至1.24%（見圖表5）。與內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率亦由去年同期的2.26%上升至2023年底的2.58%。分類貸款比率的上升主要歸因於對內地房地產開發商風險敞口的評級下調。儘管如此，銀行所提列的撥備仍屬充足。截至2023年底，撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與分類貸款的比率）為75%。若將分類貸款所擔保的抵押品市場價值納入考量，調整後的撥備覆蓋率將達約145%。同時，截至2023年底，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的逾期貸款比率分別為0.08%及0.30%，仍處於低位（見圖表6）。\n\n圖表5 銀行業資產質素  \n註：數據涵蓋香港辦事處、海外分行及主要海外子公司。  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局（HKMA）\n\n圖6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n2023年銀行業錄得顯著的利潤增長。零售銀行的稅前營業利潤年增62.1%，同期稅後平均資產回報率由0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。利潤改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加30%，以及2023年交易性投資實現顯著收益，與前一年的輕微虧損形成鮮明對比。然而，貸款減值費用增加28%（因針對新分類貸款提列特定準備金）部分抵消了上述增長。在利率上漲的背景下，零售銀行的淨息差從一年前的1.31%擴大至2023年的1.68%（圖8）。同時，零售銀行的成本收入比從2022年的48.0%下降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7 零售銀行表現  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖8 零售銀行的淨息差  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖9 零售銀行的成本收入比 資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n2023年銀行業資產負債表增長0.9%，主要由於持有的可轉讓債務工具（+8.6%）及銀行間拆借（+4.4%）的增長，大致抵消了總貸款的下降。鑒於貸款需求低迷、借貸成本上升及全球經濟前景疲弱，2023年總貸款下降3.6%。其中，用於香港的貸款大致穩定（-0.4%），而用於香港以外地區的貸款及貿易融資貸款則分別下降10.4%及13.1%。與內地相關的貸款在2023年下降6.6%。\n\n在負債方面，2023年總存款增長5.1%，較2022年的1.7%顯著提升。由於總貸款減少而總存款增加，截至2023年底，整體貸款佔存款比率由一年前的68.5%降至62.8%（見圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業於2023年保持充足的資本。截至2023年底，本地註冊授權機構（AIs）的合併總資本比率為21.1%，較前一年的20.1%有所提高。一級資本比率為18.9%（圖11）。兩項比率均遠高於各自對應的國際最低要求。截至2023年底，巴塞爾協議III的槓桿比率為7.9%（圖12）。\n\n圖表10 銀行業貸款及存款 資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表11 本地註冊授權機構的合併資本比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表12 本地註冊授權機構合併槓桿比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行業持續保持強勁的流動性狀況。2023年第四季，第一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為178.6%，第二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為65.7%（圖13）。銀行業的主要資金來源仍為客戶存款。截至2023年底，第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）與第二類A機構的核心資金比率（CFR）分別為144.4%和169.4%（圖14）。四項比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖13 指定授權機構的流動性比率 資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖14 指定機構的資金比率  \n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n","zh":"#貨幣穩定性\n\n2023年，在市場預期美國政策利率將維持「高位較久」的背景下，港元主要交易於聯繫匯率制度的弱方兌換承諾範圍內，自2月中旬至5月初，弱方兌換承諾共被觸發八次。自5月起，港元恢復部分動能，年底時交易於7.8的中間價附近。在2023年慶祝聯繫匯率制度實施40週年的背景下，香港銀行同業拆息利率一般追蹤其美元對應利率，同時亦受本地供求影響。整體而言，港元匯率及貨幣市場保持穩定，交易順暢有序。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢屢展現其應對各種外部衝擊的強韌與實力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定性被定義為香港貨幣在外匯市場上對美元的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的波動範圍內。該貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由存放在外匯基金的美元儲備支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括以下內容：\n- 債務證書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供充分擔保；\n- 政府發行並在流通中的紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總結餘額，即存於香港金融管理局（HKMA）清算賬戶的餘額總和；以及\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性透過自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行貨幣可兌換承諾（Convertibility Undertakings, CUs）來維持。當強方或弱方CUs被觸發時，HKMA將根據銀行需求，以每美元7.75港元（或7.85港元）的匯率，向銀行買入或賣出港元以換取美元。此操作將使總餘額擴張（或收縮），進而壓低（或提高）港元利率，協助港元匯率回復至7.75至7.85的可兌換區間內。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n#匯率穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將長期維持高位的背景下，港元於2023年整體表現偏弱，全年大多數時間交易於聯繫匯率制度的弱方水平。自二月中旬至五月初，弱方兌換約束機制共被觸發八次。五月初至七月間，港元匯率一度回升，部分受上市公司股息發放相關需求及企業半年度資金需求所推動。其後，港元主要受本地資金需求變化影響，例如透過南向股票通的買入資金流動，並於年底時段圍繞7.8的中間價波動（圖1）。總體而言，2023年港元匯率市場持續正常運作。\n\n圖表 1 2023年市場匯率\n\n二月至五月期間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，應銀行要求，在弱方貨幣單位（CU）購入總額達515億港元。反映弱方貨幣單位被觸發，聚合餘額由2022年底的963億港元減少至2023年底的450億港元。同時，當年未償還的外匯基金票据（EFBNs）由1,200.4億港元略微增至1,245.5億港元。因此，聚合餘額與未償還EFBNs總額由2022年底的1,296.7億港元下降至2023年底的1,290.4億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖表2 2023年總結餘額（未計入貼現窗口）及未償還之Exchange Fund票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）通常與其美元對應利率保持一致。由於美國在2023年前七個月持續加息，HIBOR亦普遍上調（圖3）。截至年底，過夜、1個月及3個月HIBOR分別上調286、92及16個基點，達到6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，基準利率自4.75%上調四次，總計提高1個百分點（即100個基點），達到5.75%。在零售方面，跟隨美國政策利率上調，多家銀行於五月初將最佳貸款利率提高12.5個基點，又於七月底再提高12.5個基點。部分銀行亦在當年提高新批按揭貸款中以HIBOR為基礎的利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港貨幣市場持續正常運作。貼現窗借款額由2022年的84億港元增至2023年的388億港元，相關使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖表3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）在過去四十年間一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並在面對各種挑戰時展現出其強大與韌性。儘管美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦仍存在持續不確定性，香港美元匯兌及貨幣市場仍有序運作，反映出聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。特區政府堅定支持聯繫匯率制度。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）在其2023年《外部部門報告》中再次強調，聯繫匯率制度的可信度已透過一套透明的規則體系、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管體系、靈活的經濟體制以及謹慎的財政框架得以確保。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續穩定運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率均達國際高水平。為確保銀行業韌性，香港金融管理局持續密切監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，並審視壓力測試結果，同時維持對銀行貸款的監管力度。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中劃出特定部分用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）由2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的高點112.71%，超越了112.5%的上限觸發水平（見圖4）。此情況主要反映當年上半年因觸發弱方貨幣單位（CU）而導致總結餘收縮。根據發行基金顧問委員會批准的安排，並因贖回債務證書，資產已從支持組合轉移至投資組合，使支持比率於5月8日降至約109.97%。其後，支持比率穩步上升，於12月31日收於110.73%。根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），雖然已指定特定的發行基金資產用於支持組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。發行基金充足的財政資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖表4 2023年擔保比率的日波動\n\n# 貨幣局子委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣局小組委員會（CBC）負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2023年，CBC審視的議題包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩潰、聯邦儲備系統美元流動性後備措施對香港銀行的傳導，以及港元利率的近期走勢。CBC就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣局運作報告，均於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n下表總結了截至2023年底流通紙幣和硬幣的價值：\n\n圖5 截至2023年底各發鈔銀行流通中的紙鈔\n\n圖表6：2023年底流通中紙幣的分布\n\n圖表7 截至2023年底流通紙幣\n\n圖表8 截至2023年底流通中的政府發行紙幣與硬幣\n\n圖表9 2023年底流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣構成分析\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n在本年度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續為銀行櫃員、零售機構的出納員及學生舉辦有關香港紙幣設計及防偽特徵的研討會，以協助提升他們辨識紙幣的知識及技能。2023年共安排了15場研討會，約有3,000名參與者。\n\n# 硬幣收藏計畫\n\n硬幣收藏計劃持續受到公眾廣泛歡迎。有關此計劃的更多資訊，請參閱《2023年可持續發展報告》中「香港金融管理局可持續發展」專章。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\nEFBN計劃運作順利。截至2023年底，未償還的外匯基金票據名義金額約為1,255.4億港元（表2）。\n\n表2：EFBNs 尚待解決的問題\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣與金融研究機構（HKIMR）作為香港財經學院的研究部門，發表了20篇工作論文，並舉辦了17場研討會／網絡研討會，主題涵蓋對香港及地區具有戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題。HKIMR亦在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）上發表了六份電子期刊，以向SSRN的全球研究社群傳播研究成果。此外，為向公眾提供近期發表的工作論文之高階、非技術性摘要，HKIMR發行了兩期《貨幣研究洞見》。\n\n除了其研究活動外，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）舉辦了四項國際活動、一場圓桌會議及四場研討會／網上研討會，與學術界、全球中央銀行及國際金融機構進行對話與交流，推動有關經濟及金融議題的討論與知識分享。\n\n# 3月9日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）中國高級常駐代表史蒂文·艾倫·巴內特博士與IMF中華人民共和國香港特別行政區（HKSAR）常駐代表帕卡瓦·賈薩庫爾博士主講的「中國經濟復甦：近期發展與展望」研討會舉行。巴內特博士分享了他對中國經濟最新發展情況的看法，以及需要應對的短期和中期問題。逾100名與會者參與了此次研討會。\n\n# 4月17日\n\n應對充滿挑戰的世界研討會舉行。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）四位專家分享了他們對IMF最新一期《世界經濟展望》與《全球金融穩定報告》分析章節的觀點。研討會吸引了超過50位與會者參與。\n\n# 4月25日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）於2023年4月發布的《全球金融穩定報告》研討會已舉行，主題為「在高通貨膨脹與高利率環境下維護全球金融穩定」，由IMF貨幣與資本市場部助理主任吳健森博士與高級金融部門專家湯馬斯·波尼克先生主講。逾80位與會者參與了此次研討會。\n\n# 五月二日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）亞洲及太平洋部主任克里希納·斯里尼瓦桑（Krishna Srinivasan）與香港金融管理局（HKMA）總裁余偉文（Eddie Yue）共同主持了一場以「在充滿挑戰的世界中探討亞洲」為主題的座談會。斯里尼瓦桑先生概述了IMF最新亞洲區域經濟展望報告的重點內容，並分享了他對全球及區域經濟主要驅動因素與風險的看法。此外，座談會亦探討了與區域經濟及國際貨幣體系演變相關的多項重要議題。約120名參與者出席了活動。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2023年面對多重逆境，包括美國及歐洲三月的銀行動盪、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢，仍保持強大且具韌性。香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速應對三月銀行動盪，從管理後續影響至完成內部檢討（涵蓋監管程序及解決框架等範疇），為本地銀行業汲取經驗教訓，同時持續關注認可機構的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理。鑒於網絡威脅日益升級，以及第三方科技服務使用不斷增加，HKMA亦與認可機構緊密合作，提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局加強了對支付卡的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂《銀行業守則》以及推出《反詐騙消費者保護公約》。金管局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動制定平衡的監管框架，簡化成熟專業投資者的銷售流程，優化「跨境財富管理互聯互通試點計劃」，並開始監管信託業務。此外，金管局亦啟動了一項試點計劃，為在「Credit Data Smart」框架下提供消費者信貸資料服務作準備。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，體現了其在風險為本策略下針對最高威脅的承諾。為應對日益增加的數字詐騙，HKMA 透過推出實時詐騙監測系統，並擴展公私合作資訊共享夥伴關係的範圍，包括成立詐騙及洗錢情報行動小組，以加強生態系統合作。推出一個開創性的平台以促進銀行間資訊共享，將有助於應對人頭賬戶網絡的風險。同時，HKMA 亦與業界密切合作，採取協同行動處理日益增加的與詐騙相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對各種詐騙手法的警覺，包括在使用快速支付系統時的交易前警示機制。此外，亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃，進一步提升監管科技能力。\n\n在本地落實國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足性及資訊披露等領域。同時，銀行業能力建設亦有顯著提升，具體體現在吸引及培育未來人才、提升現有專業人員技能等方面。此外，香港存款保障局已完成有關存款保障計劃擬議改進措施的公開諮詢。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推進相關工作，以確保建立可信的解決機制。管理局制定了一項與接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決標準，並完成對實施吸收損失能力政策標準經驗的檢討。與銀行合作進行解決規劃方面亦取得重大進展，重點應對解決過程中的提前終止風險及營運持續性問題。香港金融管理局亦持續積極參與國際政策倡議及區域合作，推動解決機制的發展。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於一個具備高度韌性的金融體系，能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其營運方式，以及在極端情況下以無序方式倒閉，可能影響金融體系的穩定性。作為監管機構，金融管理局在維護金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，致力確保銀行具備應對衝擊的韌性，並能在危機中恢復其運作，從而最終協助預防失敗。金融管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並在香港授權持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，香港金融管理局（HKMA）作為處置機構，致力於確保在認可機構（AI）無法持續經營時，其失敗可被有序處理。為此，香港已建立針對金融機構的處置機制，根據該機制，HKMA 是認可機構及其他類型機構的處置機構。為有效落實香港的處置機制，制定處置規則與政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除影響認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及提升 HKMA 處理失敗認可機構的運作能力，至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，HKMA 採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。在監管FMIs時，金管局旨在提升其整體安全與效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。加強FMIs對金融危機的韌性，有助保障香港的貨幣及金融系統，免受FMIs中斷可能引致的不穩定影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 授權許可\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局向兩間在香港境外註冊的銀行發出一項銀行牌照及一項受限銀行牌照。此外，香港金融管理局亦批准四間外國交易平台營運商取得貨幣經紀資格，並撤銷另一家貨幣經紀的批准。香港金融管理局在本年度內亦撤銷五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n有關人工智能及香港本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱附錄（第313至316頁）及表格D至F（第322至325頁）。\n\n# 三級銀行體系評析\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）對香港銀行體系的三級制度進行全面檢討，以簡化銀行體系結構。檢討發現，現行三級制度已比實現原目標——在銀行體系入行靈活性與保障小額存款人之間取得平衡——所需的複雜程度更高。隨後，HKMA於6月展開為期三個月的諮詢，就建議將三級銀行體系簡化為兩級的方案徵求意見，具體措施為將吸收存款公司合併至受限制牌照銀行部門，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第二級。諮詢回應普遍支持該建議。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了177項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理及風險管理。作為HKMA持續推動強化風險治理的一部分，與持牌機構（AIs）的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會級別委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，HKMA亦與持牌機構及其外部審計師舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了離場活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦定期對認可機構（AIs）的各項活動進行現場檢查。鑑於高利率環境及部分內地房地產開發商出現債務違約，信貸風險管理成為重點關注領域。隨著認可機構對科技的採用進一步加速，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦成為另一個主要關注點。HKMA亦加強對氣候風險管理的監管工作，推出新一輪以氣候相關風險治理為主題的專項檢查，並舉辦一系列諮詢會，為認可機構提供監管指引。\n\n2023年3月開始的美國及歐洲銀行動盪，就規模及範圍而言，是自2008年全球金融危機以來最嚴重的系統性銀行壓力事件。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在動盪期間保持高度警覺，並採取一系列預防性措施，以確保任何潛在後果不會損害本地銀行及金融體系的信心。事件過後，HKMA根據從動盪中獲得的觀察及經驗進行內部檢討。基於此次檢討，HKMA制定了詳細的行動計劃，納入所吸取的教訓，以強化監管效能，並提升處理銀行危機的能力。詳情請參閱第95頁的「流動性及市場風險」部分。\n\n在行為監理方面，香港金融管理局對證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務，以及消費者保護事宜進行實地檢查，並針對被評估為風險較高或涉及新舉措的範疇，輔以主題式審查。\n\n表1載列香港金融管理局（HKMA）2023年的監管活動摘要。\n\n表1 監督活動摘要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n2023年總貸款額下降3.6%，較2022年3.0%的降幅進一步擴大。表2顯示貸款及信貸增長的細分情況。與內地相關的貸款在2023年減少6.6%，降至4,226億港元（見表3）。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款增長\n\n表3：內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局在高利率環境及內地樓市持續疲弱的背景下，加強對授權機構資產質素的監測，並評估其信貸風險管理實踐。當年銀行業資產質素有所惡化，但整體仍屬可控範圍。截至2023年底，銀行業分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。與內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率則由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局進行了有針對性及主題性的檢查，以評估授權機構在信貸風險管理方面的表現，重點包括對易受影響行業的風險敞口、保費融資、對香港以外業務的信貸風險監管，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n#緩解銀行客戶面臨的現金流壓力\n\n香港金融管理局與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制於七月宣布，將有序退出「預先批准本金還款假期計劃」。該計劃於二零二零年五月推出，旨在協助合資格企業渡過疫情。經考慮商業界意見後，已加強部分本金還款選項，以協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。對於疫情結束後仍面臨困難的行業或個別借款人，銀行將根據個案情況，繼續提供本金寬限期或其他適當的信貸緩解措施。\n\n香港金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與該計劃但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業之資金需求時，展現同理心。金管局提醒銀行在處理企業償還問題時，應遵循《香港企業困難處理指引》，以確保各貸款機構能在共同利益下協同行動，共同應對相關挑戰。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）陸續推出多輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，有效強化銀行對物業按揭貸款業務的風險管理，並提升銀行業應對樓價急跌所帶來挑戰的能力。2023年批准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）為57%，較2009年9月首次推出逆週期措施前的64%有所下降（見圖1）。2023年新按揭貸款的平均債務償還比率（DSR）維持在40%的低位，較2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%略低。\n\n7月7日，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在考慮樓價、交易量及本地和外部經濟環境等因素後，調整了逆週期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年推出住宅物業逆週期宏觀審慎措施以來首次放寬。調整內容包括提高住宅物業、商業物業及按抵押申請人淨資產評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款與價值比率（LTV）。此外，取消了對主要收入來源為香港以外地區的按揭申請人需降低適用最高LTV比率及債務服務比率（DSR）上限10個百分點的要求。香港金融管理局亦取消了當按揭申請人的總按揭融資額超出其正常可接受LTV上限20個百分點時，需對適用DSR上限減5個百分點的要求。\n\n圖表1 新核准住宅抵押貸款的平均貸款價值比率及負債收入比率\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins. Some of the common subjects of enquiries concerned banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received by the Public Enquiry Service since 2020, and Chart 2 provides a breakdown of the nature of enquiries received in 2023.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023\n\n# Publications\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published its Annual Report 2022 along with its first standalone Sustainability Report 2022. The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n","zh":"# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的機構職能以高度透明度、問責性、效率及專業精神支持其運作。為促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解，HKMA透過傳統媒體及社交媒體、HKMA網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，積極與社區及市場參與者溝通。\n\n香港金融管理局內部正致力於建立一支靈活且專業的員工隊伍，維持嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升其數字化能力，以適應變化，確保其政策和措施能有效落實。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 傳媒關係與社交媒體運用\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度並促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。2023年，HKMA舉辦或參與了188項公開傳媒活動，包括11場記者會、6場傳媒簡報會、15場即席訪問及156項其他公開活動。全年內，HKMA亦安排了額外25場傳媒採訪，發佈583份雙語新聞發佈稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n香港金融管理局為提高本地、內地及外國媒體對其主要職能的認識，舉辦了新聞發佈會及媒體簡報會。主題包括反詐騙行動、中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）及穩定幣。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2023年舉辦的各項活動中，傳媒代表積極參與，尤以第二屆全球金融領袖投資峰會為最。這場為期三天的活動在本地、內地及國際媒體上產生超過2,000篇正面且具事實根據的新聞報導。\n\n葉艾迪行政總裁於2023年香港金融科技週的媒體發言會上發言。\n\n岳艾迪首席執行官於全球金融領袖投資峰會上進行媒體發言。\n\nArthur Yuen 先生（右起第一人），副行政長官，於《反詐騙消費者保護憲章》活動中主持分享會。\n\n李浩德先生（中間），副行政長官，主持有關電子港元試點計劃第一階段報告的媒體簡報會。\n\n陳達理先生（左起第一人），副行政總裁，於2023年財政市場高峰會上主持專題討論會。\n\n創意的社交媒體內容有助提高公眾對香港金融管理局倡議及一系列其他議題的關注。\n\n為更有效地與公眾互動，香港金融管理局（HKMA）營運六大社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、微信、X（原Twitter）及YouTube），總共有超過15萬名追蹤者。HKMA舉辦的重要峰會及會議，包括全球金融領袖投資峰會，均會透過社交媒體進行現場直播，以提高公眾及業界的參與度。HKMA亦會製作具創意的社交媒體內容，提升公眾對各類主題及倡議的認識。近期內容涵蓋消費者保護及詐騙防範、快速支付系統、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及HKMA的重要活動等主題。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n香港金融管理局的公眾查詢服務為公眾提供一個有效途徑，以更深入了解其主要職能及運作。\n\n二零二三年，公眾查詢服務處理了九千五百六十五宗查詢。其中約一半涉及消費者銀行業務、銀行政策及規則、金融基礎設施及債務市場發展，以及紙幣和硬幣。常見的查詢主題包括銀行產品及服務、硬幣收藏計劃、零售債券發行計劃、銀行相關指引及通函，以及快速支付系統。\n\n圖表1顯示自2020年起公眾查詢服務接收到的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則提供2023年接收到的查詢性質類別分析。\n\n圖1：公眾查詢總數\n\n圖表 2 2023年收到的查詢性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n在本年度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）發佈了其《2022年年度報告》及首份獨立的《2022年可持續發展報告》。《2022年年度報告》於香港管理專業協會舉辦的2023年度最佳年度報告頒獎典禮中，在「非牟利及慈善機構」類別中榮獲金獎，為該類別的最高榮譽。同時，《2022年可持續發展報告》亦在香港會計師公會舉辦的2023年度最佳企業管治及ESG獎項中，於「公營機構\/非牟利機構（大型）」類別中奪得ESG獎項。\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）發佈了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》及四期《季度通訊》，並定期更新《月度統計通訊》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊與分析。HKMA亦發佈了14篇「洞見1」（inSight1）文章，介紹主要新政策及措施，並探討當前熱門議題。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n香港金融管理局的官方網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供近6萬頁的英文、繁體及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的主要途徑。網站載有根據《銀行條例》（BO）第20條維護的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs證券從業人員登記冊，並載有根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維護的儲值設施牌照持有人登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局自2018年起分階段透過開放應用程式介面（Open API）在其網站上發布財務數據及重要資訊。至2023年底，香港金融管理局已在網站上開放175組開放API，符合其既定時間表。\n\n香港金融管理局的開放API平台：\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，設有展覽區及圖書館，旨在向公眾介紹金管局的工作，並提升對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。互動式展覽區概述金管局的職能，並展示香港貨幣與銀行業的發展歷程，同時提供有助於研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資訊與展品。\n\n本年度，資訊中心接待了超過三萬一千名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過四百八十場導覽活動。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏逾26,000冊有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務，以及中央銀行主題的書籍、期刊及其他出版物。根據《銀行業條例》第20條規定，圖書館亦維護授權機構及其本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及授權機構證券人員的登記冊，供公眾查閱。\n\n年輕遊客在香港資訊中心的導覽行程中了解香港紙幣的設計。\n\n資訊中心導覽（針對幼稚園學生）\n\n# 社區參與與公眾教育\n\n自1998年起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直推行公眾教育計劃，向社區推廣其工作，提高公眾對其工作的認識。截至目前為止，已有超過66,000人參與該公眾教育計劃。2023年，HKMA為來自58間中學的逾1,200名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會，主題包括HKMA的工作概覽、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字密鑰的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融以及銀行業的職業發展機會。\n\n香港金融管理局致力教育公眾，使其成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙及信用卡詐騙案件持續增加，香港金融管理局持續透過不同媒體提醒公眾保持警覺。在《反詐騙消費者保護守則》推出後，香港金融管理局亦推出全新宣傳活動，強調銀行及主要商戶已承諾不會透過即時電子訊息傳送連結，以索取個人資料及信用卡資料。香港金融管理局亦透過電台及社交媒體平台，向公眾提供有關信用卡、個人貸款、網上購物、銀行服務及不同支付方式（包括「先買後付」產品）的實用貼士。\n\n以「保護您的個人數位金鑰；小心詐騙連結！」為主題，製作了一部新影片，內容包含食人植物與動物陷阱。\n\n跨媒體宣傳旨在提醒公眾切勿點擊可疑連結。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation Quality & Fluency:**  \n   - The first translation (跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾不要點擊可疑連結。) is concise but omits the causal relationship implied by \"is produced reminding,\" which weakens the logical connection between the publicity and its purpose.  \n   - The second translation (跨媒體宣傳旨在提醒公眾不要點擊可疑連結。) improves clarity by adding \"旨在\" (aimed at), but \"不要\" is slightly less urgent than the original's \"not to click.\"  \n   - The fourth translation (跨媒體宣傳旨在提醒公眾成員勿點擊可疑連結) redundantly adds \"成員\" (members), which is unnecessary since \"公眾\" already implies the general public.  \n   - The fifth translation (跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾切勿點擊可疑連結。) uses \"切勿\" (strictly avoid), which better captures the cautionary tone of the original.  \n2. **Grammar & Vocabulary:**  \n   - \"公眾成員\" in the fourth translation is grammatically correct but semantically redundant.  \n   - \"勿\" in the third and fifth translations is more formal and aligns with the tone of public safety warnings.  \n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:**  \n   - \"切勿\" is commonly used in Chinese public service announcements to emphasize caution, making it more culturally appropriate than \"不要\" in this context.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Retain \"旨在\" to explicitly state the purpose of the publicity.  \n- Use \"切勿\" for stronger emphasis on the warning.  \n- Remove redundant terms like \"成員\" to ensure conciseness.  \n**Final Translation:**  \n跨媒體宣傳旨在提醒公眾切勿點擊可疑連結。\n\n用於推廣e-laisees的動畫影片\n\n為支持環境保護，並借鑒金融科技的進展，香港金管局透過社交媒體及電台宣傳，鼓勵市民於農曆新年期間發放電子利是（e-laisees），並考慮使用狀況良好、幾乎全新的紙幣作為實體利是。\n\n香港金融管理局亦致力提升公眾對金融業的認識，並激勵年輕人對投身該行業的興趣，從而擴大香港金融業的人才儲備。繼其早前推出的視頻系列《中環人才四面觀》獲得正面回應後，香港金融管理局推出全新視頻系列《金融特種部隊：開拓新視野》，內容聚焦金融業四大發展領域：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。該視頻系列運用電腦圖形及動畫，展示資深市場從業者指導年輕人才應對日常工作挑戰，以輕鬆入門的方式介紹行業內的職業機會與發展前景。\n\n為讓年輕一代掌握金融領域的職業機會，特製作系列影片《金融特種部隊：解鎖新視野》。\n\n來自不同領域的導師與學生分享他們的專業知識和經驗。\n\n為提升中學生的財務素養，香港金融管理局連續第九年與其他持份者合作，共同舉辦「香港財務素養錦標賽」。活動以「數碼及可持續經濟」為主題，協助學生深入了解財務管理、綠色與可持續發展、當前金融市場情況及職業發展機會。活動內容包括一個網上知識競賽，收到約20,000份參與申請，並由來自不同領域的資深專業人士提供導師指導，以及設計思維挑戰賽。\n\n# $mart 理財 321\n\n香港金融管理局推出首個財務教育桌遊「$mart Money Management 321」，該桌遊與專注於桌遊製作的社會企業共同設計及開發。此桌遊旨在透過模擬情境，協助小學生學習不同的支付方式、財務管理概念、金融科技及網絡安全知識。\n\n香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMA）於2023年香港書展設有攤位，推廣該桌遊，該產品為書展中最暢銷的項目之一。此外，HKMA還舉辦了一系列免費推廣活動，包括在社區中心舉辦的工作坊、為小學生安排的試玩活動，以及為小學教師及非政府機構社工舉辦的「培訓導師」工作坊，並在節慶期間於PMQ運營「$mart Money Management Experiential Centre」體驗中心。\n\n香港金管局推出的首款理財教育桌遊「$mart Money Management 321」及「$mart Money Management 體驗中心」獲頒多項國際設計獎項。\n\n在香港書展推出後，這款桌遊透過培訓講師的工作坊、學生試玩活動及位於PMQ的體驗中心進行推廣。\n\n香港金融管理局亦與不同持份者合作推行多項社區參與計劃。其中一項為與一所教育機構聯合舉辦的跨世代外展教育計劃第二階段，內容包括銀行模擬遊戲，以及針對幼稚園學生、家長、教師和年輕成年人的講座。\n\n香港金融管理局持續支持投資者及財務教育委員會推動香港市民財務素養及財務能力的工作，並將進一步與不同持份者合作，以最大化社區參與工作的影響力。\n\n#財務披露\n\n為維持高度透明度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在適用於中央銀行業務的範圍內，採用國際財務披露標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發布標準。財務部與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，按照香港財務報告準則編製及呈報外匯基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦在其年度報告中，就各種費用項目和預算資訊提供詳細披露及深入分析。\n\n# 問責與控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要的任務之一，是管理對貨幣及銀行體系的風險。風險管理既在日常運作的工作層面進行，亦透過戰略規劃在更高層面推行。香港金融管理局的風險管理框架下設有兩個高層級委員會，即宏觀監測委員會及風險委員會，兩者均由香港金融管理局總裁主持。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 交易所基金\n\n# 審計主任報告書\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審計載於第211至311頁的交易所基金及其附屬公司（「該集團」）財務報表，該財務報表包括交易所基金及該集團截至2023年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該會計年度的收入及支出帳戶、綜合損益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策資訊。\n\n依我之見，截至2023年12月31日，基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，均在財務報表中得到真實及公允的反映。該財務報表乃根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並已遵照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒佈的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條頒發的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行審計。我在這些標準下的責任，已在報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節進一步說明。根據這些標準，我與該集團保持獨立，並已按照這些標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據已足夠且適當，作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指根據我的專業判斷，在截至2023年12月31日止年度財務報表之審計過程中最具重要性之事項。這些事項係在我對財務報表整體進行審計之背景下加以處理，並在形成我的審計意見時予以考量，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括載於香港金融管理局二零二三年度報告中的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及關於財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我亦不會就該等資訊發表任何形式的保證意見。\n\n在審計財務報表的過程中，我的責任是審閱其他資訊，並在此過程中評估該資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否明顯存在重大錯報。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該資訊存在重大錯報，我有責任報告此情況。就本項事宜，我無任何事項需報告。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金顧問委員會審計小組就財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及行政長官根據《發行基金條例》第7條所發出的指示，編製真實且公允的財務報表，並實施貨幣管理局認為必要以確保財務報表無重大錯報（不論係因詐欺或錯誤所致）的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營的能力，並在適用情況下披露與持續經營相關的事項，同時採用持續經營基礎的會計處理。\n\n外匯基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在因舞弊或錯誤所致的重大錯報，並出具包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證代表高水平的保證，但並非保證根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總能發現已存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合計而言，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計總署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我在整個審計過程中行使專業判斷並保持專業懷疑。此外，我還：\n\n識別並評估財務報表重大錯報的風險，不論係因舞弊或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對該等風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我提出意見的基礎。因舞弊導致重大錯報未被發現的風險，高於因錯誤導致的風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制；  \n了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適宜於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對集團內部控制有效性發表意見；  \n評估貨幣當局所採用會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計及相關披露的合理性；  \n對貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，則必須在審計師報告中提請關注財務報表中相關披露，或若披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計師報告日所取得的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；  \n評估財務報表整體的列報、結構及內容，包括披露，並判斷財務報表是否以達成公允列報的方式反映其背後的交易及事件；以及  \n取得關於集團內各實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且適當審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與交換基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會就審計的預計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺失等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向匯兌基金顧問委員會之審計小組提供聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，如適用時，亦說明相關保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項，我確定本期財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果合理預期會超過此類披露所帶來的公共利益效益，否則我會在我的審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n林志源尼爾遜教授  \n審計總監\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（基金）主管機構的授權，依照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是維持香港貨幣的匯率穩定，並保障香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整。\n\n基金的資產分為四個組合進行管理：後備組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。根據香港貨幣發行局制度，後備組合的資產完全與香港的貨幣基礎相匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合則持有香港特別行政區政府為基金戰略目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。營運部門的資料載於附註31。\n\n# 二、重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 為一總稱，涵蓋所有適用的個別 HKFRSs、香港會計準則及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的解釋，以及在香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（以下統稱為「集團」）採用的重要會計政策如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的或經修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於本集團本期會計期間首次生效或可供提前採用。附註3載列了因首次應用這些準則而導致的會計政策變更（如有），並說明這些變更是否與本財務報表所反映的本期及往期會計期間相關。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司及合營企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表之編製採用歷史成本為計量基礎，惟下列資產及負債係按公允價值計量：  \n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；  \n- 透過損益帳戶按公允價值計量之金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；  \n- 透過其他綜合收益按公允價值計量之金融資產（附註2.6）；  \n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及  \n- 投資性不動產（附註2.11）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的應用，以及資產、負債、收入及開支的報告金額。這些估計及相關假設基於歷史經驗及其他在當時情況下被認為合理的因素，其結果構成了評估資產及負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非容易從其他來源得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及其相關假設會持續進行審查。若會計估計的修正僅影響當期，則該修正於當期認列；若修正同時影響當期及未來期間，則該修正於修正當期及未來期間認列。\n\n管理層於應用香港財務報告準則時所作出的對財務報表有重大影響的判斷，以及主要的估計不確定性來源，均於附註2.18中披露。\n\n某些比較數字已重述，以符合本集團財務報表本年度的列報方式。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是指由集團所控制的實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而暴露於或擁有來自該實體的變動回報，且具備透過對該實體的控制權影響該等回報之能力。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考量由集團及其他當事人所持有的實質權利。\n"}
