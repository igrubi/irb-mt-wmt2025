{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","en":"# CEO Report\n\nThe global political and economic stage in 2016 was frequently marked by \"black swan\" events. While the Brexit referendum and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election rendered various polls a laughingstock, the most unexpected development was the financial markets' reaction. Taking the U.S. election as an example, news of Donald Trump's victory initially caused the futures of the three major U.S. stock indices to sharply decline before the market opened. However, shortly after trading began, the indices rebounded and subsequently soared, repeatedly reaching new highs. These events highlighted the limitations of traditional wisdom and frameworks in predicting market movements, and marked a significant level of uncertainty in future global developments.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial indicators have reflected unusually sensitive market sentiment: the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July, then surged to 2.6% by mid-December following the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar’s performance against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high by year-end. Meanwhile, New York crude oil futures prices rebounded from a year-start low of $26 per barrel to $54 by year-end. In Hong Kong’s stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 86 points for the year, though the peak-to-trough difference during the period exceeded 6,000 points. Against this backdrop of turbulent external conditions, the importance and value of financial stability—particularly in the monetary and banking systems—have become even more evident.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors of international hedge funds targeting the Chinese yuan and Hong Kong dollar spread widely, sowing market uncertainty. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly conveyed clear and resolute messages to the market, asserting our absolute confidence and capability in defending the linked exchange rate system and maintaining the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system, thereby stabilizing market confidence. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained consistently close to the strong-side exchange rate guarantee. Due to ample liquidity in the banking system, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in December 2015 and March 2016 did not immediately or significantly affect the Hong Kong dollar’s interest rates or exchange rate.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system continues to develop steadily, with overall loan growth of 6.5% last year. Asset quality remains sound, and the non-performing loan ratio is maintained at a healthy level of 0.85%, far below the long-term average of around 2% since 2000. The banking system's capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio both remain well above statutory requirements. In the mortgage sector, following seven rounds of countercyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential property mortgages has decreased from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016, while the average debt service-to-income ratio has also declined from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing the necessary buffer should the property market cycle reverse and impact the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor developments in the property market and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nLegislative work to further strengthen the stability of the banking system made encouraging progress last year. Two ordinances—optimizing the deposit insurance system and addressing the \"too big to fail\" risks of financial institutions—were successfully passed before the previous Legislative Council term ended. The former accelerates the disbursement of deposit insurance funds and simplifies procedures, thereby enhancing depositors' confidence in the banking system. The latter establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks arising from their potential collapse and to minimize reliance on public funds for bailouts. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established a Resolution Mechanism Office on April 1 this year to implement the requirements of the ordinances and oversee follow-up actions.\n\nThe banking industry is often referred to as the \"mother of all industries,\" serving as a vital channel for savings, payments, and credit for the real economy and the general public's daily lives. This year, some representatives from the SME sector reported difficulties in obtaining financing. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) promptly communicated with the banking sector, urging banks to continue providing financial support for SME operations and development while maintaining prudent risk management. We also leveraged our subsidiary, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, to enhance the promotion of the government's SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to the business community. We maintained close communication with the banking sector to address concerns, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for bad debts, thereby increasing banks' willingness to participate in the program. Through these multifaceted measures, we have achieved some success. According to the HKMA's survey of banks, the overall credit facilities for SMEs remained stable last year, with over 90% of businesses maintaining or even increasing their credit limits. Meanwhile, the number of applications for the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme has also risen significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services have become indispensable components of business operations and daily life. Last year, upon learning that some overseas companies and startups encountered difficulties in opening bank accounts in Hong Kong, we promptly initiated follow-up actions, contacting multiple international chambers of commerce and business associations, and engaging in in-depth discussions with the banking sector to address the issues effectively. In September last year, I issued a notice to all Hong Kong banks, clarifying how to interpret the HKMA’s “risk-based” regulatory principles concerning anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and how to apply these principles to account opening procedures and due diligence measures for existing customers. The notice emphasized that banks should not adopt a “one-size-fits-all” approach to requirements and procedures for all clients. Following consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account openings has improved, but there remains room for further progress, which remains one of our key priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently encouraged banks to consider the basic banking service needs of the public alongside their profit-making activities. With fintech advancing at an unprecedented pace, the channels through which banks provide services are becoming increasingly diversified. In addition to the growing popularity of online banking, several banks launched mobile banking vehicles and video teller machine services last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive banking services compared to traditional ATMs. Under our initiative, multiple banks have also planned to establish physical branches in remote areas to enhance service provision for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial center is like rowing against the current; therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continuously sought new opportunities and explored new areas to advance the development of Hong Kong's financial industry over the years. 2016 proved to be a year of significant achievements, with financial technology (Fintech) and infrastructure financing standing out as key highlights.\n\nIn the field of fintech, Hong Kong's retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued 13 stored value payment tool licenses, creating a favorable business environment for retail payment services through licensing and an ongoing regulatory framework. Accompanied by a series of public education campaigns, this ensures consumers can enjoy the convenience brought by new technologies while their rights are reasonably protected.\n\nIn addition, in March last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Fintech Facilitation Office to promote the development of fintech related to the banking sector through this platform. Within several months, we launched multiple initiatives, including the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative,\" which established a new platform comprising risk assessment, information sharing, and talent development as three pillars to strengthen the cybersecurity of the banking system. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct specialized research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its feasibility for application in Hong Kong's banking sector. Furthermore, we set up the Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to the banking industry and the fintech sector. The HKMA's banking supervision department also introduced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, allowing banks to test new technologies within a smaller and controlled environment, thereby accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks have tested 14 new technology projects using the sandbox, with some of these projects already launched in the market, bringing more fintech products to the public.\n\nThe junior translators have produced generally accurate and fluent translations, but several areas merit refinement. Key strengths include consistent terminology (e.g., \"Memoranda of Understanding\"), accurate institutional names, and clear structure. However, weaknesses include redundancy (e.g., \"new and unique platform\" in multiple translations), awkward phrasing (\"domestically and internationally\" when context implies China vs. the rest of the world), and inconsistent use of abbreviations (e.g., \"IFFO\" vs. \"Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office\"). The phrase \"infrastructure investment and financing issues\" could be streamlined to \"infrastructure investment and financing.\" Additionally, \"operational period\" is more natural than \"establishment time.\" The best translation would integrate the most concise phrasing, precise terminology, and natural flow from the best elements of each version.\n---\nThe global demand for infrastructure financing is immense, particularly since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has made infrastructure financing a focal point of attention both within and outside China. As Asia’s international financial center, Hong Kong holds significant advantages in this field. In July last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), creating a new platform that brings together over 60 world-class multilateral institutions, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, as well as infrastructure project developers, operators, and various professional organizations. This platform enables the exchange of information, sharing of experiences, and exploration of collaboration opportunities in infrastructure investment and financing. Since its establishment, IFFO has organized more than a dozen large-scale conferences, seminars, and workshops. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also signed Memoranda of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although its operational period is relatively short, IFFO has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s future role as a global infrastructure financing hub.\n\nRemoving barriers and loosening constraints is the surest way to enhance competitiveness. This year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively participated in and supported the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in revising tax regulations, providing a favorable tax environment for companies conducting internal treasury operations within Hong Kong-based groups. We have also actively engaged with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their corporate treasury activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong's financial market.\n\nThe offshore RMB market was in an adjustment phase last year. Influenced by market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the scale of global offshore RMB funding pools generally contracted. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its leading position in offshore RMB business, retaining the world’s largest RMB funding pool, with daily RMB settlement amounts through Hong Kong remaining at a high level of approximately 860 billion RMB. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong’s offshore RMB market, in October last year we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, raising the total quota for bilateral liquidity support from 140 billion RMB to 180 billion RMB, ensuring the market could continue to operate in an orderly manner even in the event of liquidity shortages. In December last year, the launch of the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" added further momentum to Hong Kong’s RMB business. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also working with relevant mainland authorities to study the \"Bond Connect\" initiative, aiming to further facilitate participation of investors from both regions in the bond market and to enhance the connectivity of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite the global investment environment being fraught with uncertainties last year, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$68.1 billion in investment income, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented over the past several years. Since 1994, the fund's compound annual investment return rate has reached 4.8%, surpassing the local inflation rate of 2.1% during the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to pursue diversified investments, including further expanding asset classes and increasing allocations to credit assets, inflation-protected investment products, and emerging markets. As the flagship of its diversified investment strategy, the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" invests in alternative assets such as private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has consistently delivered strong performance, with an average annualized internal rate of return of approximately 12% since inception. With a portion of the government's \"Future Fund\" now allocated to this portfolio, investment pace has accelerated. As of the end of last year, the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" had assets under management of approximately HKD 181.8 billion, with total committed but undrawn funds for investment amounting to approximately HKD 133.8 billion. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to its investment strategy of \"capital preservation first, long-term value growth,\" seeking stable and sustainable returns while maintaining ample liquidity and reserve funds.\n"}

This year, the local stock market and residential property market have experienced fluctuations, and affordability for homeownership remains constrained.\n\nDespite increasing global market risks and shocks, Hong Kong's banking system remains resilient. Banks' capital and liquidity positions remain strong; asset quality has slightly deteriorated but remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite the volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has remained stable, reflecting the linked exchange rate system's ability to withstand external shocks.\n\nThe money market continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity in the interbank sector. In December, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise the target for the federal funds rate, Hong Kong's benchmark interest rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.00%.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is strengthening the risk governance frameworks of banks, as well as their management of credit, liquidity, and technology risks. It is also taking concrete steps to promote financial inclusion and address the difficulties that businesses encounter when opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, significant progress has been made in preparing Hong Kong to implement international regulatory and accounting standards, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in fluency and precision. Key observations:  \n1. **Opening Phrase:** \"Regarding regulatory policy\" (Translation 2) and \"In terms of regulatory policy\" (Translations 4, 6) are both natural, though \"In terms of\" is slightly more formal and better suited to policy contexts.  \n2. **Verb Phrase:** \"Preparing Hong Kong for the implementation\" (Translations 1, 2, 5) is grammatically correct but slightly wordy. \"Preparing Hong Kong to implement\" (Translation 6) is more concise and idiomatic in English.  \n3. **Ordinance Name:** The original specifies \"處置機制\" (resolution mechanism), which should be included in the ordinance title (Translations 3, 4, 5, 6). Omitting \"Mechanism\" (Translation 1, 2) risks ambiguity.  \n4. **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"This territory\" (Translation 5) is unnecessarily vague; \"Hong Kong\" is clearer and more direct.  \n5. **Fluency:** \"Which includes\" (Translation 3) is less direct than \"including\" (others), which flows better in this context.  \nThe optimal translation balances conciseness, accuracy, and formal tone, ensuring the ordinance’s full name is preserved while using natural phrasing like \"preparing Hong Kong to implement.\"\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nHong Kong maintains its position as a global offshore RMB business hub and asset management center. The tax system has been further improved to create a more favorable environment to attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing center and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Promotion Office and the Fintech Promotion Office. The HKMA successfully commenced the implementation of the regulatory framework for stored value payment tools and retail payment systems, and issued 13 licenses for stored value payment tools.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in terminology and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Office Names:** \"Facilitation Office\" (e.g., Translation 4\/5\/6) misrepresents the original \"促進辦公室\" (\"Promotion Office\"). \"Promotion\" aligns better with the goal of advancing these sectors.  \n2. **Regulatory Terminology:** \"Regulatory regime\" (Translation 4\/6) and \"regulatory frameworks\" (Translation 5) are acceptable, but \"regulatory framework\" (Translation 1\/2\/3) is more standard in financial contexts.  \n3. **Adverb Choice:** \"Smoothly\" (Translation 3\/6) and \"successfully\" (Translation 1\/2) both imply ease or achievement. The original \"順利開始實施\" (\"smoothly commenced implementation\") leans toward procedural success rather than exceptional achievement, making \"successfully\" slightly stronger than needed.  \n4. **Consistency:** Translations 4–6 inconsistently use \"Facilitation Office\" and \"stored-value facilities\" instead of \"stored value payment tools,\" which are precise terms in the original.  \n5. **Fluency:** Translation 2 avoids redundancy by using \"HKMA\" after the first mention, improving readability.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Retain \"Promotion Office\" for accuracy.  \n- Use \"regulatory framework\" for consistency with financial terminology.  \n- Replace \"smoothly\" with \"successfully\" to reflect procedural completion without overstating ease.  \n- Ensure \"stored value payment tools\" is used consistently.  \n- Maintain \"HKMA\" after the first mention for clarity.  \nThe final translation balances precision, fluency, and adherence to the original's intent.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nDespite a challenging investment environment fraught with black swan events, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of 2%, thanks to a series of defensive measures taken over the past few years that strengthened its resilience.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accelerating the diversification of its investments, particularly in the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Organizational Functions\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains effective communication with society and the market through media, public education activities, and various other channels, thereby enhancing the public's understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strengthen institutional governance, including promoting employee professional development, strictly controlling finances, and enhancing information technology security, to address the challenges posed by implementing new measures and increasingly demanding workloads.\n"}

The term \"gazetted\" (used in translations 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) is accurate for Hong Kong legal terminology, while translation 5's \"published\" is less precise. Translation 4 incorrectly uses \"Revised\" instead of \"Amendment,\" which is the standard term for legislative changes.  \nThe phrase \"thereby diversifying\" (translations 1, 2, 6) effectively links the ordinance's introduction to the outcome, though \"thereby making... more diversified\" (translation 6) adds clarity. However, \"diversifying\" alone is concise and natural. The structure \"introducing a new structure for open-ended fund companies\" (translations 1, 2, 5) is clear, while \"introducing a new open-ended fund company structure\" (translation 3) is slightly more compact.  \n\"Fund registration platform\" is acceptable but could be refined to \"fund registration framework\" for technical precision, though \"platform\" is commonly used in regulatory contexts. The use of \"corporate structure\" (translation 4) is redundant, as \"structure\" alone suffices.  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, conciseness, and legal terminology, ensuring clarity without unnecessary elaboration.\n\n# June 20th\n\nThe sixth tranche of retail inflation-linked bonds (iBond) has been issued under the government bond program.\n\n#June30\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance has been gazetted, providing the legal basis for establishing a cross-sector financial institution resolution mechanism in Hong Kong.\n\n#July\n\n# July 4th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority signed Memoranda of Understanding separately with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Center, aiming to promote investment and financing for infrastructure projects in Asia through the IFFO platform.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) to promote Hong Kong’s development as a hub for infrastructure financing.\n\n# July 5th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Boao Forum for Asia co-hosted a financial cooperation conference in Hong Kong, themed \"Finance Promoting the Real Economy.\"\n\n#July 20th\n\nThe joint electronic check clearing system between Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) and Hong Kong has been initiated.\n\n# August\n\n#August12\n\nThe first junior translator's version (\"The first tranche of silver bonds has been issued under the government bond program\") is grammatically sound and uses the financial term \"tranche,\" which is appropriate for bonds. However, \"tranche\" may be overly technical for general audiences. The second and fourth translations (\"Issue the first batch of silver bonds under the government bond program\") use active voice, which shifts focus to the issuer rather than the action itself, deviating slightly from the original's passive construction. The third and sixth translations (\"First batch of silver bonds issued under government bond program\") omit articles (\"the\") and lack a complete sentence structure, making them less formal. The fifth translation (\"The first issue of silver bonds under the government bond program\") uses \"issue\" as a noun, which is acceptable but less precise than \"batch\" for \"首批.\" \nTo improve, the translation should retain the passive voice to reflect the original's focus on the action rather than the subject, use \"batch\" for clarity, and ensure grammatical completeness. \nThe first batch of silver bonds has been issued under the government bond program.\n\n# August 25th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the issuance of the first batch of stored value payment tool licenses to five stored value payment tool issuers under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\").\n\n# September\n\n# September 6th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Financial and Treasury Market Association co-hosted the \"2016 Financial and Treasury Market Summit\" in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched a \"FinTech Regulatory Sandbox,\" enabling banks to test FinTech and other technologies before their full-scale implementation.\n\n# September 28th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted a seminar in Frankfurt, Germany, to promote Hong Kong’s role in the opportunities presented by China.\n\n# October\n\n# October 24–25\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of England, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) co-hosted a high-level seminar in Hong Kong on \"Interactions between Monetary, Financial, and Prudential Policies Post-Financial Crisis.\"\n\n# October 26–28\n\nIFFO hosted its first executive workshop titled \"Private Capital Participation in Investment and Financing for Infrastructure Projects in Emerging Markets\" and announced that 13 more institutions have joined as IFFO partners, bringing the total to over 50.\nThe original text emphasizes the specific focus on \"investment and financing\" (投融資) and the plural form \"new emerging markets\" (新興市場). While all translations capture the core meaning, several issues arise: (1) \"Emerging Market\" should be plural (\"Emerging Markets\") to match the original's plural context; (2) \"Private Capital Participation\" is more precise than \"Private Sector Participation\"; (3) \"Investment and Financing\" should precede \"Infrastructure Projects\" to align with the original's term order; (4) \"bringing the total number to over 50\" is slightly redundant, as \"total\" already implies a number. The best translation integrates these elements while maintaining natural English phrasing and formal tone.\n\n# October 27\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has expanded its Renminbi Primary Liquidity Provision Scheme, increasing the number of participating institutions from seven to nine and raising the total facility size to RMB 18 billion.

Key issues include:  \n1. **Name Accuracy:** Translators 2 and 3 incorrectly rendered the president’s name as \"Jin Liqiong\" and \"Jin Lique,\" respectively. The correct name is **Jin Liqun** (金立群).  \n2. **Verb Choice:** \"Explained\" (1), \"discussed\" (5), and \"elaborating on\" (6) all convey the action, but \"elaborated on\" best reflects the nuance of a detailed, structured presentation.  \n3. **Tense Consistency:** Translators 3 and 6 use the present tense (\"hosts,\" \"elaborating\"), which is inconsistent with the past-tense context of the event.  \n4. **Redundancy:** Translator 4’s \"featuring a presentation by\" adds unnecessary detail, while \"during which\" (1, 5) or \"where\" (2, 5) provides smoother flow.  \n5. **Cultural Nuance:** \"High-level seminar\" (2, 4, 5, 6) is more standard in formal contexts than \"senior-level seminar\" (1, 3).  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe final version corrects the name, uses \"elaborated on\" for precision, maintains past tense, and employs \"during which\" for clarity and formality.\n\n# November 11th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) held a \"FinTech Day\" and released a research white paper on distributed ledger technology.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has partnered with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to establish the \"FinTech Innovation Center,\" aiming to foster innovative ideas and test new FinTech technologies.\n\n# November 22\n\nThe Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, together with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission, and the Insurance Authority, have jointly issued a consultation document on the proposed regulations relating to protected arrangements under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong China Enterprise Association signed a Memorandum of Understanding to help more Chinese-funded enterprises establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖 6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth softened in 2016 amid weakening global economic and trade activity. Given the increasing uncertainty in the external environment, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with weak inbound tourism exerting pressure on service exports (Figure 1). Domestic demand momentum also slowed, though it continued to provide the primary support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained largely stable, with the unemployment rate maintained at a low level of 3.3% to 3.4%. Consumer price inflation further eased as local cost and external price pressures subsided. Facing a volatile external environment and shifting market sentiment, asset markets experienced increased volatility. In response to the renewed strength in the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite external market volatility and rising U.S. interest rates, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and monetary markets continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate, after a slight weakening in January, has remained hovering around the 7.75 level. The Convertibility Undertaking was not triggered during the year, and the aggregate balance, together with outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds, remained almost unchanged at approximately HK$1.2 trillion. Following the U.S. interest rate hike in mid-December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) raised its base rate from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels, but rose slightly towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the movements in their U.S. counterparts. Overall bank lending growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although overall loan quality deteriorated slightly, the ratio of classified loans remained at a very low level.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department  \nThe original text is a caption for a figure, requiring concise, formal phrasing. The fifth translation most accurately captures the structure and terminology, using \"Real Local GDP Growth\" to match \"實質本地生產總值增長\" and correctly identifying the source as \"Government Statistics Department.\" However, minor refinements improve clarity: \"Real Local GDP Growth\" is slightly more natural than \"Real Local GDP Growth\" (though both are acceptable), and the title format \"Figure 1: [Title]\" is standard for captions. The fourth translation incorrectly left \"生产总值\" untranslated, while the second and third used \"Statistics Office\" or \"Census and Statistics Department,\" which may not align with the official name. The sixth translation, though grammatically correct, uses a full sentence instead of a title format. The best approach combines the fifth translation's structure with precise terminology and formal caption style.\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Category (Year-over-Year)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly changes in total local fixed capital formation are not available.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Local Demand\n\nThe growth momentum of local demand slightly weakened in 2016. Although stable employment and income conditions continued to support private consumption, its growth rate fell to 1.6%, partly reflecting the intensification of economic uncertainties. Government consumption growth also slowed slightly to 3.3%. Total local fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Figure 2), resulting in a cumulative annual contraction of 0.5%. Private sector purchases of machinery and equipment remained the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid poor business outlooks, while residential construction activity turned more active due to increased housing starts.\n\nFigure 2: Local Demand. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# External Requirements\n\nHong Kong's exports showed signs of stabilization near the end of 2016, but the overall performance for the year remained weak (Figure 3). Merchandise exports rose 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015, benefiting from more stable intra-regional trade flows.  \nHong Kong's exports showed signs of stabilization near the end of 2016, but the overall performance for the year remained weak (Figure 3). Merchandise exports rose 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015, benefiting from more stable intra-regional trade flows.\n\nPartly reflecting the normalization of retail sales following rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong's service exports contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Goods imports, which had declined in 2015, partially recovered some ground in 2016, while service imports continued to grow, partly benefiting from increased outbound travel intentions among local residents. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, weighing on local economic growth.\n\nFigure 3: Merchandise Exports and Service Exports. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n#inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained under control in 2016. Excluding the impact of one-time government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Figure 4). The rental component of the composite consumer price index experienced a decline in inflation, driven by the pass-through effect of earlier reductions in newly leased private residential rents. Import price inflation was restrained, benefiting from softer global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar. Meanwhile, local cost pressures remained moderate, supported by stable labor cost growth and eased rental cost pressures, particularly in the retail sector.\n\nFigure 4: Core Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n#LaborMarket\n\nThe labor market remained largely stable in 2016, with similar increases in both labor supply and demand. By industry, labor market conditions in tourism-related sectors deteriorated, while other sectors remained largely stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Figure 5). Amidst the stable labor market, nominal wages increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared to an increase of 4.6% in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared to an increase of 1.5% in 2015.\n\nFigure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n#StockMarket\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant volatility in 2016. Affected by depreciation pressure on the Renminbi and fluctuations in the mainland Chinese stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). In March, the Hong Kong market rebounded following strong performance in the U.S. and other major global markets. Although the Brexit referendum triggered market turbulence, sentiment quickly improved amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would slow interest rate hikes and other major central banks would implement monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, the Hong Kong stock market came under renewed pressure in the fourth quarter, influenced by the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and expectations of accelerated U.S. interest rate hikes. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. The average daily turnover decreased from HK$105.6 billion in the previous year to HK$66.9 billion, while the total capital raised by the Hong Kong stock market also fell from HK$1,115.6 billion to HK$490.1 billion.  \nThe best translation integrates clarity, precision, and consistency. It avoids awkward phrasing (\"notable improvement,\" \"mildly rose\") and corrects numerical formatting errors (e.g., HK$1,115.6 billion instead of HK$11,156 billion). It uses \"capital raised\" for financial accuracy and maintains a formal tone appropriate for financial reporting. The structure mirrors the original text's logical flow while ensuring natural English phrasing.\n\nFigure 6: Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight fluctuations in 2016. After recording a historical low in transaction volumes during the first quarter, activity rebounded in the following months but declined again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, transaction volumes slightly decreased to 54,701 in 2016. On the other hand, property prices rose from the second quarter and surpassed the previous peak in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% for the year (Figure 6). Housing affordability remained tight, with a price-to-income ratio of 15.9, exceeding the historical high recorded in 1997; the income leverage ratio was 72.0%, significantly higher than the long-term average. Due to competitive mortgage plans offered by banks, mortgage rates slightly declined but rose slightly toward the end of the year in line with the increase in Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR). In the commercial property market, transaction volumes remained largely stable throughout the year. As non-residential property prices retreated from their 2015 peak, corresponding rental yields rose slightly compared to the previous year, though they remained low.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nIt is expected that real GDP growth in 2017 will remain moderate. The government forecasts economic growth to range between 2% and 3%, while private sector analysts predict an average increase of 2.0%. Externally, as global macroeconomic and financial conditions become increasingly uncertain, global economic and trade growth is likely to remain moderate. Additionally, the appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar's real effective exchange rate, driven by a strong US dollar, is expected to dampen Hong Kong's export performance. Locally, although stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, private consumption is anticipated to grow only modestly due to rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of multiple infrastructure projects, property and construction activities should grow steadily. However, a weak business climate and rising interest rates are likely to affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2017. On one hand, rising global commodity prices and increasing inflation in mainland China may push up import prices; on the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar could help mitigate these pressures. With moderate economic momentum, underlying cost pressures should remain manageable, though the rental component of the composite consumer price index may see a slight increase in inflation due to rising new residential rents at the beginning of 2017. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.0%. Although heightened uncertainties may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be subject to numerous uncertainties, particularly those stemming from the external environment. The policy uncertainties of the new U.S. administration will cloud the global economic outlook, and potential protectionist measures could also hinder global trade. The Brexit process and major elections in several European countries may also lead to volatility in asset markets and affect capital flows in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the normalization of U.S. interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and put downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market will remain tight, and its prospects remain highly uncertain. In the short term, however, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and developers offering incentives (such as discounts and cash rebates) that release accumulated purchasing power will support housing demand. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, the possibility of the U.S. accelerating interest rate hikes, and a steady increase in housing supply may continue to pose headwinds for the property market.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite economic headwinds and heightened market volatility stemming from unexpected outcomes of international political events, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2016. Authorized institutions maintained strong capital and liquidity positions, with asset quality showing a slight deterioration but still remaining at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest Rate Trends\n\nWith the rise in U.S. interest rates, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) significantly increased in November and December. The composite rate, which reflects the funding costs of retail banks in Hong Kong dollars, rose slightly (Figure 7).  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and fluency. Key strengths include:  \n- **Terminology:** Most translations correctly use \"interbank offered rates\" or \"HIBOR\" (e.g., translations 2, 4–6), which is critical for financial accuracy.  \n- **Clarity:** Translation 5 and 6 explicitly define \"composite rate\" with \"reflecting the funding costs of retail banks in Hong Kong dollars,\" which is more precise than \"cost of Hong Kong dollar funds\" (translation 1).  \n- **Tense and Flow:** Translation 3 and 5 use \"As U.S. interest rates rose\" and \"saw a slight increase,\" which are grammatically sound and natural.  \n**Weaknesses:**  \n- **Ambiguity:** Omitting \"HIBOR\" (e.g., translation 1) risks confusion, as \"interbank rates\" is a broad term.  \n- **Redundancy:** Phrases like \"the cost of Hong Kong dollar funds\" (translation 1) are less concise than \"funding costs in Hong Kong dollars\" (translation 5).  \n- **Nuance:** \"Rose only slightly\" (translation 6) adds emphasis on the minimal increase, which aligns with the original's \"輕微上升\" but may be overly cautious.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- **Specificity:** Explicitly name HIBOR for clarity.  \n- **Conciseness:** Use \"funding costs in Hong Kong dollars\" to avoid redundancy.  \n- **Natural Flow:** Opt for \"rose slightly\" (translation 1) for brevity while retaining the original's nuance.  \nThe final translation integrates these elements for accuracy, fluency, and precision.\n\nFigure 7: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, Composite Interest Rate, and Prime Lending Rate\n\nNotes:  \n1. The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (monthly average) is published by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.  \n2. The Prime Lending Rate (monthly average) is based on the rate reported by HSBC Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nRetail banking profitability improved slightly in 2016, with overall pre-tax operating profit from its Hong Kong operations rising by 8.7%. This growth was primarily driven by income from foreign exchange and derivatives trading (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), although partially offset by a decline in fee and commission income (-11.3%). Post-tax profit for retail banking increased by 44.4%, mainly attributable to non-recurring items. Consequently, the retail banking’s average return on assets after tax also rose from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Performance of Retail Banking\n\nThe net interest margin for retail banking in 2016 was 1.32%, the same as in 2015 (Figure 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate excess funds to lower-yielding but more liquid financial investments, the decline in interest income was offset by a reduction in interest expense.\n\nFigure 9: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\n\nNon-interest income from retail banking accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, remaining largely stable. Although fee and commission income declined by 11.3%, dividend income and income from foreign exchange and derivative transactions increased by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite fluctuations in the external environment and rising U.S. interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable in 2016. The Hong Kong money market continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity in the interbank sector. The linked exchange rate system continued to demonstrate high resilience to shocks, serving as the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, i.e., ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily employs a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; when the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must correspondingly increase or decrease, fully aligning with the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Certificates of liabilities (which fully back the banknotes issued by the three issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins  \n- The total reserves held in settlement accounts by banks with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balances)  \n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange rate guarantee. If market demand for Hong Kong dollars exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the exchange rate band of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of Hong Kong dollars, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing total reserves and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thus restoring the exchange rate to within the exchange rate band.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate behavior in 2016, emphasizing its narrow range after initial fluctuations, factors influencing its movement (e.g., interest rate differentials, market sentiment, geopolitical events), and the stability of the linked exchange rate system. The junior translations generally capture the content accurately but vary in terminology, fluency, and precision. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology**: Most translations use \"linked exchange rate system\" correctly, though Translation 2 incorrectly refers to a \"currency board system.\" The term \"negative interest rate differential\" (used in Translations 1, 3, 5) is more precise than \"interest rate differential\" (Translations 4, 6), as the original explicitly mentions \"負息差.\"\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**: Translations 3 and 6 exhibit smoother phrasing (e.g., \"remained within a narrow range\" vs. \"narrowly range-bound\"). However, phrases like \"supported by improved market sentiment\" (Translation 1) are slightly awkward compared to \"supported by improving market sentiment\" (Translation 6).\n3. **Cultural\/Contextual Nuance**: \"Brexit referendum\" (Translations 2, 3, 5, 6) is acceptable but \"UK referendum\" might be more neutral. \"Renminbi\" (Translations 4, 6) is correctly capitalized. The phrase \"general weakness of Asian currencies\" (Translations 1, 2, 5) is slightly vague compared to the original's \"普遍疲弱\" (general weakness).\n4. **Consistency**: Translations 1, 3, and 5 use \"demand for the Hong Kong dollar\" consistently, while Translation 5 mistakenly uses \"weakening demand\" instead of \"decline in demand.\"\n**Improvements**: Use \"linked exchange rate system\" with capitalization, clarify \"negative interest rate differential,\" ensure consistent phrasing (e.g., \"narrow range\"), and refine awkward constructions (e.g., \"supported by improving market sentiment\" instead of \"supported by improved market sentiment\").\n---\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced slight fluctuations in the first two months of 2016 before remaining within a narrow range for the rest of the year. The Hong Kong dollar significantly weakened against the US dollar at the beginning of 2016, falling from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Figure 1). This weakening aligned with the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve’s December 2015 interest rate hike. Additional market-related factors—including a sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, less optimistic economic outlooks for mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate, and the general weakness of Asian currencies—contributed to reduced demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improving market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened in February and remained within a narrow range of 7.753 to 7.776 from March onward, even as market volatility triggered by the UK referendum and the US presidential election had no significant impact. Due to expectations of a US interest rate hike in the summer, the Hong Kong dollar faced brief downward pressure in May. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1: 2016 Market Exchange Rates\n\nSince the exchange guarantee was not triggered, the total surplus and the aggregate amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds remained largely unchanged in 2016, staying around HKD 122.22 billion (Figure 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an additional HKD 132 billion in foreign exchange fund notes to meet the substantial liquidity management needs of banks, resulting in the total surplus decreasing to HKD 25.96 billion by the end of 2016. The issuance of additional foreign exchange fund notes aligns with the principles of the Currency Board System, as such issuance merely represents a transfer within the components of the monetary base—from the total surplus to outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds—while the monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.  \nSince the exchange guarantee was not triggered, the total surplus and the aggregate amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds remained largely unchanged in 2016, staying around HKD 122.22 billion (Figure 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an additional HKD 132 billion in foreign exchange fund notes to meet the substantial liquidity management needs of banks, resulting in the total surplus decreasing to HKD 25.96 billion by the end of 2016. The issuance of additional foreign exchange fund notes aligns with the principles of the Currency Board System, as such issuance merely represents a transfer within the components of the monetary base—from the total surplus to outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds—while the monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: Summary of Total Reserves and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds in 2016\n\n# Money Market\n\nHong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Figure 3). During January and February, HIBOR faced upward pressure due to heightened financial market volatility, but stabilized in March as the financial environment calmed. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns over the outcome of the UK’s Brexit referendum and reforms in U.S. money market funds, HIBOR remained largely stable. In the fourth quarter, HIBOR recorded a significant increase, partly due to year-end funding demand and the catch-up of Hong Kong dollar rates with the rise in U.S. dollar rates. Nevertheless, short-term HIBOR rates remained below the base rate throughout 2016.\n\nIn response to the U.S. Federal Funds Target Rate range being raised from 0.25% to 0.50% to 0.50% to 0.75% on December 14 (U.S. time), the basic interest rate was increased from 0.75% to 1.00% on December 15. The adjustment to the basic interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the higher of either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds Target Rate range or the average of the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR).\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) in 2016\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but vary in fluency, terminology, and precision. Key strengths include consistent use of \"interest rate differential\" and \"interbank liquidity,\" which are standard in financial contexts. However, weaknesses include redundancy (e.g., \"forward exchange rate points\" repeated unnecessarily), awkward phrasing (e.g., \"portfolio construction\"), and inconsistent terminology (e.g., \"monetary market\" vs. \"money market\"). The phrase \"discount window lending was not active\" is better than \"discount window borrowing was inactive,\" and \"involving only HKD 5.3 billion\" is more natural than \"totaling only HK$5.3 billion.\" The best version combines clarity, concision, and financial terminology accuracy.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe Hong Kong dollar forward premium widened significantly in January, largely tracking the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, and partially reflecting investors' demand for foreign exchange hedging of their Hong Kong equity portfolios (Figure 4). The forward premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions stabilized, the Hong Kong dollar forward points remained largely stable from March to November, before rising again in December due to the narrowing of the interest rate differential. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HKD 5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the Linked Exchange Rate System (Linked System) has remained the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past several decades. Market volatility intensified in early 2016, sparking renewed discussions about the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and comparisons to the Asian financial crisis period. To enhance public understanding of the Linked System, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) elaborated on its technical details and emphasized Hong Kong's financial system's capacity to withstand shocks. The government reiterated its firm commitment to maintaining the Linked System. Stability in foreign exchange and currency markets further solidified public confidence in the government's resolve to uphold the Linked System and in the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of exchange and store of value. During its annual Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) explicitly stated that the Linked System is the most suitable monetary regime for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and robust and effective financial regulation as the underpinnings of the system.\n\nFigure 4: 2016 USD\/HKD Forward Exchange Rate Points\n\nGiven that a sound banking system plays a critical role in the smooth functioning of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. It also strengthens oversight of banks' personal, corporate, and mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system's resilience against shocks. In light of the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) have begun to rise, prompting the HKMA to urge the public to remain vigilant and prepare for potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, a portion of its assets has been designated to support the monetary base since October 1998. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 106.7% as of December 31, 2016 (Figure 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Fund’s assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources provide a strong backstop for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.  \n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Terminology Consistency:** \"Exchange Fund\" is consistently used (not \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Fund’s assets\" without clarification).  \n2. **Proper Nouns:** \"Linked Exchange Rate System\" is capitalized as a formal system name.  \n3. **Precision:** \"Backstop\" (financial jargon) replaces \"buffer\" or \"safeguard\" for accuracy.  \n4. **Fluency:** Avoids redundancy (e.g., \"the entire assets\" → \"all of the Fund’s assets\").  \n5. **Clarity:** \"Support ratio\" and \"support portfolio\" maintain consistency with the original text.  \n6. **Cultural Appropriateness:** Reflects Hong Kong’s financial framework without overcomplicating terms.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Fluctuations in the Support Ratio in 2016\n\n# Research Work\n\nThe original text discusses the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, its 2016 agenda, and the availability of its records. Key translation challenges include accurate terminology (e.g., \"貨幣發行委員會\" vs. \"Monetary Policy Committee\"), structural clarity, and adherence to official HKMA nomenclature.  \n**Review of Junior Translations:**  \n1. **Terminology Errors:** Translations 1, 3, and 5 incorrectly use \"Monetary Policy Committee\" instead of \"Currency Board Committee,\" conflating distinct entities.  \n2. **Structural Inconsistencies:** Translations 1, 3, and 5 misplace the Currency Board Committee under the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which is inaccurate. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee operates independently.  \n3. **Vocabulary Precision:** \"Financial condition index\" (translations 2, 6) is more precise than \"financial situation index\" (translations 1, 3, 5).  \n4. **Cultural\/Institutional Accuracy:** Translations 2, 4, and 6 correctly reference the \"Currency Board System\" and specify that reports are submitted *to* the committee by the HKMA, aligning with institutional protocols.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Use \"Currency Board Committee\" consistently.  \n- Clarify the hierarchical relationship: the committee operates under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, not the HKMA.  \n- Employ \"financial condition index\" for accuracy.  \n- Specify that reports are submitted *to* the committee by the HKMA.  \n---\nThe Currency Board Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2016, the committee explored topics including the synchronization of economic growth between Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the United States, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and Hong Kong’s financial condition index. Minutes of the Currency Board Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Board system submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Financial Research Centre continues to support research in monetary policy, banking, and the financial sector. In 2016, the research centre invited a total of 18 scholars to visit and published 20 working papers.\n\nWithin the year, the Research Centre hosted six international conferences and seminars, primarily including:  \n- In January, the \"7th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy\" was held, with the theme \"China's Deepening Impact on the Global Economy.\" Eight research papers covering a wide range of topics were presented, including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the RMB on global and regional economies, and trends in interest rate differentials and information flows between RMB markets.  \n- In March, the \"Seminar on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics\" was co-hosted with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University, covering topics such as global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.  \n- In August, the \"Seminar on Real Estate and Financial Stability\" was co-hosted with the City University of Hong Kong, featuring papers on age, population, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamics of Hong Kong housing prices; housing affordability; the influence of mortgage regulations on household lifecycle home purchase decisions; and the residential property market in mainland China.  \n- In October, a seminar on the Asia-Pacific economic system was co-hosted with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements, with the theme \"Resilience of Regional Economic Systems in a Volatile Global Environment.\" The event attracted senior officials from multiple central banks, leading scholars, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who engaged in interactive roundtable discussions to exchange views on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system. Topics discussed included financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, spillover effects of mainland China's economic slowdown on other regions, and the impact on Asia's potential growth and outlook.  \nWithin the year, the Research Centre hosted six international conferences and seminars, primarily including:  \n- In January, the \"7th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy\" was held, with the theme \"China's Deepening Impact on the Global Economy.\" Eight research papers covering a wide range of topics were presented, including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the RMB on global and regional economies, and trends in interest rate differentials and information flows between RMB markets.  \n- In March, the \"Seminar on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics\" was co-hosted with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University, covering topics such as global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.  \n- In August, the \"Seminar on Real Estate and Financial Stability\" was co-hosted with the City University of Hong Kong, featuring papers on age, population, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamics of Hong Kong housing prices; housing affordability; the influence of mortgage regulations on household lifecycle home purchase decisions; and the residential property market in mainland China.  \n- In October, a seminar on the Asia-Pacific economic system was co-hosted with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements, with the theme \"Resilience of Regional Economic Systems in a Volatile Global Environment.\" The event attracted senior officials from multiple central banks, leading scholars, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who engaged in interactive roundtable discussions to exchange views on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system. Topics discussed included financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, spillover effects of mainland China's economic slowdown on other regions, and the impact on Asia's potential growth and outlook.\n\nThe Research Center also held the \"14th Annual Summer Conference\" in August and the \"14th China Mainland Economic Conference\" in September, discussing the asset quality and financial stability of mainland banks. These conferences attracted participation from academia, the financial services sector, and representatives from central banks around the world. Throughout the year, the Research Center also organized 21 public small-scale seminars, exploring a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial topics.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 407.8 billion, representing a 13.2% increase compared to the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the Government was HKD 11.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 9 and 10). Among the Government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of HKD 10 banknotes in circulation was HKD 4.4 billion, of which 86% were polymer banknotes.  \nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 407.8 billion, representing a 13.2% increase compared to the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8).

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\nThe original text \"銀行體系穩定\" is a noun phrase emphasizing the stability of the banking system. The junior translations exhibit several issues:  \n1. **Capitalization**: \"Banking system stability\" (lowercase) and \"Banking system stable.\" (incorrect adjective use) lack proper title case.  \n2. **Hashtags**: \"#BankingSystemStable\" and \"# Banking System Stability\" are informal and contextually inappropriate for a formal statement.  \n3. **Grammar\/Vocabulary**: \"Banking system stable.\" incorrectly uses an adjective instead of the noun \"stability.\"  \nThe best approach is to use title case (\"Banking System Stability\") without hashtags, ensuring grammatical accuracy and formal tone.\n\nDespite increased global market risks and volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2016. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) enhanced its regulatory oversight of authorized institutions' risk governance frameworks and the effectiveness of their credit and liquidity risk management systems throughout the year. In light of the rising frequency of cyberattacks, the HKMA also strengthened its supervision of authorized institutions' cyber risk management practices. Aligning with its commitment to combating financial crime, the effectiveness of authorized institutions' measures to monitor money laundering and terrorist financing remained a key focus of the HKMA's regulatory efforts. Regarding the conduct of authorized institutions, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, advance financial inclusion, and address challenges faced by overseas small and medium-sized enterprises and startups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also reinforced its regulatory oversight of the methods used by authorized institutions to sell investment and insurance products, further enhancing customer protection.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in preparing for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards, including the net stable funding ratio, large exposure limits, IFRS 9, and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 188 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its engagement with the boards of directors of authorized institutions to enhance risk governance and corporate culture within the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with boards or their committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors (INEDs) to exchange views on matters related to corporate culture and risk governance. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the remuneration systems of authorized institutions were conducive to effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reviews the capital plans of authorized institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, to prepare for the full implementation of Basel III's buffer capital requirements in 2019. Solvency stress tests for authorized institutions have also been improved in line with the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also carefully assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides recommendations on areas needing improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to conduct thematic assessments in conjunction with regular on-site inspections, with thematic assessments primarily applied to categories assessed as higher risk. This regulatory approach enables the HKMA to more effectively allocate supervisory resources to address emerging and significant risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic assessments. The focus of these inspections and assessments remained on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly credit risks related to mainland China operations; another key focus was measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the frequency of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity risk, operational risk, and technology risk management. During the year, specialized inspection teams conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 presents a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2016.\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nBank lending grew moderately in 2016. The total outstanding loan balance increased by 6.5% for the year, compared to a 3.5% increase in 2015 (Table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth in Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of related loans in the mainland increased by 7% to HKD 356.4 billion by the end of 2016 (Table 3), including HKD 54.5 billion in loans accounted for by subsidiaries of banks registered in Hong Kong operating on the mainland.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained robust in 2016. Although the specific non-performing loan ratio for retail banks rose slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained significantly below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the specific non-performing loan ratio for the overall banking sector increased from 0.73% to 0.85%. The asset quality of mainland-related loans within the banking sector followed a similar trend during the year; concurrently, the specific non-performing loan ratio for these loans in retail banking rose slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, while the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also increased slightly from 0.77% to 0.80% year-on-year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has invested significant regulatory resources to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. During the regulatory process, the HKMA has given particular attention to the increasing risk exposure of authorized institutions toward private enterprises in Mainland China, as well as the credit risks arising from investments in debt securities aimed at boosting returns. Additionally, the HKMA has conducted a special assessment of the credit risk management practices of authorized institutions regarding the distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Real Estate Mortgage Loan\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor the property loan activities of authorized institutions. Residential property prices began to decline in September 2015 but rebounded in March 2016, rising by 8% year-on-year. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans decreased from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical property loan measures, to 51% by December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio for new residential mortgage loans also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the HKMA first introduced a cap on debt-to-income ratios, to 34% by December 2016 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for New Residential Property Mortgages  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced a debt-to-income ratio cap prior to implementing the first round of countercyclical measures for property loans.\n\nAccording to the seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in February 2015, authorized institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements must extend the application of the 15% credit risk-weighted asset floor from newly originated mortgage loans to their entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This provision came into effect in June 2016.\n\nMore property developers are offering mortgages directly to property buyers this year, with loan-to-value ratios often exceeding the levels permitted under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) prudential requirements for authorized institutions. The HKMA is closely monitoring this development and regularly communicating with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage their risk exposure to property developers. In addition, at the HKMA’s request, the Land Registry has agreed to provide an electronic alert service to authorized institutions. When an authorized institution uses this service, it will receive an electronic alert from the Land Registry whenever other mortgage documents for properties it has mortgaged are submitted for registration. This service helps address situations where mortgage borrowers take out additional mortgages on the same property without prior approval from the mortgagee institution. The Land Registry introduced the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nLike other international financial centers, Hong Kong faces increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber threats. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) received reports from authorized institutions regarding unauthorized stock trading and attempts to infiltrate their payment systems, and promptly took action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued alerts on electronic banking services, warning the public to be vigilant against online stock trading scams and advising them to take preventive measures. It also issued notices to authorized institutions, providing guidance on security measures that could be adopted to further strengthen monitoring of online banking services. Regarding cases of attempted infiltration of banking payment systems, the HKMA had already alerted authorized institutions to be vigilant about such scams upon first discovering similar cases in Hong Kong. With the assistance of the police, the HKMA explained the methods used by the perpetrators and required authorized institutions to take these methods into account when enhancing monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the banking system's resilience against cyber risks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Cyber Defence Programme in May 2016. This programme comprises three pillars: the Cyber Defence Assessment Framework, the Professional Training Programme, and the Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform (see the \"Office for Fintech Promotion\" section under the \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\" chapter). In December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a notice to licensed institutions detailing the implementation timeline of the Cyber Defence Assessment Framework.\n\nThe six translations generally capture the original text's content accurately, with minor variations in phrasing and terminology. Strengths include consistent use of key terms like \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox\" and \"biometric authentication,\" as well as clear explanations of the HKMA's initiatives. However, weaknesses include inconsistent capitalization of \"Fintech\" (some use \"FinTech,\" others \"fintech\"), occasional redundancy (e.g., \"allowing for appropriate adjustments\" vs. \"enabling necessary modifications\"), and minor deviations from the original's formal tone (e.g., \"micropayments\" instead of \"small-value payments\"). The use of \"HK$\" vs. \"HKD\" and phrasing like \"to meet the growing demand\" vs. \"in response to the growing demand\" also vary slightly. The best version would integrate the most precise terminology, maintain formal consistency, and ensure clarity in technical descriptions.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe application of financial technology in the banking sector made significant progress in 2016, with multiple authorized institutions launching new fintech products. Particularly notable developments occurred in personal small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication. In September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox,\" enabling authorized institutions to test their fintech initiatives in a controlled environment without fully complying with the HKMA's regulatory requirements. This arrangement allows institutions to collect real-world data and user feedback early on, enabling necessary modifications before officially launching fintech services. By the end of 2016, six applications for using the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox had been approved, with new fintech products involving biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain technology for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also raised the transaction limit for online banking personal small-value payment services that do not require dual authentication to HK$5,000 per account per day, in response to the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, multiple property-related fraud cases occurred, involving fraudsters impersonating property owners to attempt profiting through mortgage loan applications or property sales. Although these fraud cases did not involve authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely collaborated with the police and the Hong Kong Banking Association (Banking Association) to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing such fraud within the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the \"Operational Incident Communications\" to share lessons learned from operational incidents that had occurred at authorized institutions. The HKMA also conducted on-site reviews and thematic assessments of authorized institutions' business operational risk management systems, fraud management practices, trust\/custody operations, and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent unauthorized or non-compliant transaction activities.\n\n# Regulation of Financial Activities and Liquidity Risk\n\nSeveral major political events occurred in 2016, leading to significant fluctuations in financial markets throughout the year. At the same time, U.S. interest rates continued to normalize gradually, and the Federal Open Market Committee decided in December to raise the federal funds rate, marking the second increase since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these political events, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to maintain close communication with overseas regulatory authorities, assessing the impact of these events on the Hong Kong banking system and requiring banks to remain vigilant and strengthen their risk management to address adverse market developments.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducts additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system's ability to withstand potentially severe stress scenarios and follows up with authorized institutions to enhance their capacity to respond. Following a round of on-site reviews on interest rate risk management conducted in 2015, the HKMA carried out further on-site reviews to evaluate the market risk management of authorized institutions and required those with inadequate monitoring to implement corrective actions.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Activities\nThe original Chinese title emphasizes both \"money laundering\" and \"terrorist fundraising activities.\" While all translations capture the core concepts, several issues arise:\n1. **\"Terrorist Fundraising\" vs. \"Terrorist Financing\"**: \"Fundraising\" is a literal translation of \"籌集\" but \"financing\" is the standard term in anti-money laundering\/counter-terrorism contexts (e.g., FATF guidelines). \"Financing\" better reflects the systemic nature of illicit financial flows.\n2. **\"Activities\" vs. omission**: The original explicitly includes \"活動\" (activities), which should be retained for completeness. Omitting it risks losing the nuance that these are specific actions to be combated.\n3. **Verb choice**: \"Combat\" (transitive) vs. \"Combating\" (gerund). While both are acceptable, \"Combating\" is more natural in formal titles, aligning with common usage in policy documents (e.g., \"Combating Corruption\").\n4. **Article usage**: \"the Financing of Terrorism\" is grammatically correct but less direct than \"Terrorist Financing,\" which is more concise and widely recognized in regulatory frameworks.\nThe best translation balances fidelity to the original with natural English phrasing, using standard terminology while preserving the structural emphasis on \"activities.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) risk-based anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) supervision encompasses on-site and off-site reviews (including regulatory liaison with authorized institutions regarding specific matters), primarily targeting sectors with elevated risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. These reviews assess authorized institutions' evaluations of AML\/CTF risks, the implementation of risk-based approaches, and the systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, HKMA's specialized regulatory staff conducted 17 on-site reviews and 30 off-site reviews.\n\nIn terms of policy development, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) prioritizes addressing difficulties encountered by certain industries and individuals in opening bank accounts, and issues guidelines and \"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\" to clarify specific customer due diligence requirements, as well as the HKMA’s regulatory expectations regarding the risk-based approach. At the same time, the HKMA continues to work closely with industry associations to issue guidance to assist authorized institutions in managing risks in specific areas, such as trade-related money laundering activities.\n"}

Last year's tax reforms helped create a favorable environment to attract multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing center and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office during the year. The HKMA issued 13 licenses to issuers of stored value payment tools during the year. Hong Kong's sound fiscal performance and substantial net foreign assets continue to be confirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor's maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2016, global offshore RMB business slowed due to fluctuations in global financial markets and uncertainties surrounding the RMB exchange rate outlook. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as the global hub for offshore RMB business, processing approximately 70% of global RMB payment transactions. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect mechanism in December marked another milestone in China's capital account opening and represented an important step in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding RMB liquidity support and implementing measures to enhance transparency in the RMB market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders and to develop Hong Kong into a hub for infrastructure financing. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully facilitated the passage of legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetries and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, thereby creating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing. Notably, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world’s third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the fund’s only office located outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) positively evaluated our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center during last year’s Article IV consultation discussions. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participated in international discussions, striving to promote global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, and this work helped secure affirmation of Hong Kong’s credit ratings from major rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe and effective operation and sustained development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure play a crucial role in reinforcing its competitiveness as an international financial center and a global offshore RMB business hub. In 2016, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions and the Central Moneymarket Unit (CMU) system for debt instruments achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.  \nThe safe and effective operation and sustained development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure play a crucial role in reinforcing its competitiveness as an international financial center and a global offshore RMB business hub.

During the year, a total of 13 stored value payment tool licenses were issued under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"), which came into full effect in November 2016. The coverage of electronic cheque services was also expanded to include cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of fintech in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Promotion Office in March. Several important measures implemented during the year have achieved notable progress.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced a series of measures to enhance the soft power of the banking industry, including (i) launching a program to improve the professional capabilities of directors; (ii) establishing an overall professional qualification framework for banking professionals across the industry; and (iii) implementing a consumer education program.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Offshore RMB Business\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, numerical formatting, and stylistic choices. Key observations include:\n1. **Numerical Formatting**: Several translations use \"RMB 625.1 billion\" (e.g., Translation 1), while others use \"625.1 billion RMB\" (e.g., Translation 3). The latter is more natural in English, aligning with standard financial reporting conventions.\n2. **Terminology**: \"RTGS system\" is correctly used in most translations, but \"Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system\" (Translation 2) provides clarity on first mention. Similarly, \"liquidity pool\" (Translation 1) is more precise than \"capital pool\" (Translation 3) in describing the RMB funding context.\n3. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"RMB deposits and deposit certificates held by RMB customers\" (Translation 4) are redundant; \"RMB customer deposits and deposit certificates\" is more concise.\n4. **Numerical Errors**: Translation 6 contains critical errors (e.g., \"45,421 billion RMB\" instead of \"4.5421 trillion RMB\") that must be corrected.\n5. **Flow and Precision**: Translations 1–5 maintain a logical flow, but some could benefit from tighter phrasing (e.g., \"a slowdown in offshore RMB business\" vs. \"a slowdown in global offshore RMB business\" in Translation 3).\n**Improved Translation**:  \nFluctuations in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the RMB exchange rate outlook in 2016 led to a slowdown in global offshore RMB business. By year-end, the combined balance of RMB customer deposits and deposit certificates in Hong Kong totaled RMB 625.1 billion, a 38% decrease compared to the previous year (Figure 1). Offshore RMB bond issuance during the year fell to RMB 52.8 billion, while the value of RMB trade settlements processed by Hong Kong banks declined to RMB 4.5421 trillion. On the other hand, Hong Kong banks’ RMB loan balance at year-end remained roughly unchanged at RMB 294.8 billion (Figure 2). Transaction volumes on the RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system stayed high, averaging RMB 863.6 billion daily in 2016. This indicates that despite a reduction in the RMB liquidity pool, Hong Kong continues to support substantial RMB financial intermediation activities. According to SWIFT statistics, Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of global RMB payment transactions in 2016, underscoring its role as the global hub for offshore RMB business.  \n**Final Translation**:  \nFluctuations in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the RMB exchange rate outlook in 2016 led to a slowdown in global offshore RMB business.

Several new measures were introduced, including further opening up the mainland’s interbank bond and foreign exchange markets, as well as launching the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" in December. In response to growing demand for liquidity management in expanding cross-border investment channels and markets, the HKMA expanded its RMB liquidity arrangements. In October, the number of primary liquidity providers under the program was increased from seven to nine, and the total quota was raised from RMB 14 billion to RMB 18 billion. The HKMA also enhanced transparency in the usage of its RMB liquidity arrangements, enabling participating banks to more effectively manage their liquidity needs.  \nThe translations generally capture the core content but exhibit inconsistencies in terminology, numerical accuracy, and phrasing. Key issues include:  \n1. **Numerical Errors**: Several translations incorrectly state \"140 billion RMB\" instead of the original \"140 billion\" (likely a typo in the source text, but the correct figure is 14 billion).  \n2. **Terminology**: \"Mutual Market Access\" (used in Translation 3) is not the official term for \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect.\"  \n3. **Fluency**: Phrases like \"liquidity management through cross-border investment channels and markets\" (Translation 4) are awkwardly worded.  \n4. **Redundancy**: \"RMB-related business\" (Translation 2) and \"RMB liquidity arrangement usage\" (Translation 5) are unnecessarily verbose.  \nImprovements focus on precise terminology, numerical accuracy, and concise phrasing to ensure clarity and professionalism.  \nThe final translation above integrates the best elements while addressing these issues.\n\nThe national \"13th Five-Year Plan\" announced in March reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a global offshore RMB business hub, demonstrating the central government's support for Hong Kong's further development of offshore RMB business.  \nThe translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in phrasing and formality. Key observations:  \n1. **\"Position\" vs. \"status\"**: \"Status\" (used in translations 3, 5, 6) is more formal and appropriate for official documents, while \"position\" (translations 1, 2, 4) is slightly less precise.  \n2. **\"Business hub\" vs. \"hub\"**: Including \"business\" clarifies the context (translations 1, 2, 3, 5), while omitting it (translations 4, 6) risks ambiguity.  \n3. **Verb tense**: Translations 1–5 use past tense (\"affirmed,\" \"reaffirmed\"), aligning with the original's reference to a March announcement. Translation 6 uses present tense (\"reaffirms\"), which is inconsistent.  \n4. **\"Operations\" vs. \"business\"**: \"Business\" (translations 1–5) is more precise than \"operations\" (translation 6).  \n5. **\"Thirteenth\" vs. \"13th\"**: \"13th\" (translations 1–5) is standard in English for numerical designations, while \"Thirteenth\" (translation 4) is less common in this context.  \nThe optimal translation balances formality, clarity, and grammatical accuracy, retaining \"status,\" \"business hub,\" and past tense while avoiding redundancy.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore RMB business. The HKMA also actively participates in various activities to promote Hong Kong as a global offshore RMB business hub and a key springboard for China's \"going global\" strategy, including participation in local events organized by industry groups and private institutions, as well as overseas events in mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Arrangement Between Mainland China and Hong Kong on Establishing a Closer Economic and Trade Relationship\nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in formality, precision, and adherence to the original structure. Key observations:  \n1. **\"Mainland China\" vs. \"the Mainland\"**: \"Mainland China\" is more precise and avoids ambiguity, as \"the Mainland\" could be interpreted as a geographic region rather than a political entity.  \n2. **\"Relationship\" vs. \"Relations\"**: \"Relationship\" aligns better with the original Chinese term (關係), which emphasizes a dynamic, ongoing connection rather than a static set of relations.  \n3. **\"Arrangement\" vs. \"Arrangements\"**: The original uses 協議 (agreement\/arrangement), singular, so \"Arrangement\" is more accurate than \"Arrangements.\"  \n4. **\"Closer Economic and Trade Relationship\"**: This phrase is direct and matches the original's focus on economic and trade ties. The fifth translation's addition of \"Partnership Arrangements\" introduces an inaccuracy not present in the source text.  \n5. **Capitalization and Style**: Consistent capitalization of key terms (e.g., \"Closer Economic and Trade Relationship\") enhances formality, suitable for an official title.  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, formality, and fidelity to the original, avoiding unnecessary additions or stylistic deviations.\n\nUnder the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between the Mainland and Hong Kong, a new agreement marking the basic realization of service trade liberalization between the two regions was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the current arrangement and collaborates with government authorities to explore further measures to expand market access and facilitate Hong Kong's financial sector in the Mainland market.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Promotion Office (IFFO)\n\n# IFFO's Mission\n\nIFFO’s mission is to foster infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions include:  \n- Providing a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;  \n- Enhancing skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;  \n- Promoting market and product development;  \n- And facilitating infrastructure investment and financing activities.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations are largely accurate but vary in fluency and consistency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Verb Choice:** \"Promote\" (used in most translations) is generic; \"foster\" (used in Translation 5) better conveys nurturing growth, while \"facilitate\" (used in Translations 3–5) aligns with the functional role of enabling activities.  \n2. **Parallel Structure:** Translations 1 and 2 use inconsistent verb forms (\"providing,\" \"enhancing,\" \"promoting,\" \"and promoting\"), while Translations 3–6 use \"to provide,\" \"to enhance,\" etc., which is grammatically consistent.  \n3. **Redundancy:** Repeating \"infrastructure investment and financing\" in all bullet points is acceptable for clarity but could be streamlined.  \n4. **Cultural Nuance:** \"Foster\" and \"facilitate\" are more precise than \"promote\" in formal institutional contexts.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nIFFO’s mission is to foster infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions include:  \n- Providing a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;  \n- Enhancing skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;  \n- Promoting market and product development;  \n- And facilitating infrastructure investment and financing activities.  \nIFFO’s mission is to foster infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions include:  \n- Providing a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;  \n- Enhancing skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;  \n- Promoting market and product development;  \n- And facilitating infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (seventh from the left), toasted with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July, with a mission to promote infrastructure investment and financing through collaboration among key stakeholders. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public sector institutional investors, private sector institutional investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project developers and operators, professional service firms, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made significant progress since its establishment. To enhance professional skills, IFFO co-hosted an executive workshop in October with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, and Hanwha Investment & Securities, focusing on \"Private Capital Participation in Infrastructure Financing Projects in Emerging Markets.\" The workshop received very positive feedback from participants, contributing to knowledge enhancement and network building. In November, IFFO also held a high-level seminar, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to deliver a speech and share his experience in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the IFC and the Global Infrastructure Hub to establish a framework for cooperation. In December, IFFO signed MOUs with the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Bank through the IFFO platform to promote infrastructure financing for these banks. These activities have helped strengthen Hong Kong's position and international reputation as an infrastructure financing center.\n\nMr. Chen Delin, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (front left), and Mr. Philippe Le Roux, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the International Finance Corporation (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to foster collaboration in leveraging the IFFO platform, creating a more efficient and favorable market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (front left), and Mr. Chris Heathcote, Chief Executive Officer of the Global Infrastructure Centre (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework and facilitate infrastructure project financing.\n\nThe original text describes a signing ceremony between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Governor Chen Delin and China Development Bank Chairman Hu Huaiwang. The junior translations exhibit several critical issues:\n**Strengths:**  \n- All translations correctly identify the key entities (HKMA, China Development Bank) and the document type (Memorandum of Understanding).  \n- Most translations use appropriate formal tone and structure for official announcements.  \n**Weaknesses:**  \n1. **Name Accuracy:**  \n   - Translators 1, 3, and 5 incorrectly use \"Chen Der-lin,\" \"Eddie Yue,\" or \"Chan Tak-lun\" for Chen Delin. The correct romanization is **Chen Delin** (or **Chen Tak-lam** in some official contexts).  \n   - Translator 6 misspells Hu Huaiwang as \"Hu Huaiwang\" (extra \"g\").  \n2. **Title Precision:**  \n   - Translators 1, 3, and 4 use \"Chief Executive\" or \"Governor\" for the HKMA head. While both terms are sometimes used interchangeably, **\"Governor\"** is the official title for the HKMA’s head.  \n   - Translators 1 incorrectly refer to the HKMA as the \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" which is a distinct entity.  \n3. **Cultural\/Contextual Nuance:**  \n   - Translators 6 and 3 use \"their collaboration\" and \"sign\" (present tense), which are less precise than specifying \"between the bank and the HKMA\" and using past tense (\"signed\").  \n4. **Consistency:**  \n   - Translators 1–6 use inconsistent romanizations for names and titles, undermining professionalism.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Standardize the name as **Chen Delin** (or **Chen Tak-lam** if official documents use this variant).  \n- Use **\"Governor\"** for the HKMA head and **\"Chairman\"** for the China Development Bank.  \n- Ensure the full name of the HKMA is used (not abbreviated as \"FSC\" or \"HKMA\" without context).  \n- Maintain past tense (\"signed\") and specify the entities involved in the collaboration.  \n**Final Translation:**  \nGovernor Chen Delin of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left) and Chairman Hu Huaiwang of the China Development Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Corporate Treasury Center\nThe original term \"企業財資中心\" combines \"企業\" (enterprise\/corporate), \"財資\" (financial capital\/assets), and \"中心\" (center\/hub). The junior translations show varying degrees of accuracy:\n1. **Strengths**: Most translations correctly identify \"Treasury\" as the core term for \"財資,\" which is standard in financial contexts. \"Corporate\" is more precise than \"Enterprise\" for business entities. \n2. **Weaknesses**: \"Financial Hub\" (Translation 3) and \"Financial Capital Center\" (Translation 5) are less precise, as \"hub\" implies a network node rather than a centralized financial function. \"Enterprise\" (Translations 2 and 5) is acceptable but less common than \"Corporate\" in formal titles. \n**Improvements**: \"Corporate Treasury Center\" (Translations 1, 4, 6) is the most accurate, concise, and culturally appropriate, aligning with standard business terminology. It avoids redundancy and maintains clarity.\n\nTo further attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborated with the government to create a favorable tax environment for such centers. Specifically, the Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (the \"Amendment Ordinance\"), passed in June, allows companies to deduct interest expenses incurred in operating internal financing activities within their group when calculating profits tax, provided they meet specified conditions. Additionally, it provides a 50% reduction in profits tax (reducing the effective rate to 8.25%) on profits derived from specified treasury activities of eligible corporate treasury centers. Table 2 summarizes key points of the Amendment Ordinance.\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively promoted the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong to multinational and mainland Chinese enterprises. By the end of the year, the HKMA had engaged with nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organizations. In November, the HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong China Enterprise Association to assist Hong Kong's Chinese enterprises in better understanding and making fuller use of the HKMA's corporate treasury center platform.\n\n# Promote Asset Management Services\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote Hong Kong as a global asset management center. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management reached 1,300 by the end of 2016, representing an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. According to the Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity fund companies operating in Hong Kong (including both SFC-licensed entities and non-SFC-licensed entities) also rose by 4.6% in 2016, reaching 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world's top 100 asset management companies, as well as the majority of China's top 20 mutual fund companies, have established operations or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with operations based in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world's third-largest sovereign wealth fund, which announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong—the only office outside of Abu Dhabi set up by the institution.\n\n# Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Corporate Structure\nThe translations exhibit minor variations in terminology and formatting. The most critical distinction lies in \"基金型公司結構\" – while \"fund company structure\" is technically accurate, \"corporate structure\" better aligns with formal financial terminology. The use of \"mutual fund\" (Translation 2) introduces unnecessary specificity, as \"open-ended fund\" is the standard term in this context. Translation 6's \"investment company structure\" misrepresents the original meaning. Capitalization consistency (Translation 3's lowercase \"open-ended\") and hashtag retention (Translation 4) also warrant consideration. The optimal translation balances precision with formal financial terminology while preserving the original's structural elements.\n\nTo attract fund registrations in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with the government and industry to foster a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the 2016 Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill was passed, introducing an open-ended fund company structure. This diversifies Hong Kong’s fund registration platform and creates a more flexible operating environment for fund managers, thereby enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international asset management center.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) remains committed to enhancing market awareness and understanding of Islamic finance, including co-organizing and participating in Islamic finance seminars and workshops with industry associations, as well as sharing experiences in issuing Islamic bonds with market participants to encourage their use of Hong Kong as a platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two tranches of Islamic bonds, the HKMA has maintained close collaboration with the Government to launch a third tranche when market conditions are favorable.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2016年）\n\n1. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。\n2. 綜合消費物價指數以2014\/2015年為基期的數列計算。\n\n表2 外匯基金投資回報率：以港元計\n\n1. 2001至2003年的投資回報率以美元計。2. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。3. 不同年期的平均數以複合年度方式計算。\n\n表3 外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重（包括遠期交易）\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2016 was a year filled with surprises and black swan events, marked by significant volatility in global financial markets. Early in the year, concerns over a hard landing in mainland China's economy and a slowdown in global growth triggered sharp declines in global stock markets. The unexpected outcomes of the UK's Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November further heightened uncertainty. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to enhance the resilience of the Foreign Exchange Fund. As a result, the Fund still achieved an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary, who invests it in securities or other assets deemed appropriate after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but vary in fluency, consistency, and precision. Key observations:  \n- **Verb choice**: \"Preserve,\" \"safeguard,\" and \"protect\" are all acceptable for \"保障資本,\" but \"preserve\" aligns better with financial terminology.  \n- **Tense and voice**: \"Has set\" (Translation 2) and \"establishes\" (Translation 5) are more natural than \"shall determine\" (Translation 1).  \n- **Redundancy**: \"At all times\" and \"always\" (Translations 2, 6) are redundant; \"at all times\" is preferable for formality.  \n- **Terminology**: \"U.S. dollar assets\" (Translations 2, 3, 4) is precise, while \"U.S. assets\" (Translation 6) is vague.  \n- **Consistency**: Infinitives (\"to preserve,\" \"to ensure\") (Translations 2, 4) are more consistent with the original's imperative tone than gerunds (\"Preservation of capital\") (Translations 1, 3, 5).  \n- **Cultural nuance**: \"Maintain monetary and financial stability\" (Translations 2, 4) is standard in financial contexts, while \"preserve\" (Translation 5) is less idiomatic.  \n**Improved translation**:  \nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:  \n(a) To preserve capital;  \n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;  \n(c) To ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) To seek investment returns as far as possible, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.  \nThe translation prioritizes active voice, consistent infinitive structure, precise terminology, and idiomatic financial phrasing while adhering to the original’s formal tone.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full backing for the monetary base in accordance with the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in bond and stock markets of OECD member countries, aiming to preserve asset value and long-term purchasing power. The long-term target allocation ratio of bonds and stocks across these two portfolios is 71:29. In terms of target currency composition, 91% of assets are allocated to U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually diversified part of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Foreign Exchange Fund's accumulated surplus, but there is room for this cap to increase as part of future fund allocations are directed toward long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for the Exchange Fund's account for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Exchange Fund's investment performance assessment does not include this portfolio.\n\n#Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for Future Fund deposits. Interest rates on Future Fund deposits are linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the weighting of the portfolios. As of the end of 2016, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the investment benchmark, indicates the optimal long-term asset distribution the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide to implement tactical asset allocation in pursuit of returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, the actual distribution often deviates from the benchmark distribution (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark distributions is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and the limits for tactical deviation after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation. Portfolio managers can select holdings within the limits of tactical deviation to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Reserve Management Department directly manages approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio invests in global fixed-income markets and implements the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 26% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, enabling the Fund to benefit from diversified investment strategies while allowing internal professionals to gain market insights and knowledge.\n\nThe original text outlines expenses related to external investment managers and their annual variability due to market factors. The junior translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, phrasing, and redundancy. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology**: \"Transaction costs\" (used in translations 1, 6) and \"transaction fees\" (translations 2, 3, 5) are both acceptable, but \"transaction fees\" better aligns with financial industry jargon. \"Withholding tax\" (translation 4) is singular, whereas the original likely refers to multiple taxes (\"withholding taxes\" in translations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6).\n2. **Fluency and Redundancy**: Phrases like \"primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year\" (translation 3) or \"primarily subject to market factors and vary annually\" (translation 6) repeat the idea of market influence and annual variation, creating redundancy. The original text links these concepts sequentially: expenses are *mainly influenced by market factors* and *vary annually*.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are neutral and professional, but \"engaging an externally hired investment manager\" (translation 4) is unnecessarily verbose compared to \"hiring external investment managers\" (used in translations 1–3, 5, 6).\n**Improved Translation**:  \nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary annually, primarily due to market factors.  \nThis version maintains precise terminology, avoids redundancy, and mirrors the original’s logical flow.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" (the \"Principles\") issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on March 7, 2016. The Principles are voluntary and aim to help investors determine how best to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In the context of managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers appointed to manage Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles when managing these investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, underscoring the critical importance of risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, closely monitoring compliance with these guidelines and regulations. Additionally, the HKMA employs risk management tools to assess market risks under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. It also conducts detailed factor analysis of investment performance to maximize the effective utilization of investment management expertise from both internal and external managers.  \nThe translations generally capture the core message but exhibit minor inconsistencies. Key improvements include:  \n1. **Consistency in terminology**: Using \"HKMA\" uniformly instead of \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" (Translation 3) or alternating between \"HKMA\" and \"the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (Translation 1).  \n2. **Pluralization**: Correcting \"financial market\" to \"financial markets\" for grammatical accuracy (Translation 1).  \n3. **Verb choice**: Preferring active phrasing like \"maximize the effective utilization\" (Translation 6) over passive constructions.  \n4. **Nuance**: Using \"underscoring\" (Translation 2) or \"underscoring the critical importance\" (improved version) to emphasize the connection between volatility and risk management.  \n5. **Conciseness**: Streamlining phrases like \"detailed factor analysis of investment performance\" (Translation 1) instead of \"detailed analysis of investment performance factors\" (Translation 3).  \nThe final translation integrates these refinements for clarity, fluency, and precision.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2016\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced significant volatility. In the stock market, January concerns about a hard landing in mainland China's economy and a global growth slowdown led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major markets, which stabilized only by mid-February. The unexpected outcomes of the UK's Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November initially caused brief downturns, but markets quickly recovered. Overall, global stock markets generally performed well throughout the year.\n\nIn the bond market, further declines in commodity prices during the first quarter deepened concerns about slowing global growth and low inflation. Coupled with uncertainties arising from the UK's Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations that central banks would maintain accommodative policies, demand for safe-haven assets surged, supporting strong performance in government bond markets during the first half of 2016. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, rising market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, particularly after the U.S. presidential election, caused U.S. Treasury yields to surge. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, but by smaller margins.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the U.S. Dollar Index rising to a 14-year high. This sustained strength was driven by widening interest rate differentials between the dollar and other major currencies. While the Japanese yen appreciated approximately 3% against the dollar in 2016, the euro depreciated roughly 3% against the dollar. Amidst ongoing uncertainty stemming from the Brexit referendum results, the British pound fell 16% against the dollar during the year, marking its largest decline since 2008.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1: 2016 Market Returns  \nStock market performance is calculated based on index price changes during the year.\nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but exhibit minor inconsistencies in phrasing and precision. Key issues include:  \n1. **\"Year-end\" vs. \"during the year\"**: Translators 1 and 5 incorrectly used \"year-end,\" which implies end-of-year data rather than the full annual period specified by \"年內.\"  \n2. **\"Index price changes\" vs. \"changes in the index price\"**: Translators 3 and 4 used \"the change in index prices\" or \"changes in the index price,\" which grammatically implies a singular entity (the index) rather than plural price movements. The original explicitly refers to \"指數價格變動\" (plural price changes).  \n3. **Fluency and structure**: Translators 2 and 6 used \"during the year\" and \"within the year,\" both acceptable, but \"during the year\" is more natural in financial contexts.  \nThe optimal translation balances accuracy with natural phrasing, using \"index price changes during the year\" to reflect the original's plural emphasis and temporal scope. The table title is standardized as \"Table 1: 2016 Market Returns\" for consistency with common financial reporting conventions.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant fluctuations in financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 68.1 billion in 2016, comprising HKD 28.6 billion from overseas equities, HKD 5.3 billion from Hong Kong equities, HKD 33.1 billion from bonds, HKD 16.9 billion from other investments held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund Investment Holdings, and a HKD 15.8 billion decrease in foreign exchange valuation adjustments for non-HKD assets. This decrease was inevitable due to the sharp rise in the dollar exchange rate last year, which caused the Exchange Fund's non-dollar investments to incur foreign exchange valuation adjustments when converted into Hong Kong dollars. Meanwhile, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 700 million.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the Exchange Fund's total assets amounted to HK$3.6187 trillion. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments reached HK$181.8 billion, comprising HK$116.8 billion in private equity and HK$65 billion in real estate. A total of HK$133.8 billion had been committed but not yet drawn down for investment.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges in the investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded a 2% investment return in 2016 (excluding the strategic asset portfolio). The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of approximately 12% since 2009.\n\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years, including shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing positions in non-dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated diversification efforts, particularly in long-term growth portfolios. These measures have significantly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in accuracy, fluency, and terminology. Key issues include:  \n1. **Institutional Name:** The third translation incorrectly uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (HKMA).  \n2. **Terminology:** \"Maturity\" (third translation) is less precise than \"duration\" for bond portfolios. \"Non-dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets\" (first, second, fifth translations) is clearer than \"non-dollar and non-hkd assets\" (fourth, sixth translations).  \n3. **Fluency:** Phrases like \"accelerated the pace of diversifying\" (first, third, sixth translations) are wordy; \"accelerated diversification efforts\" is more concise.  \n4. **Redundancy:** Adding \"against shocks\" to \"resilience\" (fifth translation) is unnecessary, as \"resilience\" inherently implies shock resistance.  \n5. **Consistency:** The term \"Exchange Fund\" (first, second, fifth, sixth translations) is preferable to \"foreign exchange fund\" (third translation) for official contexts.  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, fluency, and formal tone while adhering to financial terminology and institutional correctness.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 displays the Exchange Fund’s investment return rates in 2016 and its average investment return rates for different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return rates were 0.9% over the past 3 years, 2.0% over the past 5 years, 2.6% over the past 10 years, and 4.8% since 1994. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund’s assets as of December 31, 2016.\n\nFigure 1: Rate of Return on Investment for the Foreign Exchange Fund (1994–2016)\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology and phrasing. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology**: \n   - \"策略性資產組合\" is best translated as \"strategic asset portfolio\" (used by Translators 1, 3, 4) rather than \"strategic asset allocation\" (used by 5, 6). The former aligns more closely with financial jargon.\n   - \"綜合消費物價指數\" requires \"Composite Consumer Price Index\" (used by 1, 3, 4) to reflect the \"綜合\" (composite) modifier, which is omitted in Translators 5 and 6.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar**:\n   - Translators 1, 3, and 4 use \"calculated using the series with 2014\/2015 as the base period,\" which is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. A smoother phrasing would be \"calculated using a series with 2014\/2015 as the base period.\"\n   - Translators 5 and 6 omit \"Composite\" in the CPI translation, which risks ambiguity in technical contexts.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness**:\n   - All translations are culturally neutral and appropriate for financial or economic documentation.\n**Improved Translation**:  \n1. The calculation of return on investment does not include assets within the strategic asset portfolio.  \n2. The Composite Consumer Price Index is calculated using a series with 2014\/2015 as the base period.\n\nTable 2: Exchange Fund Investment Returns (in Hong Kong Dollars)\n\n1. The first junior translator's translation is clear but uses \"calculated in\" instead of \"expressed in\" for the currency, which is slightly less precise. The term \"strategic asset allocation\" is accurate, but \"strategic asset portfolio\" in the second translation is less standard in financial contexts. The third translation's use of \"compound annual basis\" is better than \"compounded annual growth rate\" for the third point, as the original does not explicitly reference CAGR. The fifth translation's phrasing (\"varying periods\") is slightly more formal but still acceptable. The sixth translation's \"rate of return on investment\" is redundant compared to the original's \"investment return rate.\"\n2. The best translation should use \"investment return rate\" to match the original's precise terminology, \"strategic asset allocation\" as the standard term, and \"compound annual basis\" for the third point. The structure should maintain the original's list format with concise, active voice.\n**Improved Translation:**  \n1. The investment return rate for the years 2001 to 2003 is expressed in U.S. dollars. 2. The calculation of the investment return rate does not include assets within the strategic asset allocation. 3. Averages for different periods are calculated on a compound annual basis.\n\nTable 3: Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Fund Assets as of December 31, 2016 (including forward transactions)\n"}

Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen corporate governance, including advancing staff professional development, enforcing strict financial controls, and bolstering information technology security, to address challenges arising from implementing new measures and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n# Institutional Development through Maintaining Contact with the Public\n\n# Public Communication\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance its transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 81 public media activities, including 14 press conferences, 13 on-site interviews, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. During the year, 326 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large volume of media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nThis year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established two important offices: the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the FinTech Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain the roles and work plans of these two offices, the HKMA conducted various public communication initiatives. In addition, the HKMA held press briefings and seminars to deepen the public's understanding of its operations and measures in areas such as financial inclusion, reserve management, the FinTech Regulatory Sandbox, cybersecurity, and SME financing.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, met with journalists during the Hong Kong Bankers' Association's annual trip to Beijing in December 2016.\n\n# Public Inquiry\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service is an effective channel for the public to obtain information regarding the functions and operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This service handled 10,170 enquiries in 2016, representing a 12% increase compared to 2015. Approximately half of these enquiries concerned banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic matters, and consumer issues related to banking, particularly banking products and services, the coin collection scheme, guidelines and notices related to the banking sector, stored-value payment tools and retail payment systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities, and prudent regulatory measures for property mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public inquiries received each year since 2013, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of inquiries by category in 2016.\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the *Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability* and four issues of the *Quarterly Reports* during the year, while regularly updating the *Monthly Financial Data Bulletin* to provide the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary affairs, banking sector, and economic developments. Furthermore, the HKMA published 32 *Hui Si* (\"Insight\") articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 in 2015, elaborating on various specialized topics related to the HKMA's work.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's 2015 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the \"Non-profit and Charitable Organizations\" category at the Hong Kong Institute of Management's 2016 Best Annual Report Awards.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2. It introduces the HKMA's work to the public and enhances understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre comprises two sections: an exhibition hall and a library, both open to the public six days a week. The exhibition hall showcases the HKMA's functions and the development of Hong Kong's monetary and banking sectors, while also providing reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe Information Centre’s policy exhibition area, which explains the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and introduces related financial knowledge, underwent renovation in the fourth quarter of 2016 to enrich the exhibition content and incorporate a variety of interactive elements. These include edutainment-style games that make learning fun and help explain financial concepts in an accessible way, as well as visually engaging touch-screen displays that provide a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the HKMA’s work, all aimed at delivering a fresh visitor experience. Additionally, the renovated Information Centre now features a mosaic artwork depicting Victoria Harbour, created using over 130,000 Hong Kong coins. The newly revamped policy exhibition area reopened to the public on February 24, 2017.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the Authority's latest updates. The site hosts several statutory registers: the \"Register of Securities Business Staff of Recognized Institutions\" and the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance; and the \"Register of Licensees of Stored Value Payment Systems,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance. Dedicated thematic pages and prominent quick links highlight key initiatives, including the regulatory framework for stored value payment systems, IFFO and FFO, and important timely matters such as precautions against telephone fraud and the parking locations of coin collection program carts.\n\nThe new look of the Information Center's Policy Exhibition Area.\n\nA mosaic artwork assembled from Hong Kong coins depicting the scenery of Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe Information Center provides guided tours for visitors. This year, it welcomed over 56,200 visitors and conducted more than 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its December 2003 opening, the center has cumulatively welcomed over 586,600 visitors.  \nThe translations generally capture the core information but exhibit minor inconsistencies in verb choice, phrasing, and formality. Key observations:  \n1. **Verb Consistency**: \"Welcomed\" (used in translations 1, 3, 5) feels more personable than \"received\" (translations 2, 4, 6), aligning better with the context of a visitor service.  \n2. **Numerical Expression**: \"More than 580 times\" (translations 2, 4, 5) is more natural than \"580+ occasions\" (translation 3) or \"more than 580 times to schools...\" (translation 6, which also contains a mixed-language error: \"visitor人次\").  \n3. **Cumulative Total**: \"Cumulative total\" (translation 4) is slightly more precise than \"cumulatively welcomed\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 5), though both are acceptable.  \n4. **Tone and Flow**: \"This year alone\" (translation 3) adds emphasis but is unnecessary. \"Since its December 2003 opening\" (improved phrasing) is more concise than \"since its opening in December 2003.\"  \nThe final translation balances clarity, formality, and natural phrasing while avoiding redundancy and errors.\n\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition hall houses over 23,000 books, journals, and other publications for in-depth research on topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking. It also maintains electronic records of authorized institutions and their local representative offices, as well as employees engaged in securities business, as stipulated under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo stay connected with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) work, the HKMA continues to host public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA held three public seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers. The topics covered included the linked exchange rate system, banking system stability, Hong Kong banknotes, smart tips for using banking products and services, and the Deposit Protection Scheme. Since their introduction in 1998, these educational seminars have been attended by over 56,400 members of the public.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools across various districts attended one of the public education lectures.\n\nFigure 3: Types of Groups Visiting the Information Center in 2016\n\n# Human Resources\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employs, trains, and maintains a professional and competent workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work priorities. As part of the government structure, the HKMA hires staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA is committed to maintaining a streamlined and flexible organizational structure, and wherever possible, implements new measures and manages increasing workloads by optimally utilizing existing staff.\n\n# Staffing Levels\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had a staffing complement of 875 at the beginning of 2016. In the second half of 2016, 12 positions were added to fulfill the HKMA’s regulatory functions under the new insurance regulatory regime. Consequently, the HKMA’s staffing complement stood at 887 by the end of 2016.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new legislation and policies, continuing ongoing pilot programs, and managing the increasingly complex and demanding workload, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s total staff strength increased by 40 to 927 staff members in 2017, representing a 4.5% increase. The newly created positions are responsible for the following functions:  \n- Promoting the stability of the banking and financial system, including:  \n    - Enhancing supervisory capacity to manage the growing technological risks in banks and new fintech initiatives, as well as addressing banks’ expansion within the region and their business operations;  \n    - Strengthening regulatory and law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and preparing for the Mutual Evaluation Program under the 2018 Anti-Money Laundering Financial Action Task Force Special Action Plan;  \n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the *Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance* to address the “too big to fail” issue in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and  \n    - Enhancing supervisory capacity to align with new international standards on capital and market risks, and allocating additional resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.  \n- Strengthening investment, risk management, and related support functions in response to the increased investment work involved in further promoting the diversification of Exchange Fund investment products, while reinforcing strategic asset allocation and investment procedures to cope with the increasingly challenging investment environment.  \n- Developing and implementing talent development programs, and enhancing related resources, to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to meet market developments and future challenges.  \n- Strengthening research on monetary policy and the processing of monetary statistics, as well as allocating resources to handle inquiries and complaints related to the licensing\/designation and related regulatory matters concerning stored-value payment instruments and retail payment systems.\n\nTable 1 lists the position establishment and actual number of staff at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) by department.  \nTable 1: Position Establishment and Actual Staff Numbers of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as of January 1, 2017.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates temporary resources to address other tasks and second staff to international or local institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Development Bureau, to assist with work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved. In addition, the HKMA second staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Hong Kong Association of Banks to provide full-time or supportive operational assistance.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the salaries and service conditions for Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff by consulting the governing committees under his jurisdiction through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and by referencing market compensation levels and practices. The compensation package includes cash compensation and mandatory provident fund contributions, along with a range of basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a fixed monthly salary (basic salary) and a variable pay component awarded annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain recommendations from the HKMA’s Governance Committee. This review considers the Governance Committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a remuneration survey conducted by an independent human resources consultancy in the financial sector, and other relevant factors. Individual employees with outstanding performance may also receive special adjustments to maintain their competitive compensation.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates approved funds for adjusting annual fixed salaries or distributing variable pay to individual employees based on their performance. The variable pay system for professional investment staff is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to fixed salaries or distribution of variable pay for employees at the Assistant General Manager level or above are approved by the Financial Secretary after considering the views of the Governance Committee, and these employees will recuse themselves from discussions on proposals concerning their own remuneration at meetings. Adjustments to fixed salaries or distribution of variable pay for employees at the Manager level and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, under the authorization of the Financial Secretary, and in accordance with the total amount approved for salary payments.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 presents the compensation data for senior management in 2016.\n\n1.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","en":"# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Commission\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") set out on pages 149 to 237, which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2016, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Accountants and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of an Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Office. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were most significant in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I addressed these matters when auditing the overall financial statements and forming my opinion, and I will not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Auditor General's Report (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow should I handle relevant matters during an audit?\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology and formatting. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology**: \"Valuation\" (估值) is appropriate for accounting contexts, though \"measurement\" (測量) is also acceptable in IFRS standards. However, \"valuation\" is more commonly used in financial reporting.\n2. **Prepositional Phrases**: \"Measured at fair value\" (按公平值列帳) is the precise accounting term, though \"at fair value\" alone is also acceptable. The participle phrase \"measured at fair value\" is grammatically correct but could be rephrased for clarity.\n3. **Capitalization**: While title case (e.g., \"Valuation of Financial Assets...\") is acceptable for headings, it is unnecessary in general prose. The use of # in translations 3 and 6 mirrors the original's formatting but is non-standard in English professional writing.\n4. **Redundancy**: Omitting \"financial\" before \"liabilities\" (as in translation 5) risks ambiguity, though context may justify it. Including it ensures precision.\n**Improvements**: The best translation balances precision, clarity, and standard English conventions. Using \"Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\" retains the original's specificity while adhering to accounting terminology and avoiding unnecessary formatting.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled HKD 3,198.975 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 963.977 billion.\n\nThe fair value of 95% of such financial assets and all such financial liabilities is based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 parameters), or is estimated using valuation techniques with parameters derived from observable market data (Level 2 parameters).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of such financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The related financial assets amount to HKD 1,758.86 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:  \n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring controls;  \n- Evaluating and testing monitoring controls, including application controls within computer systems;  \n- Obtaining audit evidence regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;  \n- Verifying prices against independent sources when market quotations are used;  \n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of related assumptions, and verifying parameters against independent sources, if the valuation method’s parameters are based on observable market data; and  \n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of related assumptions and parameters, if the valuation method’s parameters are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Future Fund Deposit\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28 to the financial statements.\n\nIn previous years, the vast majority of deposits in the fiscal reserves were required to be repaid upon demand and bore interest calculated at a fixed rate determined annually based on the past investment returns of the reference investment portfolio.\n\nThe government established the Future Fund within its fiscal reserves on January 1, 2016. The Future Fund’s deposits comprise an initial capital injection of HK$219.73 billion from the Land Fund surplus, as well as regular contributions transferred from the government’s general revenue account (the amount to be determined by the Financial Secretary). Interest on the Future Fund’s deposits is calculated based on a composite rate, which references a fixed rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and an annual return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and real estate investments), determined on a weighted average basis each year. Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the deposits of the Future Fund, together with any accrued interest, are to be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Future Fund held deposits totaling HKD 224.53 billion. The accumulated interest earned on these deposits amounted to HKD 10.071 billion. Due to the large amounts involved and significant changes in deposit terms, particular attention is required in the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of information regarding these deposits and the interest earned thereon.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translations generally capture the core meaning but contain critical errors in numerical formatting and minor inconsistencies in phrasing. The third translation incorrectly states \"2,245.30 billion HKD\" instead of the correct \"224.53 billion HKD\" (1億 = 100 million, so 2,245.30億 = 224.53 billion). The fourth translation misrepresents the interest amount as \"10.07 billion\" instead of \"10.071 billion.\" These numerical errors undermine credibility.  \nFluency and formality are consistent across translations, but \"HKD\" is preferable to \"Hong Kong dollars\" for conciseness in financial contexts. The phrase \"particular attention is required\" (used in translations 2, 5, 6) is more formal and precise than \"careful attention is required\" (translation 4) or \"special attention is required\" (translation 3). The term \"disclosure of information regarding these deposits\" (translation 6) is more precise than \"disclosure information for the deposits\" (translation 3).  \nThe improved translation corrects numerical errors, adopts \"HKD,\" and refines phrasing for precision and formality while maintaining clarity and adherence to financial terminology.\n\nThe audit procedures for future fund deposits include:  \n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used to measure the deposits and the interest earned thereon;  \n- Examining the methodology for calculating the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio;  \n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed interest rate determined based on the historical performance of the reference portfolio, the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio, and the composite interest rate derived from these two rates;  \n- Verifying the accrued interest amount calculated using the composite interest rate; and  \n- Reviewing the presentation and disclosures of the deposits and interest earned thereon in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value\nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and adherence to accounting terminology. Key observations:\n1. \"Measured at fair value\" is less precise than \"carried at fair value\" in accounting contexts, as \"carried\" refers to the presentation on financial statements.\n2. Capitalization of \"Investment Property\" as a title is appropriate, though some translations use lowercase inconsistently.\n3. The use of \"Properties\" (plural) is unnecessary unless the original explicitly refers to multiple assets, which it does not.\n4. The hashtag (#) in the second translation matches the original's formatting, which should be preserved for consistency.\n5. \"Carried at fair value\" is the standard IFRS terminology for assets valued at market price on balance sheets.\nThe optimal translation balances technical accuracy with formal presentation, using the precise accounting term \"carried at fair value\" and maintaining the original's structural elements.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 17, and 18 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 22.723 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in three associate companies and 14 joint ventures, which primarily engage in holding overseas investment properties, with the total value of these interests amounting to HKD 32.083 billion. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or through associate companies or joint ventures, is primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:  \n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by associates and joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is based on the valuations stated in the relevant reports;  \n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the related assumptions and parameters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for other information. This other information includes all information contained in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2016 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I do not express any form of attestation conclusion on other information.\n\nWith regard to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with circumstances known to me during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The officer must also implement internal controls that they consider necessary to ensure the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial management officer must assess the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclose matters related to the going concern where applicable, and use the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Responsibilities of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Material misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and they are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:  \n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements arising from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;  \n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether their accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable;  \n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw users’ attention to the related disclosures in the auditor’s report. If those disclosures are inadequate, I must issue a non-unqualified audit report. My conclusion is based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or circumstances may result in the Group being unable to continue as a going concern;  \n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and  \n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Council regarding the audit scope and timeline, as well as significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls identified during the audit period.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but exhibit inconsistencies in terminology and accuracy. Key issues include:  \n1. **Committee Name:** Translations 2-4, 6 incorrectly omit \"Foreign\" in \"Foreign Exchange Fund,\" misrepresenting the official title. The original explicitly states \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" (Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Council).  \n2. **Audit Period vs. Audit:** Translations 1, 5, 6 use \"audit period\" (審計期間), while others use \"audit\" alone. The original specifies \"審計期間,\" so \"during the audit period\" is more precise.  \n3. **Material vs. Significant:** \"Material weaknesses\" (重大缺陷) is the standard audit term, preferred over \"significant deficiencies\" (重大缺陷) in professional contexts.  \n4. **Redundant Additions:** Translation 3 introduces \"planned audit\" (planned audit), which is not in the original. Translation 4 erroneously adds \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" an entity not referenced in the source text.  \n5. **Fluency:** Translations 1 and 5 use \"timeline\" (時間), while others use \"timing\" (時間). \"Timeline\" is more natural in this context.  \nThe best translation integrates accurate terminology, maintains the original structure, and avoids unnecessary additions. It uses \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Council,\" \"audit period,\" and \"material weaknesses\" to align with professional audit standards and the source text.\n"}
