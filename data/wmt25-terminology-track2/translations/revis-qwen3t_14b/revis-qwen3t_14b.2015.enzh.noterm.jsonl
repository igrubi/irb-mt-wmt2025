{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","zh":"# 2015年亮點\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現疲軟。本地股市在全球金融市場波動加劇的背景下出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始降溫。\n\n香港銀行業依然具備韌性。本地註冊的持牌機構（AIs）資本充足，其流動性狀況持續穩健。零售銀行的資產質量略有下降，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n港元兌美元匯率大致穩定，強方兌換承擔機制於四月、九月及十月多次被觸發。儘管全球金融市場動盪，港元匯率市場仍有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度對外來衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。在美國聯邦儲備局決定上調聯邦基金利率目標區間後，香港基本利率於十二月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n針對人工智慧風險治理的監督工作已加強，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布在香港實施逆週期資本緩衝，並指定五間獲授權機構為本地系統重要性銀行。有關在香港建立金融機構解決機制，以及透過加快賠付以強化存款保障計劃的立法建議，已分別提交立法會。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及區域論壇，同時不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。為改善稅務環境以推動香港成為企業財務中心樞紐，相關立法建議已於12月提交至立法會。\n\n香港仍是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，擁有相當深度與廣度的市場。內地與香港基金互認安排於七月實施，進一步擴大香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施因電子支票服務於十二月成功推出而進一步增強，讓客戶能夠在網上簽發及存入支票。一套新的監管制度將於十一月開始實施，該制度規定多用途儲值設施的發牌事宜，並指定重要的零售支付系統。\n\n# 儲備管理  \n在嚴峻的投資環境下，外匯基金錄得整體投資回報率為-0.6%。截至2015年底，基金總資產達到3,422.9億港元。\n\n金管局加快投資多元化進程，特別是透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）進行的投資。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計達1,421億港元，其中包括913億港元的私募股權投資及508億港元的房地產投資，未償投資承諾金額達1,224億港元。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會各界及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。為進一步提升企業管治水平，管理局支持員工專業發展，建立嚴謹的財務紀律，加強資訊安全，並重新分配高層管理人員的職責，以應對新措施實施及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長將在嚴峻的外部環境及脆弱的金融市場條件下維持溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港本年度經濟增長有所放緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長由2014年的2.6%降至2.4%（表1）。這反映出本地需求擴張趨於溫和，儘管淨出口重新成為GDP增長的正面因素，因總進口量下降速度超過總出口量（圖1）。儘管經濟表現相對平平，勞動市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低水平。通脹進一步緩和，因本地成本及進口價格壓力持續減輕。本地股市在國際金融市場波動加劇的背景下出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月第七輪審慎措施公布後開始轉趨平穩，至年底樓價進一步顯示出盤整跡象。\n\n圖表1 按貢獻分類的實際國內生產總值增長  \n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n表1 按支出項目分類的實質GDP成長率（環比）\n\n注意：經季節調整的國內固定資本形成總額季度對季度變動率目前不可用。  \n來源：統計及普查局。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年香港維持匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率持續徘徊於7.75水平。由於與股權相關的資金流入，4月觸發了聯繫匯率制度下的強方兌換承諾，9月及10月則因離岸人民幣兌換港元及部分商業對港元的需求再度啟動。隨著總結餘擴大，本地利率持續保持低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率在12月中旬美國加息後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求放緩，銀行業總貸款增長進一步減緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降。銀行業整體貸款質素略有惡化，但分類貸款比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年國內需求增速放緩。儘管整體就業與收入狀況持續提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱與資產價格調整拖累下半年私人消費增長。然而，由於上半年較強的增長動能，全年私人消費增速從2014年的3.3%提升至4.8%。政府消費則以3.4%的增速小幅加快。事實上，國內需求增速放緩主要歸因於固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（見圖2）。私人部門機械設備購置連續第二年下滑，企業信心惡化，建築與工程活動亦因公共建設進展較慢而呈現較弱的增長動能。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港2015年的出口表現惡化（圖3）。貨物出口出現全面下滑，跌幅達1.7%，為自2009年以來首次出現下跌。對日本及歐盟的出口下降，而對美國的出口則增長有限。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求亦拖累區域工業活動及區內貿易。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、韓國及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體中間需求及最終需求疲弱而下降。香港的服務出口持續從早年高增長軌道放緩，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊放緩。貨物進口亦隨本地及出口引致的需求減弱而回落。相比之下，服務進口增長則因本地居民強勁的旅遊需求而加快。整體而言，2015年淨出口有所改善，對GDP增長作出輕微正面貢獻。\n\n圖表 2 內需  \n資料來源：統計及人口普查處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2015年，核心通脹進一步緩和，主因在於本地成本壓力減退及進口物價通脹下降。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，核心通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（見圖4）。在經濟活動低迷的背景下，勞動成本壓力維持穩定，而商業及工業租賃成本壓力則有所緩和，尤其在下半年更為明顯。受益於全球商品價格回落及港元強勢，進口物價壓力減輕，食品通脹亦維持低水平。由於較早季度新落成住宅租金的傳導效應較為溫和，通脹中的租賃成分仍受控。\n\n圖表3 商品及服務出口  \n資料來源：人口普查及統計處。\n\n圖4 核心消費者物價膨脹  \n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年勞動市場狀況保持穩定。雖然與貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業人數略有下降，但其他商業部門的聘用步伐穩健，有效抵銷了該降幅，使總就業人數較去年增長1.3%。由於勞動力供應亦增加1.3%，全年經季節調整後的失業率維持在約3.3%（圖5）。鑑於勞動市場仍然緊張，年初三季名義勞工收入增長4.7%，較2014年同期的4.3%為高。隨著通脹壓力減輕，年初三季實質勞工收入增長1.3%，而2014年同期則錄得下降0.1%。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市因外部環境急劇變化而經歷波動的一年。首季表現持平，但隨着內地A股市場看漲情緒興起及資金流入，本地股市在第二季表現積極。4月恆生指數急升至七年來最高水平，滬港通南向每日配額自2014年11月啟動以來首次用盡（圖6）。然而，自6月下旬起，本地市場轉向下跌，受內地A股市場及全球股市拋售潮、全球外匯市場波動加劇及國際商品價格走弱等因素影響，恆生指數在9月跌至年度低點，跌幅達28%。隨著全球及內地金融市場逐步穩定，本地股市在第四季有所回升。2015年全年，恆生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而平均每日成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。雖然下半年集資活動有所減緩，但來自本地股市的股本集資總額仍由去年同期的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現盤整跡象。在2015年初經歷一段活躍期後，住宅物業市場於2月第七輪審慎措施公布後趨於軟化。儘管房價在第四季下跌前上漲速度放緩，但2015年全年房價累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期減少12.3%，降至55,982單位，因二手市場交易活動在下半年明顯下滑。投機性交易，包括確認書交易及短線炒房交易，持續保持在低水平。儘管如此，家庭購屋負擔仍持續沉重，價格收入比達15.7，收入負擔比遠高於長期平均水平。商用及工業地產市場上半年表現活躍，但交易活動隨後趨緩，價格與租金在第四季均出現下跌。租金報酬率大致與去年同期持平，並維持在歷史低點附近。\n\n圖表6 資產價格  \n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2016年的經濟增長預期將維持疲軟。私人機構分析師預測經濟將以較慢的平均增長率1.7%擴張，而政府則預測增長幅度將介乎1%至2%之間。具體而言，疲弱的全球增長前景、持續低迷的入境旅遊，以及全球金融市場動盪所引發的負面溢出效應，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。本地方面，私人消費預期將溫和增長，因經濟動能較弱，勞動市場或將面臨一定壓力，而本地資產價格調整或會削弱消費者信心，並引發負面財富效應。建築及建設活動或可維持穩定，但企業信心偏弱及利率上調將對私人資本投資構成壓力。\n\n#通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n2016年通貨膨脹壓力預期將維持在可控範圍內。進口價格壓力料將保持溫和，而國內成本壓力在經濟增長動能適中之際亦預計相對溫和。由於2015年底新租賃住宅租金壓力減緩，通脹中的租金成分也可能趨緩。市場共識預測2016年整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府則預計核心通脹率為2.0%。受入境旅遊減緩及出口部門持續低迷影響，勞動市場也可能略微放緩。民間機構分析師目前預計2016年失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n二零一六年的經濟前景面臨多項不確定性與風險。特別是美國利率進一步上調的節奏、全球增長前景以及大宗商品價格波動，將持續成為主要不確定因素。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動，進而收緊本地貨幣與金融條件，並為香港的增長前景蒙上陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將取決於其透過財富效應及資產負債表效應對樓市的衝擊程度。儘管樓市正面臨全球及本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及供需差距收窄等下行風險，但目前仍需更多時間觀察是否已進入下行週期。雖然樓市的急劇調整可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但近年來實施的逆週期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已顯著提升香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業在本年度仍表現出韌性，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體的潛在風險不斷積累。認可機構（AIs）的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的認可機構資本充裕。零售銀行的資產質素略有惡化，但整體仍處於健康水平。\n\n#利率趨勢\n\n與美元利率同步，港元銀行同業拆息全年維持在低水平。零售銀行的港元融資成本上半年因複合利率呈下降趨勢而下降，下半年則保持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖表7 香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）定盤價、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）  \n說明：  \n1.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n港元匯率在二零一五年全年大致保持穩定，儘管金融市場動盪，且美國於十二月啟動加息。貨幣市場亦持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。作為香港過去數十年貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度持續展現高度抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。所謂貨幣穩定，是指港元在外汇市場上對美元的匯率維持在 HK$7.75 至 HK$7.85 兌 1 美元的波動範圍內。香港的貨幣體系結構以聯繫匯率制度為特徵，該制度要求貨幣基礎至少有 100% 由外匯基金持有的美元儲備資產支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須由美元儲備資產的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表1）包括\n\n債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保  \n政府發行並流通行中的紙幣及硬幣  \n總結餘，即銀行在香港金融管理局開設的清算賬戶餘額總和  \n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的發行基金票據及債券\n\n港元匯率的穩定性透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）來維持。當港元需求大於供應，市場匯率強升至強方兌換承諾水平（每美元7.75港元）時，HKMA會隨時準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此舉將使總體餘額擴張，壓低港元利率，創造貨幣條件，使港元匯率從強方限制水平回調至7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。反之，若港元供應大於需求，市場匯率弱降至弱方兌換承諾水平（每美元7.85港元）時，HKMA將向銀行購入港元。此舉將使總體餘額收縮，推高港元利率，使港元匯率從弱方限制水平回調，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區間內。\n\n本處所列的債務證書及流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣，均以港幣面值表示。本年度報告中匯兌基金資產負債表所顯示的對應項目，則以港幣計值，其金額等同於根據資產負債表日適用匯率換算後，贖回該等證券所需之美元金額。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計準則。\n\n於本報告中顯示的EFBN金額，與本年度報告中外匯基金的資產負債表所載金額有所不同。根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表外匯基金在二級市場交易的EFBN，將與已發行的EFBN相互抵銷，淨額記入資產負債表。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2015年，港元兌美元匯率大致維持穩定，交易範圍維持在7.7500至7.7657之間窄幅波動（見圖1）。2015年初，市場對美國加息的擔憂令港元承受輕微貶值壓力。然而，第二季港元匯率回升至接近7.75水平，主要由於股市活動活躍，促使與股權相關的港元需求急升，導致4月強方維護機制（CU）多次觸發。進入年中後，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著拋售，以及全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動性增加，港元兌美元匯率在8月仍維持於接近7.75水平。9月及10月，由於離岸人民幣兌港元的轉換增加，強方維護機制（CU）再度被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25個基點，但港元兌美元匯率仍維持在狹窄範圍內波動，未出現顯著資金外流壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場環境動盪，2015年港元匯率市場運作有序。\n\n圖表1：2015年市場匯率\n\n由於強方貨幣單位（CU）在四月、九月及十月屢次被觸發，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據貨幣發行局原則，被動地從銀行購入總額293億美元，換取2,272億港元。這導致總結餘相應擴張，其中部分擴張被銀行對流動性管理的強烈需求所引發的額外發行發鈔基金紙幣所抵銷（見圖2）。發鈔基金紙幣的額外發行符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這代表貨幣基礎組成的改變，而貨幣基礎則完全由外匯儲備支持。總結餘與未償還發鈔基金紙幣及債券的總額，由2014年底的9925億港元增至2015年底的12,210億港元。\n\n圖表2：2015年總餘額及未償還之外匯基金紙幣\n\n#貨幣市場\n\n在銀行體系流動性充足的情況下，2015年全年港元銀行間利率持續處於低位。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）由0至0.25%上調至0.25至0.5%後，根據預設公式，香港基本利率亦於12月17日由0.5%上調至0.75%。整體而言，2015年港元銀行間利率（期限由隔夜至三個月）均低於基本利率（見圖3），並因銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場波動導致流動性收緊而出現溫和波動。廣泛反映香港銀行間拆息率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行間拆息率（LIBOR）的利差，港元遠期點數於8月因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著升水，但隨後因美元利率普遍上調，至年底則轉為貼水（見圖4）。總體而言，貨幣市場運作正常，貼現窗口貸款活動不活躍，2015年總額僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖3 2015年港幣銀行間利率\n\n圖4：2015年港幣遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻。鑒於香港經濟規模細小且開放，以及其作為國際金融中心的地位，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定不移地致力維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，公眾對港元作為支付手段及價值儲值工具的信心持續強勁。在2015年與香港進行的第四條磋商（Article IV consultation）中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續認可聯繫匯率制度為香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管力度，以提升銀行業的韌性。鑒於美國利率上調，HKMA提醒公眾應做好風險管理的必要準備，指出任何觸發弱方兌換保證及港元流出，都是港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高外匯基金賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從外匯基金資產中劃出特定部分用以支持貨幣基礎。2015年間，支撐比率（定義為支撐資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3%至107.5%的窄幅範圍內，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平，截至12月31日，該比率為106.3%（見圖表5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為支撐組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財務資源為應對突發衝擊，提供了強大的後盾，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n圖表5 2015年擔保比率每日波動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港金融管理局結匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣基金委員會小組委員會負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，該小組委員會審議的議題包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應、國際間宏觀審慎措施的應用、美國加息對香港樓市的影響、基準利率的計算公式、港元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。小組委員會的討論記錄及提交予該委員會的貨幣基金委員會運作報告，均已上載至香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港貨幣研究所（HKIMR）持續資助貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域的研究。2015年，該機構接待了16位研究員，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構主辦了五場國際會議和研討會。主要包括：\n\n* 一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟會議，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。會議發表了11篇高質量研究論文，涵蓋中國企業槓桿、信貸泡沫與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等廣泛議題。  \n* 五月由香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦的「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、制度與經濟增長研討會」，探討多項經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。  \n* 十月由香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦儲備理事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦的「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」研討會，探討貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率的關係、貨幣政策分歧對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策的外溢效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等廣泛議題。\n\n本院亦於八月舉辦第十三屆香港金融管理局研究局夏季研討會，並於九月舉辦第十三屆香港金融管理局研究局內地經濟研討會，探討中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。上述研討會及研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的參與者。此外，本院本年度共舉辦二十四場公開研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融等廣泛議題。\n\n# 紙幣和硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通紙幣總值為3602億港元，較去年同期增加5.3%（圖表6、7及8）。政府發行的紙幣及硬幣總值為112億港元，上升2.9%（圖表9及10）。其中，政府發行的10港元紙幣流通總值為40億港元，85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在獲授權機構的風險治理上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為。隨著系統性風險的積聚，金管局於2016年1月1日宣布在香港實施0.625%的逆週期資本緩衝（並於2017年1月1日提高至1.25%）。五間獲授權機構被指定為本地系統重要性銀行，將適用較高的損失吸收能力資本緩衝。在《金融機構（解決）條例草案》提交立法會後，有關恢復與解決機制的改革取得重大進展。金管局亦加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融專業人員的技能與知識水平。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的跡象下，新興市場於2015年面臨資本外流風險上升及經濟增長放緩的挑戰。為維持銀行體系在宏觀經濟環境可能突然惡化情況下的韌性，香港金融管理局持續密切監察認可機構（AIs）的風險治理有效性及其信貸與流動性風險管理系統。\n\n# 營運監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採用監管方法，即在進行定期現場檢查的同時，增加主題性審查的次數。主題性審查為針對選定持牌機構群組的特定風險領域或特定活動而進行的深入非現場審查。這種方法使香港金融管理局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於持牌機構所面臨的新興及更重大的風險。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於本年度共進行了193次現場檢查。鑒於授權機構貸款組合的資產質素出現惡化跡象，HKMA加強了針對信貸風險管理及資產質素的深入主題性現場檢查。同時，因應主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分歧所引致的市場不確定性，HKMA亦增加了對庫務相關活動的檢查次數。此外，HKMA還對與內地業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，以及授權機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型進行了現場檢查。本年度內，專門團隊亦對授權機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查類似的範疇。表1列載運作監督工作的詳細資料。\n\n2015年，針對金融機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作，共進行了196次非現場審查。監管重點包括風險治理、資本規劃、企業信貸及巴塞爾協議III標準的落實監督。監管團隊與所選金融機構的董事會及外部審計師保持頻繁聯繫。與金融機構高階管理階層及外部審計師舉行了20場三方會議，並與所選金融機構的董事會或董事會層級委員會舉行了23場會議。\n\n銀行監管審查委員會審議了四個案例，所有案例均涉及人工智能的授權事宜。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以應對競爭性優先事項，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求認可金融機構委任外部審計師跟進可能對監管構成重大影響的問題。2015年，香港金融管理局根據該條款委託進行六份報告，其中兩份報告涉及反洗錢／反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，另外兩份報告涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，認可機構均未違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動性比率的規定。根據條例各項條文，合共出現84宗違規情況，但均未影響存款人權益，且已由認可機構及時糾正。\n\n表1 運作監督\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條賦予的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n**Review of Translations:**\n1. **Bank Name Accuracy:** Multiple translations incorrectly rendered \"Melli Bank Plc\" as \"Mellifont\" (1,4), \"Mellie\" (2,3,5), or \"Citibank\" (6). The correct transliteration should be \"Melli Bank有限公司\" to preserve the original name.\n2. **\"AI’s depositors\" Misinterpretation:** Translation 6 erroneously translated \"AI’s\" as \"人工智能\" (artificial intelligence), while the original likely refers to the bank's depositors (e.g., \"存款人\" or \"該銀行存款人\").\n3. **Terminology Consistency:** \"Monetary Authority\" should consistently be \"貨幣當局\" or \"香港金融管理局\" (HKMA), not \"貨幣按察局\" (6). \"Supervisory measures\" in translation 3 (\"監管措施\") is appropriate, but \"monitor developments\" should use \"監察\" (monitor) rather than \"監控\" (control).\n4. **Fluency and Grammar:** Translation 1 and 4 are fluent but use \"仍受...管轄\" (still subject to jurisdiction), which is slightly awkward. Translation 2's \"繼續受到...執行\" (continue to be subject to execution) misuses \"執行\" (execute). Translation 5's \"行使的約束\" (constraints of exercising) is grammatically unclear.\n**Improved Translation:**\nMelli Bank有限公司持續受《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力管轄。香港金融管理局於2008年6月25日根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條，對Melli Bank有限公司香港分行的事務、業務及財產所作出的指示，在本年度內持續有效。香港金融管理局將繼續與有關當局保持定期溝通，以監察該分行及其英國總行的發展情況，並密切留意所採取的監管措施，以保障該銀行存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評級審查\n\nCAMEL核准委員會審查並確定金融機構的綜合CAMEL評分。金融機構已被告知評分結果，並有機會要求複核。當年度無任何機構提出複核申請。\n\n# 專業監督工作\n\n# 營運與科技風險監控\n\n香港金融管理局持續根據新興風險及行業發展，發佈有關營運及科技風險管理的新指引或更新指引。特別是，香港金融管理局已完成《監管政策手冊》（SPM）中與電子銀行（e-banking）相關模組的修訂，使認可機構在提供新電子銀行服務方面擁有更大靈活性。此外，香港金融管理局亦發佈有關網絡安全的通函，重申認可機構董事會及高層管理人員需對有效的網絡安全風險管理進行監督的重要性。香港金融管理局亦定期發佈「營運事故觀察」，重點介紹所選詐騙案件或營運事故的作案手法，以及所識別的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局進行以風險為本的主題性現場及非現場監管審查，以評估獲授權機構（AIs）在企業層面或特定業務範疇內的營運及科技風險管理情況。這些審查涵蓋與AIs營運風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防止異常交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢的科技控制等特定範疇。這些監管審查亦配合年度獨立合規檢查，涵蓋營運風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性計劃，其中選定的AIs須聘請獨立且具資格的評估人員，檢視其相關控制措施的充分性，並修復所發現的弱點。香港金融管理局亦識別並分析AIs營運及科技風險的趨勢及監管重點，特別針對在維持香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的持牌機構。\n\n香港金融管理局監督銀行業於2015年底完成基於晶片的自動櫃員機技術最後階段的實施，該技術使持牌機構完成純信用卡的換卡程序。香港金融管理局亦要求發卡機構實施認證控制措施，以進一步提升「無卡交易」信用卡交易的安全性。此外，接獲報告指部分非接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可能被暗中存取後，香港金融管理局要求相關持牌機構迅速採取行動，通知並保護受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局亦投入資源向公眾宣傳及解釋事件的規模與影響，以緩解公眾疑慮，並監督持牌機構的補救措施，包括及時更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦提升公眾對網上銀行安全預防措施認識的宣傳活動、建立分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為香港金融服務業務連續性管理論壇主辦的危機管理演習提供支援及建議，該演習參與機構包括人工智能及其他金融機構。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就人工智能（AI）銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強制性公積金計劃提供指引及監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構理事會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議涵蓋不同金融服務領域內具有密切業務關係的金融集團或受規管實體所涉及的各項議題，以確保監管行動更具協調性與有效性。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了25項現場及非現場主題檢查，以及15項非現場監察，針對持牌機構（AIs）。這些檢查涵蓋投資產品的銷售、證券交易結算的處理及客戶證券的安全保管，以及涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品及強積金（MPF）相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月，香港金融管理局向授權機構發出通函，就向客戶銷售非保證投資連結保險（NLTI）產品時的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助授權機構遵守監管標準，包括保險事務專員公署及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局持續與財政及庫務局（FSTB）緊密合作，參與《2014年保險公司（修訂）條例草案》的立法程序，以建立獨立的保險業監管局，並為保險中介人設立法定牌照制度。2015年7月，立法會通過《2015年保險公司（修訂）條例》，其中規定透過授權，賦予金管局對保險中介人的保險中介活動進行視察及調查的權力。\n\n香港金融管理局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗由註冊機構提出的從事額外受規管活動的申請。該局批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券活動的行政人員，並對由註冊機構提交、用以納入香港金融管理局維護登記冊的9,697名人士進行背景調查。\n\n# 國庫活動的監督\n審視各譯本後，發現主要差異在於「國庫」與「財務」、「庫務」的語義精準度，以及「活動」是否完整保留。第一、三譯本使用「國庫活動監督」最貼近原文語意，但未使用「的」字連結語義關係。第二譯本「庫務活動監督」雖具體，但「庫務」偏重行政職能，與「treasury」的財政管理意涵稍有出入。第四、五譯本以「財務」取代「國庫」，語義過於籠統。第六譯本「庫務監督」省略「活動」，資訊不完整。最佳改進方向為保留「國庫」的精準性，並以「的」字強化語義關係，使「國庫活動的監督」既符合中文語法，又完整傳達原文意涵。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續將持牌機構（AIs）的流動性風險管理列為其監管重點之一，特別是在美國利率正常化預期及隨後可能出現的資金流動逆轉，對AIs流動性狀況可能產生影響的情況下。2015年全年，HKMA繼續實施針對AIs的強化穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金來支持貸款業務。自2015年1月1日開始實施巴塞爾協議III的流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）以來，HKMA一直監測第一類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構一般維持LCR接近或超過100%，遠高於根據過渡安排於2015年所設定的法定最低要求60%。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）針對選定的授權機構（AIs）管理預期利率正常化相關風險的控制框架，進行主題性現場檢查。在市場波動期間，HKMA亦密切關注市場急劇變化及其對銀行業及個別授權機構的影響，並採取適當後續行動。\n\n# 主管主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行由監管機構主導的自下而上壓力測試計劃，以更深入掌握本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟環境下的韌性，並鼓勵其制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的方案。為更精準掌握所選領域的風險動態，本年度已引入多項改進措施，以收集更細緻的資料。金管局分析了認可機構提交的測試結果，並與其探討如何進一步優化壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n近年來觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已明顯減緩。就全年而言，銀行部門總貸款額增加3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降（見表2）。由於客戶存款增速快於銀行貸款，2015年底整體貸款佔存款比率降至70.1%，較去年同期的72.2%有所下降。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，呼籲加強國際合作與溝通以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化機遇，進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港穩健的經濟基本面及良好的財政表現持續獲得信用評級機構認可，標準普爾亦維持香港的最高評級AAA。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際有關全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題討論。今年七月，該局接任亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）共同主席一職，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定理事會成員與非成員之間在政策倡議上的交流，鼓勵落實金融改革，並促進有關金融穩定議題的觀點交流。香港金融管理局持續與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局密切合作，強化東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）——該機構已升格為國際組織——的運作，以監測與分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n今年，香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行因多項市場因素而出現一定程度的收縮。然而，市場運作仍維持有序，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易量持續穩定增長。此外，透過香港進行及在香港展開的人民幣業務不斷擴張，有助國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）將人民幣認定為自由使用的貨幣。IMF決定將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將進一步推動人民幣國際化，以及促進香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢方面發揮重要作用。2015年，香港人民幣支付系統的交易額創下新高，同時，場外衍生工具（OTC）交易報告庫亦持續支持機構按照於七月推出的場外衍生工具市場監管制度要求，報告其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年進一步強化香港的金融基礎設施，新增多項組件及服務，其中包括於同年12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著目前已有超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及流動通訊渠道接收及處理客戶的電子支票。自2013年推出電子帳單呈遞及支付（EBPP）服務以來，2015年商戶參與度持續增長。同年7月，中央銀錢市場單位（CMu）在其基金訂單路由服務下推出新服務，以支持內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）的實施。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦因《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）於11月生效而得到改善。根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》，香港金融管理局獲賦權推行多用途儲值設施的強制許可制度，並執行相關監管及執法職能，同時指定重要零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫日益緊密，香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極透過國際及區域論壇，包括金融穩定委員會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），與其他司法管轄區合作，推動可持續經濟增長及金融體系穩定。HKMA亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以協助強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）RCG(A)的共同主席，並於十月在香港主辦其第九次會議。RCG(A)作為FSB成員與非FSB成員溝通與合作處理金融穩定問題的重要平台，吸引了來自16個亞洲司法管轄區財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高級代表與會，討論地區面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、不當行為風險及存款保險制度的經驗。HKMA亦於八月共同主持了一場有關香港宏觀審慎政策的研討會，該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）組織，並吸引了來自全球18個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了各自在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點探討工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。HKMA亦與英國央行及國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）共同舉辦了會議，探討央行及其他政策制定者在選擇貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策最佳組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了逾百名參與者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 促進亞洲貨幣與金融穩定性\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original title emphasizes \"promoting\" (active advancement) of \"monetary and financial stability\" in Asia. Key evaluation points:  \n1. **Verb Choice:**  \n   - \"維護\" (maintain) in Translation 1 misrepresents the active \"promoting\" intent.  \n   - \"推動\" (drive forward) in Translations 2\/4 and \"促進\" (promote) in Translations 5\/6 better align with the original verb. \"促進\" is slightly more precise for \"promoting\" in policy contexts.  \n2. **Noun Form:**  \n   - \"穩定\" (stability as adjective) in Translations 1\/2\/5 is grammatically acceptable but less precise than \"穩定性\" (stability as noun), which matches the original's noun form. Translations 4\/6 use \"穩定性\" correctly.  \n3. **Structure and Flow:**  \n   - Translation 3 (\"亞洲促進...\") reverses the subject-verb order, creating awkward phrasing.  \n   - Translations 4\/6 follow natural Chinese syntax: [Verb] + [Region] + [Object].  \n4. **Cultural Appropriateness:**  \n   - The hashtag (#) in Translations 5\/6 mirrors the original format, which is acceptable in modern Chinese titles.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Retain the hashtag for consistency.  \n- Use \"促進\" for \"promoting\" to emphasize active encouragement.  \n- Use \"穩定性\" to match the noun form of \"stability.\"  \n**Final Translation:**  \n# 促進亞洲貨幣與金融穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局持續履行其對促進亞洲金融穩定及在國際金融事務中發揚地區集體聲音的區域合作倡議的承諾。作為東亞及太平洋中央銀行高級別會議（EMEAP）下設貨幣與金融穩定委員會的宏觀監測工作協調機構，金管局持續編製該委員會半年度《宏觀監測報告》，以評估地區風險與脆弱性及其政策含義。作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組主席，金管局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準與最佳實務，以及國內與跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗交流與資訊共享。同時，金管局亦領導該小組專責跨境合作與發展的子組。金管局於六月在香港主辦EMEAP\/國際清算銀行（BIS）外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議，與會者包括來自地區內17個機構及主要經濟體的代表，會議審視了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革進展。\n\n在香港與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局去年簽署《亞洲貨幣監管組織協定》後，亞洲貨幣監管組織於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在增強版多邊貨幣互換機制（CMIM）中的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局持續與國際信用評級機構保持密切溝通，以提供對香港經濟表現及財政實力的平衡評估。這些努力促成2015年所有主要信用評級機構對香港信用評級的肯定。標準普爾確認香港的最高AAA評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體擁有優於平均水平的增長前景、龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現，以及強勁的淨外資產地位。穆迪投資服務機構與惠譽評級機構亦分別將香港的評級維持於Aa1及AA+，僅低於三A級一個級別。\n\n#香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務中心\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港人民幣資金池產生影響。截至年底，人民幣客戶存款及存單餘額為1,010億元，較去年同期的1,158億元有所下降（圖1）。在境內市場利率下行背景下，離岸人民幣債券發行放緩，導致香港人民幣債券發行規模降至75億元。另一方面，香港銀行辦理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增長9%，達6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款未償餘額亦年增58%，達297億元（圖2）。人民幣實時全額清算（RTGS）系統的日均交易額增至947億元，較2014年增長29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步擴展，根據調查結果顯示，2015年4月底日均交易額約為930億美元，較2013年4月上次BIS三年一度調查時增長88%。香港仍為最大離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場深度與廣度俱佳。另一項強化此地位的重要發展是2015年7月推出的MRF計劃，該計劃擴展了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局擴展跨境人民幣資金流動渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界共同推動香港人民幣金融平台建設的努力，持續結出成果。今年六月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，允許離岸人民幣業務清算銀行及參與銀行在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得資金匯回境外，以便利銀行在離岸市場進行人民幣流動性管理。九月，中國人民銀行放寬跨境人民幣現金池管理規則，使更多跨國企業可在簡化安排下進行集團內部資金轉移。同時，內地當局於七月擴大外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金參與境內銀行間債券市場的准入，並於九月進一步開放內地外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n2015年11月30日，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）宣布自2016年10月1日起將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子。此決定確認人民幣作為可自由使用的貨幣地位，並進一步提升國際社會對人民幣在全球交易中使用的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將因人民幣進一步國際化，以及中國內地與全球經濟金融體系聯繫日益緊密，而獲得更多業務機會。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同主辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣業務論壇，並第二次與馬來西亞及泰國合作，促進私營機構就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些措施，香港銀行加強了與其他市場在人民幣業務方面的流動及聯繫，將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強市場推廣工作，透過參與香港及海外市場（包括加拿大、日本及非洲）的行業活動，推動企業及機構在貿易、投資及融資中更廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁葉國華先生於2015年12月11日出席香港－倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間，在研討會上發言。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n中國內地與香港於11月在《更緊密經貿合作安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年廣東省推出的大部分試點自由化措施擴展至全國範圍。新協議原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，預計將為這些銀行在內地經營業務提供更大的政策確定性和靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀監會的官員提供培訓課程。除涉及中央銀行業務及一般風險管理的課程外，內容還包括消費者保護、信用資料、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健性指標分析以及系統性風險監測等主題。此外，亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表團舉辦臨時培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n年內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）為機構政府債券安排了八次招標，總額為204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此嚴峻的投資環境下，外匯基金於2015年實現整體投資回報率為-0.6%，但與主要市場指數及可比投資基金相比，其虧損情況相對較為輕微。這歸功於香港金融管理局（HKMA）近年來部署的一系列防禦性措施，有效提升了外匯基金的韌性。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n根據《香港發行基金條例》，發行基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。該基金亦可用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，協助香港保持其國際金融中心的地位。發行基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢發行基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於財政司司長認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交易所基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n香港外匯基金諮詢委員會已為外匯基金訂立以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保持資本；  \n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高度流動性之美元計價資產支持；  \n(c) 確保足夠流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及  \n(d) 在(a)至(c)之前提下，實現有助於維持基金長期購買力之投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金設有兩個主要組合——後備組合及投資組合。後備組合持有高流動性的美元計價資產，以符合貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。兩大組合整體的長期目標債券與股票配置比例為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，81%的資產配置於美元及港元，其餘19%則配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以謹慎及漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外物業投資。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。HKMA在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持在外匯基金累積結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計為1,421億港元，其中私募股權為913億港元，房地產為508億港元，未償還的投資承諾金額為1,224億港元。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年成立，旨在持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府代表外匯基金以策略性目的購入。由於此組合具有特殊性質，因此未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表外匯基金根據其投資目標所確定的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以試圖在基準之上取得超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與基準（即策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準及戰術偏離的限制由財政司司長在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後決定，但戰術決策則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據授權作出。在戰術偏離所允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可根據短期市場走勢進行投資操作。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n#直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部人員直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，其中包括全部支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列組合，以及為基金實施宏觀風險管理策略而設的各種衍生工具疊加組合。\n\n# 外部經理的運用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦會委聘位於多個國際金融中心的外部基金經理，管理約24%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股權投資組合及其他專業化資產。委聘外部經理的目的，在於善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現多元化的投資風格，並傳授市場知識與資訊予內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費、托管費用、交易成本以及預扣稅款及其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外部管理的投資組合，均已建立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。風險控制工具被應用於評估正常及不利市場環境下的市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內部及外部管理者的投資專業能力。\n\n#交易所基金表現\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動劇烈，其中股市尤為突出，經歷了異常的動盪。主要股市在上半年創下新高，然而第三季因中國經濟增長擔憂，市場情緒急劇惡化，主要股市逆轉累計漲幅，錄得顯著季度虧損。其後隨市場情緒改善，全球股市有所復甦，但年底再度惡化。由於與中國內地經濟密切聯動，2015年香港股市表現劣於其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國利率將正常化並啟動利率上行週期，2015年美國長期國債收益率仍僅小幅上漲，因樂觀情緒受到全球經濟增長擔憂、持續存在的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇的制約。另一方面，由於歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策，歐洲短期政府債券收益率下跌，部分甚至跌入負值區域。\n\n在2015年外匯市場上，美元持續走強，美元指數上漲近10%，主要受市場預期美國將啟動政策利率正常化的推動。歐元在第一季度顯著貶值，創下自1999年歐元啟用以來最大的單季跌幅，原因是歐洲央行於1月宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。相比之下，日圓在2015年對美元匯率基本維持不變。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現如表一所示。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 香港外匯基金的表現\n\n在極度波動的金融市場及艱難的投資環境下，外匯基金於2015年錄得投資虧損158億港元，其中包括海外股票帶來的71億港元收益、香港股票造成的50億港元虧損、債券帶來的159億港元收益、非港元資產因貨幣翻譯效果產生的449億港元負面影響，以及基金投資控股子公司所持其他投資帶來的111億港元收益。由於去年美元大幅升值，在將外匯基金的非美元資產轉換為港元時，此負面貨幣翻譯效果在所難免。另外，戰略投資組合錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n截至2015年底，外匯基金總資產達3,422.9億港元。扣除戰略組合後，外匯基金2015年的投資回報率為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及整體投資基金界相比，外匯基金的虧損可謂相對輕微。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局近年已採取一系列防禦措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持有比例，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化步伐，特別是透過LTGP進行的投資。這些措施增強了外匯基金的韌性，並有助緩衝部分潛在損失。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年回報詳見圖表1。表2顯示2015年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均回報，包括過去三年1.2%、過去五年1.8%、過去十年3.3%及自1994年起5.0%。表3則列示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n圖表1 交易所基金投資回報（1994–2015）  \n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略投資組合的持倉。  \n2. 綜合消費者物價指數乃根據以2009\/2010年為基期的系列計算。\n"}

In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，香港金融管理局透過支持員工專業發展、推行嚴謹的財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安，以及重新調整高層管理人員職責，改善公司治理，以應對新計劃及系統實施所帶來的挑戰，以及工作日益複雜的情況。\n\n# 參與社區：企業發展\n\n#媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度及增進公眾對其政策和工作的理解。二零一五年，共舉辦五十九項公開媒體活動，包括十四場新聞發佈會、十四次即席訪問及三十一項其他公開活動。此外，另安排四十三次傳媒訪問，發佈三百二十五份中英雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為提升公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，香港金融管理局分別組織兩次媒體參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行間清算有限公司（HKICL），展示香港世界一流的鈔票印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時舉辦有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的教育研討會，為媒體提供更深入的簡報，以加深其對這些重要主題的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖（中）及執行董事（貨幣管理）李惠來（右），在媒體參觀香港印鈔有限公司期間檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n香港金融管理局於媒體參觀香港清算有限公司（HKICL）期間，展示自動化支票分類系統。照片中央（由左至右）為香港金融管理局總裁陳諾言先生、金融基礎設施執行董事李奕明先生，以及香港清算有限公司首席執行官唐慧珊女士。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供了一個有效途徑，以從香港金融管理局（HKMA）獲取資訊，使他們能更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務於2015年處理了9,078宗查詢，約一半涉及銀行政策與法規、紙幣與硬幣，以及消費者銀行業務等事項。值得注意的例子包括樓宇按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收集計劃等。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年以來接獲的公眾查詢數量，而圖表2則提供2015年按查詢性質分類的細分資料。\n\n圖表 1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除香港金融管理局（HKMA）年度報告外，香港金融管理局於過去一年亦發佈了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告、四期季度通訊，並定期更新月度統計通訊，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇《洞見》文章，涵蓋各項具時效性及針對性的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局二零一四年年報於香港管理協會二零一五年最佳年報獎的「非牟利機構及慈善組織」類別中獲得了銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供逾50,000頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取HKMA最新資訊的主要入口網站。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的「授權機構（AIs）證券從業員登記冊」及「AIs及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站將載有根據該條例設立的「儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊」。網站設有專頁及醒目快捷連結，以引導公眾關注重要及時資訊，例如提醒市民提高警惕，防止詐騙電話，以及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣推車的位置等資訊。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾教育計畫\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社區介紹金管局工作並提高公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每週開放六天。展覽區介紹金管局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展歷程，並提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料與展品，供公眾研究。\n\n資訊中心為遊客安排導覽團。本年度，該中心接待訪客逾48,300人次，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導覽活動（圖3）。自2003年12月啟用以來，已有超過530,400人次造訪資訊中心。\n\n位於展覽區旁的圖書館收藏超過二萬三千冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，維護香港授權機構的電子登記冊。\n\n為持續推廣社區聯繫計劃，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，共舉辦三場講座，約有2,300名中學生及教師參與，主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，參與人數已超過54,700人。\n\n圖表3 資訊中心各類團體訪問類型\n\n年輕的訪客在導覽員的帶領下參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n中學學生與教師參與公共教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）招募、培養並維持一支高專業素質的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的重點工作。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但它能夠以與公務員制度不同的條件聘僱員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人才。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力維持精簡而靈活的架構，並重新調配人力資源，以推動新計劃及應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年12月根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》的頒佈，在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立零售支付監察部，以履行HKMA在儲值設施及其他零售支付系統的發牌及日常監察之新法定職責。為加強部門間協同效應，並重新配置人力資源以應對新措施推行所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量與複雜性，HKMA於2015年擬訂若干部門職務重組安排，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎建設部（FID）從執法部（ENFD）及貨幣管理局（MMD）接管了存款保障計劃的管理職能與結算功能，並從銀行部門接掌與銀行業相關的工作，包括消費者教育、董事發展及銀行從業人員能力提升框架。\n\n外部部門接掌了MMD的市場開發職能，而後者將繼續處理與財政市場協會及金融基準相關的工作；\n\nENFD 接管了銀行監督部門的反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險處，並更名為執法及反洗錢處。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 人力配置\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年成立時，編制為841人。2016年增加34人至875人（增幅為4%），以確保有足夠資源應對：（一）新法例及措施的落實；（二）持續推行經證明屬必要且持續進行的試點計劃；以及（三）現有工作的複雜性及工作量不斷增加。新增職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行及金融體系的穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試流程的現場檢查、國際銀行標準的落實以及同儕審查。\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網路安全風險管理的監督。\n\n落實根據新實施之場外衍生性商品申報及記錄保存規則，針對透過銀行及核准經紀機構辦理之場外衍生性商品所建立之監理架構；\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法工作；\n\n積極推進《金融機構（處置）法案》的規劃及準備工作，該法案採用國際標準以應對金融業「大而不倒」問題。\n\n透過制定針對銀行獨立非執行董事的董事賦能計劃，以提升銀行治理水平，並與業界合作，推動銀行從業人員在銀行核心業務領域的專業能力框架建設，進一步促進銀行業的能力建設。\n\n加強在新興銀行、證券及保險產品方面的銀行行為準則政策與研究能力。\n\n加強消費者保護與消費者教育的力度；並\n\n加強對境內人民幣市場及CNH市場的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強投資、風險管理及法律支持，以應對與未來基金設立及交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化相關的擴展投資活動，並在日益嚴峻的投資環境下，提升策略性資產配置及投資流程。\n\n實施新的法定制度，賦權香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監管儲值設施及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業功能\n\n臨時資源會根據其他工作需求進行調派。香港金融管理局（HKMA）會將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或HKMA感興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分員工以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障局及財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪資審核機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）會根據治理小組委員會（GSC）的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並參考現行市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬包及強制性公積金計劃，實物福利極為有限。總現金薪酬包由每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及變動薪金組成，變動薪金會根據員工表現，每年以一次性形式發放給個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局員工的薪酬每年由財政司根據公務員薪酬委員會透過職位評估常設委員會提出的建議進行審閱，並會考慮公務員薪酬委員會對香港金融管理局上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問機構就金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，以及其他任何相關因素。為維持薪酬競爭力，偶爾亦可針對個別表現卓越的員工作出特別薪酬調整。\n\n任何經批准的固定薪酬年度調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工個人表現發放至香港金管局（HKMA）個別員工。HKMA的投資專業人員適用變動薪酬制度，旨在強化其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。職級為總經理或以上之員工薪酬調整或獎勵，須由財務服務（FS）根據總監理委員會（GSC）建議批准，有關員工在討論其薪酬時並不在場。職級為部門主管或以下之員工薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金管局首席執行官根據財務服務（FS）授予之權力，在經批准之整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告  \n外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計主任報告\n\n# 審計委員會  \n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n#獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人謹此證明，已審核載於第134至222頁的聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）財務報表，該等財務報表包括聯匯基金及本集團截至2015年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收入及支出表、綜合收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並附有重要會計政策摘要及其他說明資料。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局須根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條頒發的指示，以及香港財務報告準則，編製真實公允的財務報表，並制定其認為必要以確保財務報表免受重大錯報影響的內部控制措施，不論該等錯報係因舞弊或錯誤所致。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據審計結果，對這些財務報表發表意見。我進行審計時，遵守了行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條所發出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準。這些標準要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃及執行審計工作，以取得合理保證，確保財務報表沒有重大錯報。\n\n審計包括執行程序以取得財務報表中金額及披露事項的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括對財務報表存在重大錯報風險的評估，無論該風險係源自舞弊或錯誤。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與被審計單位編製能提供真實及公允觀點的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適合特定情況的審計程序，但並非用以對被審計單位內部控制的有效性發表意見。審計亦包括評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策之適當性及所作出的會計估計之合理性，以及評估財務報表之整體列報。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據已足夠且適當，足以作為我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計長報告（續）\n\n# 意見\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公允地反映截至2015年12月31日儲備基金及本集團之財務狀況，以及該年度之財務表現及現金流量，並已按照香港財務報告準則編製，且符合行政長官根據《交換基金條例》第7條所頒佈之指示。\n\n孫大衛  \n審計總監\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會  \n香港灣仔告士威路7號入境大廈26樓\n\n# 目錄\n\n收支帳戶  \n綜合收益表  \n資產負債表  \n股東權益變動表  \n現金流量表  \n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務活動  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變更  \n4. 收入與支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產及金融負債類別  \n7. 現金及隨時可用資金  \n8. 存放於銀行及其他金融機構  \n9. 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產  \n10. 可供出售證券  \n11. 衍生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期日證券  \n13. 貸款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 於子公司之權益  \n17. 於聯營公司及合營企業之權益  \n18. 投資性不動產  \n19. 物業、廠房及設備  \n20. 債券、政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣  \n21. 銀行體系餘額  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構之存放  \n23. 財政儲備存放  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存放  \n25. 發行之外匯基金債券及票據  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 其他已發行債務證券  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股本  \n30. 現金流量表內現金及現金等價物分析  \n31. 營運部門呈報資料  \n32. 質押資產  \n33. 承諾  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重大關聯方交易  \n36. 金融風險管理  \n37. 金融工具之公允價值衡量  \n38. 會計期間後非調整性事項  \n39. 截至2015年12月31日止年度尚未生效之修正、新標準及詮釋可能產生的影響  \n40. 財務報表核准\n\n# 外匯基金 – 收入及支出帳戶\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 綜合收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 兌換基金 – 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n陳諾文  \n香港金融管理局  \n2016年4月7日\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 股東權益變動表\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original term \"Exchange Fund\" presents a key translation challenge. While \"交換基金\" (Exchange Fund) is a literal translation, it lacks contextual specificity. In financial contexts, \"Exchange Fund\" typically refers to a **foreign exchange fund** (外匯基金), which aligns with standard terminology in Chinese financial reporting. Translations like \"儲備基金\" (Reserve Fund) or \"財政儲備\" (Financial Reserve) are imprecise, as they imply different purposes. \"匯豐基金\" (HSBC Fund) and \"投資基金\" (Investment Fund) are entirely unrelated to the original term.  \nFor \"Statement of Changes in Equity,\" the most accurate translation is **股東權益變動表** (Shareholders' Equity Changes Statement). While \"權益變動表\" (Equity Changes Statement) is grammatically correct, it omits the critical term \"股東\" (shareholders), which is standard in financial statements to specify the nature of equity. The sixth junior translator’s use of \"股東權益變動表\" is the most precise, though \"外匯基金\" (Foreign Exchange Fund) is preferable to \"交換基金\" (Exchange Fund) for clarity and alignment with official terminology.  \n**Improvements:**  \n1. Use **外匯基金** for \"Exchange Fund\" to reflect its financial context.  \n2. Use **股東權益變動表** for \"Statement of Changes in Equity\" to ensure specificity and adherence to accounting standards.  \n3. Maintain the **#** symbol as it is standard in Chinese financial headings.  \nThe final translation balances accuracy, contextual appropriateness, and adherence to financial terminology norms.\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 現金流量表\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original term \"Exchange Fund\" requires precise translation. Among the options, \"結匯基金\" (Settlement Fund) and \"交換基金\" (Exchange Fund) are direct translations, but neither fully captures the financial context. \"儲備基金\" (Reserve Fund) and \"財政儲備\" (Financial Reserve) are broader terms, while \"投資基金\" (Investment Fund) is unrelated. The most accurate term in Chinese financial terminology is **外匯基金** (Foreign Exchange Fund), which directly corresponds to \"Exchange Fund\" in the context of currency management. \"現金流量表\" (Statement of Cash Flows) is correctly translated in all versions. Thus, the optimal translation combines precision and contextual accuracy.\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n# 外匯基金 – 現金流量表（續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（金額以百萬港元表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 1 主要活動\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長授予的權限，作為外匯基金（「基金」）的管理人，依照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是維護港元的匯兌價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產分為四個投資組合進行管理：後備組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。後備組合的資產完全匹配香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有香港特別行政區政府（HKSAR）為基金戰略目的而購入的香港交易所及結算所有限公司股份。營運部門資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 2. 重大會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs 為一統稱，涵蓋所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）所頒佈的解釋，並符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（合稱為「集團」）採用的重要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新訂及修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於本期會計期間首次生效或可供提前採用。附註3載列本集團因首次採用這些準則而導致的會計政策變更（如有），並說明這些變更對本期及過往會計期間所反映財務報表的相關影響。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以百萬港元表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司及合營企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表所採用的衡量基礎為歷史成本，惟下列資產及負債按其公允價值列示，如以下會計政策所述：\n\n交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；黃金（附註2.11）；及投資性不動產（附註2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的應用，以及資產、負債、收入及費用的報告金額。這些估計及相關假設基於經驗及其他在當時情況下認為合理的因素，其結果構成了評估資產及負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非可從其他來源直接得知。實際結果可能與這些估計存在差異。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行審查。若會計估計的修訂僅影響當期，則應於該修訂所屬會計期間認列；若修訂同時影響當期及未來期間，則應於修訂所屬會計期間及未來各期認列。\n\n附註18載有與投資性不動產公允價值估值相關的假設資訊。附註37載有與金融工具公允價值估值相關的假設資訊。除附註2.5所述特定金融工具的估值外，集團會計政策的應用中不涉及任何關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及少數權益\n\n子公司是指由集團控制之實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因參與該實體而暴露於或擁有來自該實體之變動回報，且能透過其對該實體之控制權影響該等回報。評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他各方所持有）。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以百萬港元表示，除非另有說明。）\n\n對子公司的投資，自取得控制權之日起至喪失控制權之日止，均併入本集團財務報表。\n\n在編製集團財務報表時，集團內部的餘額、交易及現金流量，以及源自集團內部交易的任何未實現利潤及虧損，均會完全抵銷。\n\n非控制權益指子公司中未直接或間接歸屬於基金的股權，且集團與該等權益持有人之間未另行達成任何條款，導致集團整體對該等權益負有符合財務負債定義的契約義務。非控制權益於集團資產負債表中，以權益項目單獨列示，與歸屬於基金所有者的權益分開。集團的非控制權益在損益表及綜合收益表中，以年度盈虧及總綜合收益或虧損在非控制權益與基金所有者之間的分配方式列示。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去減值損失（如有）列示（附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 關聯企業與合資企業\n\n聯營公司係指集團透過參與其財務及營運政策決策之權力，對其管理具有重大影響力，而非控制或共同控制之實體。\n"}
