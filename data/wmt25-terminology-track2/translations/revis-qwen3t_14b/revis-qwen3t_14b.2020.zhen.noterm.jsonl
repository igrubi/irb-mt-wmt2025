{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n","en":"# CEO Report\n\n2020 was a year beyond imagination.\n\nThe global outbreak of the novel coronavirus has caught the world off guard, bringing economic activity to a near standstill worldwide. Under the pandemic's impact, Hong Kong's economy contracted for the second consecutive year following 2019, recording its largest drop on record in gross domestic product. The unemployment rate surged to a 16-year high, with certain industries particularly hard hit.\n\nHowever, adversity often reveals our true strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems have once again successfully withstood the impact. This was by no means accidental, but rather the result of our consistently prudent policies over the years.  \nHowever, adversity often reveals our true strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems have once again successfully withstood the impact. This was by no means accidental, but rather the result of our consistently prudent policies over the years.\n\nThe path to recovery is unlikely to be smooth. Even as central banks and governments worldwide strive to support the economy, the outlook remains fraught with uncertainty, encompassing central banks' monetary policy stances, the progress of vaccination programs, and the potential impact of a prolonged low-interest-rate environment. Meanwhile, the ongoing evolution of geopolitical tensions introduces further variables into the macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDespite facing such uncertain circumstances, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to diligently fulfill its responsibilities, maintaining monetary and financial stability and creating a favorable environment for economic recovery. At the same time, in the ever-evolving banking and financial landscape, we will strive to seize opportunities and enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Monetary and Financial Stability: Steadfast as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) continued to operate smoothly and orderly in 2020. Since its implementation in 1983, the LERS has weathered numerous challenges, fully demonstrating its resilience against shocks. Despite the pandemic and a volatile macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The strong-side exchange guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times, resulting in a cumulative inflow of approximately HKD 383.5 billion.\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System has remained stable, thanks to the solid foundation established over the years. As summarized in the IMF's 2020 External Sector Report, the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System is built upon highly transparent operational rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation, a flexible economy, and prudent fiscal policies. At the same time, the HKMA has swiftly dispelled rumors and provided the public with the latest facts and data through close engagement with the industry and effective communication via traditional and social media. The HKMA also leverages the latest technology and data analytics to continuously enhance its monitoring capabilities, enabling it to flexibly respond to the latest market developments and emerging risks.\n\nAlthough the pandemic exerted significant pressure on the economy, the banking system remained sound, with ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.7%, far exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. The average liquidity coverage ratio of major banks was also significantly higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Affected by the pandemic, the quality of banks' assets slightly deteriorated, with the specific classified loan ratio rising to 0.9% by the end of 2020. However, this remained sound and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: The Lifeline of the Economy\n\nThe banking system plays a crucial role as a financial intermediary in the economy and society. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to focus on supervising banks' credit and liquidity risks while closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. It implemented various measures to ensure the banking system could continue providing essential services and offering loan support to the economy. In March, the HKMA reduced the countercyclical buffer capital ratio by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April, it lowered regulatory reserve requirements. These measures collectively freed up approximately HK$1 trillion in additional lending capacity for the banking system.\n\nWe are fully aware that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may face cash flow pressures under the current economic environment. To address this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the banking sector, established the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in 2019 and introduced multiple relief measures, including the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Payment Without Principal Repayment\" scheme, which deferred principal repayments for all eligible enterprises' loans by six months. By the end of 2020, banks had processed over 58,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures, involving a total amount exceeding HKD 740 billion. Given the recurring outbreaks of the pandemic, the HKMA extended the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Payment Without Principal Repayment\" scheme in March 2021, prolonging it until the end of October 2021. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited also launched the \"100% Guaranteed Special Loan\" under its SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to alleviate SMEs' burdens in paying employee salaries and rent. By the end of 2020, over 25,000 applications had been approved, involving approximately HKD 40 billion. The scheme was optimized in the first quarter of 2021, with the application period extended to December 31, 2021. Throughout the year, banks also processed over 28,000 relief measure applications, assisting individual customers with cash flow needs, involving a total amount of HKD 44 billion. The banking sector's united efforts in supporting both businesses and individual customers through these challenging times are truly encouraging.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the banking sector's efforts to enhance financial inclusion and foster a customer-centric culture. We further encourage banks to pay particular attention to vulnerable customers and to share best practices in various areas, including providing banking services for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as offering more accessible and user-friendly banking services.\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, the operating environment of the banking industry has undergone swift transformation. Therefore, the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is not limited to addressing current challenges but also requires looking ahead, expanding the talent pool to align with the future development of the banking sector. We have jointly launched the \"Enhancing the Professional Competence of Future Banking Talent\" research initiative with the Hong Kong Bankers Association and the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, aiming to assess potential talent gaps in the banking industry over the next few years and provide banks with a clear roadmap to proactively address future talent supply issues. Additionally, we have introduced the \"Banking Talent Launchpad Program,\" offering recent graduates from local universities a six-month internship and specialized training related to the banking industry, thereby cultivating talent for the sector. Launching this program during a challenging period in the local labor market also provides opportunities for young people eager to enter the banking industry.\n\n# Status as an International Financial Center: Unfazed by Challenges\n\nTo fulfill one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s key responsibilities—supporting the consolidation of Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center—our future planning encompasses the banking system and the entire financial system, aiming to ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center in an evolving financial landscape. Throughout the pandemic, we continued to steadily advance these efforts while proactively exploring new opportunities in several key areas to fully capitalize on the opportunities presented by emerging trends and transformations.\n\n# Drive Green Finance, Forge a More Sustainable Future\n\nThe first category involves promoting green and sustainable finance. Since the introduction of a three-phase initiative in May 2019, notable progress has been achieved. In 2020, we completed the \"Green Benchmarks\" assessment of 47 banks, published a white paper, and issued notices to provide guidance and share experiences on how banks can manage climate risks. We are also fully committed to advancing the second phase of the work, establishing a regulatory framework for the banking sector to manage climate risks. Furthermore, we will strive to require banks to disclose climate-related information in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 at the latest. This will make Hong Kong the first region in Asia to implement such specific requirements.\n\nAs one of the world’s largest reserve managers, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the processes of selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. We also practice what we preach by making ESG investments, including investments in green, social, and sustainable bonds as well as low-carbon projects.  \nAs one of the world’s largest reserve managers, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the processes of selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. We also practice what we preach by making ESG investments, including investments in green, social, and sustainable bonds as well as low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong’s green finance ecosystem, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently supported the government in issuing green bonds, with the recently launched second batch of government green bonds receiving particularly strong international investor interest. Capitalizing on this momentum, the Financial Secretary announced in the “2021–22 Budget” that the government would expand the “Government Green Bond Programme,” doubling the borrowing limit to HK$200 billion and increasing the variety and issuance channels of future green bonds.\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance, a key component of our overall strategy is to collaborate with local regulatory bodies and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in conjunction with other regulators, has established a cross-agency steering group on green and sustainable finance to coordinate relevant measures within the financial sector. This group has developed a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, the HKMA, at the invitation of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), has become a founding member and the first regional executive council member of the Asia region of the \"Green Banking Alliance,\" working together to promote the alliance’s mission. The alliance aims to promote green banking in global financial markets, starting in Asia and gradually expanding to other regions.\n\nWe expect the aforementioned initiatives to help mitigate climate risks faced by the financial sector and enable Hong Kong banks to leverage their strengths in meeting the region's substantial funding needs for green investments.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translations all capture the core meaning but vary in precision and fluency. Key strengths include consistent use of \"leverage their strengths\" (a natural phrasing) and accurate rendering of \"substantial funding needs\/demand.\" However, weaknesses include:  \n1. **Verb Choice:** \"Reduce\" (used in translations 1, 3, 6) is less precise than \"mitigate\" (translation 2) for climate risks, which often carry complex, systemic implications.  \n2. **Redundancy:** \"Green investment capital\" (translation 2) and \"funding needs of green investments\" (translation 6) are unnecessarily wordy; \"funding needs for green investments\" is more concise.  \n3. **Formality:** \"The aforementioned work\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is slightly less formal than \"the aforementioned initiatives,\" which better matches the original's \"工作\" (work\/initiatives) in a policy context.  \n4. **Clarity:** \"Promote Hong Kong banks to leverage\" (translation 4) is grammatically awkward; \"enable\" or \"encourage\" is more natural.  \nThe improved translation integrates the strongest elements: \"mitigate\" for precision, \"initiatives\" for formality, and streamlined phrasing to avoid redundancy while maintaining clarity and natural flow.\n\n# FinTech brings convenience to citizens and benefits the economy.\n\nAnother major driver of growth in the financial sector is fintech, and the pace of development in this area has accelerated further during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe past year has clearly demonstrated that fintech can expand our \"toolkit\" to address sudden shocks. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic payment channels played an unprecedented role. From its launch in September 2018 to the end of 2020, the Fast Payment System (\"FPS\"), known as \"TransferFast,\" had already registered 6.9 million accounts. Even under social distancing measures, the public could still use \"TransferFast\" as a secure, fast, and reliable method for making payments and transferring funds, leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the system's average daily transaction volume in 2020. We have also been working with the government to expand the application of \"TransferFast\" to cover more types of government and public service bills.\n\nIn addition, fintech also helps banks offer more diversified and convenient banking services to customers. All eight virtual banks licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have fully commenced operations in Hong Kong this year. As of the end of 2020, a total of 420,000 accounts had been opened with virtual banks, with aggregate customer deposits amounting to HK$15 billion. Some of these virtual banks have already begun using new types of data for credit assessments to target new customer segments and promote financial inclusion. The HKMA continues to promote the development of a larger and more diversified regulatory technology (RegTech) ecosystem in Hong Kong as part of its \"Banking Easy\" initiative, aiming to streamline regulatory requirements and enhance customer experience. In addition to issuing a series of communications to raise industry awareness of RegTech applications, the HKMA has also published a white paper outlining a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of RegTech in the banking sector. Furthermore, the HKMA has launched the \"Commercial Data Interchange\" project to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to more conveniently access banking financing by leveraging their own digital footprints.\n\nThe landscape of financial technology is evolving rapidly, with technological applications becoming increasingly widespread. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must continue to uphold rigorous regulation. To this end, we have launched the \"Cyber Defense Plan 2.0\" to enhance banks' cybersecurity capabilities. We have also strengthened on-site reviews of technology risk management and established a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of personal loan products utilizing innovative credit risk assessment methods. The HKMA has also initiated a three-year plan to apply regulatory technology, aiming to improve the effectiveness and forward-looking nature of regulatory processes. Current efforts focus on more effectively leveraging data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering regulations.\n"}

The labor market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. To address the severe economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced relief measures to support the economy.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong's banking system remains robust, with a sound financial position and continued growth in deposits. Capital and liquidity remain ample, and asset quality remains at a stable level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the increased uncertainty brought about by the pandemic, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets operated smoothly and in an orderly manner, reflecting the continued stability of Hong Kong’s monetary system. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for much of 2020, triggering the Convertibility Undertaking on multiple occasions. This fully demonstrates the robustness of the linked exchange rate system and the market’s confidence in it.\n\n#banking system stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on banking operations while prioritizing the supervision of banks' credit and liquidity risk management. Given the ongoing rise in cyber risks and the industry's accelerated adoption of technology, the HKMA has strengthened its oversight of banks' technology risk management and operational resilience, as well as consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has granted banks flexibility to continue providing services to customers during the pandemic. The HKMA has also collaborated with other relevant authorities to develop implementation guidelines for the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" pilot program, as well as to provide guidance on family offices and wealth management services.\n\nIn combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has swiftly taken action, not only clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help banks more effectively address situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continues to promote public-private information sharing and supports the banking industry's adoption of compliance technology.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core message but vary in accuracy, terminology, and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Institutional Name:** Translators 2 and 6 incorrectly use \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" or omit \"Hong Kong\" from \"Monetary Authority,\" which is critical for clarity.  \n2. **Terminology:** \"RegTech\" (Translation 1) and \"regulatory technology\" (Translation 2) are industry terms, but \"compliance technology\" (Translations 3–6) better aligns with the original’s focus on banking compliance.  \n3. **Tense and Nuance:** \"Swiftly took action\" (Translation 4) uses past tense, while the original implies ongoing efforts. Present perfect (\"has swiftly taken action\") or present tense (\"continues to promote\") better reflects the context.  \n4. **Fluency:** Phrases like \"information sharing among public-private partnerships\" (Translation 4) are awkward; \"public-private information sharing\" is more concise.  \n5. **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"Prudently\" (Translations 1, 3, 5) and \"carefully\" (Translation 5) are both acceptable, but \"prudently\" aligns better with regulatory contexts.  \nThe improved translation above integrates the most accurate terminology, corrects institutional names, ensures consistent tense, and maintains fluency while preserving the original’s emphasis on proactive measures and ongoing collaboration.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce multiple new rules and regulations this year to strengthen the regulatory framework of the banking system, aligning with the latest international standards. In the area of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second phase of a three-phase approach and is currently developing the relevant regulatory requirements. The Authority is also committed to establishing resolution standards, conducting resolution planning, and building resolution execution capabilities to ensure Hong Kong has a credible banking resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe junior translations all capture the core meaning but exhibit minor inconsistencies. The primary issues are: (1) inconsistent capitalization of \"Status\" (should be lowercase unless starting a sentence or title), (2) mixed use of \"Center\" vs. \"Centre\" (both acceptable but \"Center\" is more common in international contexts), and (3) unnecessary hashtag inclusion (#) which is not standard in formal English titles. The sixth translation correctly uses lowercase \"status\" and \"center\" but lacks the title case consistency expected for headings. The optimal approach balances standard English conventions with the original's intent, using \"Center\" with proper title case and omitting the hashtag.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the development of the fintech ecosystem, with banks and the payment industry increasingly adopting fintech solutions. Transaction volume on the fast payment system \"FPS\" has surged rapidly. The HKMA is actively participating in cross-border cooperation in areas such as central bank digital currencies.\n\nHong Kong’s position as a global offshore RMB hub remains solid, and it continues to serve as the primary gateway to mainland China. Financial ties between Hong Kong and the mainland continue to strengthen through its world-class market infrastructure and mutual connectivity mechanisms. Good progress has also been made this year in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong's financial platform, including strengthening the competitiveness of corporate treasury centers in asset and wealth management, as well as in the areas of green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nDespite the complex and volatile investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$235.8 billion in investment income in 2020, achieving a return rate of 5.3%, with all five major investment classes posting positive returns.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 13.7% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\n# Institutional Functions and Social Responsibilities\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to maintain effective communication with society and the market through various channels, enhancing public understanding of its policies and operations. In performing its duties, the HKMA upheld high standards of corporate governance, supporting employees in enhancing their professional capabilities, implementing strict financial controls, and strengthening information technology capabilities and security to address new challenges and projects, as well as an increasingly demanding workload.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to fulfill its institutional social responsibilities, aiming to become a responsible and sustainable institution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA implemented special work arrangements to ensure the continued normal operation of its essential functions while safeguarding the health of its staff. The HKMA also introduced a number of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic.  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in terminology and fluency. Key strengths include consistent use of \"HKMA\" (critical for institutional accuracy), appropriate terms like \"institutional social responsibilities\" (more precise than \"corporate\"), and clear causal links (e.g., \"to mitigate the adverse impacts\"). Weaknesses include inconsistent use of \"corporate\" vs. \"institutional,\" awkward phrasing like \"continued normal operation\" (better as \"continued normal functioning\"), and minor redundancy (e.g., \"safeguarding the health of its staff\" vs. \"safeguarding employee health\"). Translation 6 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of HKMA, which is a critical error. The best version combines clarity, precision, and natural phrasing while respecting institutional terminology and formal tone.\n"}

Events in 2020\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# April 9th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced that it will reduce the issuance of HK$200 billion in Exchange Fund Notes to increase overall Hong Kong dollar liquidity in the interbank market, thereby helping to ensure the smooth functioning of the Hong Kong dollar interbank market amid volatility in the global macroeconomic environment caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n# April 22nd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has announced the establishment of a temporary USD liquidity arrangement to provide liquidity support to licensed banks and alleviate liquidity stress in the global USD interbank lending market.\n\n# October 23rd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the designation of nine authorized institutions as primary liquidity providers in Hong Kong's offshore RMB market.\n\n# November25th\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at these translations. The original text is about the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority renewing a currency swap agreement with an expanded scale. The key points are the names of the institutions, the duration of the agreement, and the amounts in both RMB and HKD.\nFirst, checking the names: all translations correctly use \"People's Bank of China (PBOC)\" and \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" except the second and sixth translators. The second one just says \"Monetary Authority\" without specifying Hong Kong, which is a bit vague. The sixth one says \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" but omits the acronym, which is less precise. So, the first, third, fourth, and fifth translators are correct here.\nNext, the duration: \"five-year\" is correctly used in all translations. The structure \"for a period of five years\" is also acceptable, as in the third and sixth translations. However, the first, fourth, and fifth use \"a five-year currency swap agreement,\" which is more concise and natural.\nNow, the amounts. The original text says 4,000 billion yuan (4,700 billion HKD) to 5,000 billion yuan (5,900 billion HKD). But looking at the translations, there's a mix of 400 billion, 4,000 billion, etc. Wait, the original uses \"4,000億元\" which is 4,000 billion yuan, but in the translations, some have 400 billion. That's a critical error. The original is 4,000 billion, not 400. So the second, third, and sixth translators have 400 billion, which is a mistake. The first, fourth, and fifth have 4,000 billion, which is correct. However, the original also has \"4,700億港元\" which is 4,700 billion HKD, but some translations have 470 billion. That's another error. The first and fourth translators have 4,700 billion, which is correct. The fifth has 470 billion, which is wrong. The sixth has 4,700 billion but then 5,900 billion, which is correct. Wait, the original is 4,700 billion HKD and 5,900 billion HKD. So the first, fourth, and sixth have the correct figures. The second, third, and fifth have 47 billion and 59 billion, which is off by a factor of ten. That's a major mistake.\nAlso, the use of \"RMB\" vs. \"yuan\" and \"HKD\" vs. \"Hong Kong dollars.\" The original uses \"人民幣\" which is RMB, and \"港元\" which is HKD. The translations should use \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" for consistency with financial terminology. The first, fourth, and fifth use \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" correctly. The second and third use \"yuan\" and \"Hong Kong dollars,\" which is acceptable but less formal. The sixth uses \"yuan\" and \"Hong Kong dollars\" but with the correct figures.\nAnother point is the structure of the sentences. The original says \"已續簽為期5年的貨幣互換協議\" which is \"have renewed a five-year currency swap agreement.\" The first, third, fourth, and fifth use \"have renewed\" or \"announced the renewal,\" which is correct. The second and sixth use \"have announced the renewal,\" which is also correct but slightly different in structure.\nThe verb \"擴大至\" is translated as \"expanded to\" or \"expanded from... to...\" which is correct. The use of \"scale\" vs. \"size\" is a minor point. \"Scale\" is more commonly used in financial contexts, so \"scale\" is better. The first, third, fourth, and fifth use \"scale,\" while the second and sixth use \"size.\" However, the sixth uses \"size\" but with the correct figures.\nPutting it all together, the correct translation should have the correct figures (4,000 billion RMB to 5,000 billion RMB and 4,700 billion HKD to 5,900 billion HKD), use \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" for currency, and use \"scale\" instead of \"size.\" The first, fourth, and sixth translators have the correct figures but some inconsistencies in currency abbreviations. The fifth has the correct figures but uses \"RMB\" and \"HK$,\" which is acceptable but \"HKD\" is more standard. The first and fourth use \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" correctly. The sixth uses \"yuan\" and \"Hong Kong dollars\" but with the correct figures.\nSo the best translation would combine the correct figures from the first, fourth, and sixth, use \"RMB\" and \"HKD,\" and use \"scale\" instead of \"size.\" Also, the structure should be concise and natural, like the first translation but with the correct figures. Wait, the first translation has \"4,000 billion yuan (470 billion HKD)\" which is incorrect. The original is 4,700 billion HKD. So the first translation has a mistake in the HKD amount. The fourth translation has \"4,000 billion RMB (4,700 billion HKD)\" which is correct. The fifth has \"RMB 400 billion (HK$470 billion)\" which is wrong. The sixth has \"400 billion yuan (4,700 billion Hong Kong dollars)\" which is also wrong. So the fourth translation is the only one with correct figures. However, the fourth uses \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" correctly. The fifth uses \"RMB\" and \"HK$\" which is acceptable but \"HKD\" is more standard. The first translation has the correct figures but uses \"yuan\" and \"HKD\" with the correct numbers. Wait, the first translation says \"4,000 billion yuan (470 billion HKD)\" which is incorrect. The original is 4,700 billion HKD. So the first translation is wrong. The fourth translation has \"4,000 billion RMB (4,700 billion HKD)\" which is correct. The fifth has \"RMB 400 billion (HK$470 billion)\" which is wrong. The sixth has \"400 billion yuan (4,700 billion Hong Kong dollars)\" which is also wrong. So the fourth translation is the only one with correct figures. However, the fourth translation uses \"RMB\" and \"HKD\" correctly.

The junior translations exhibit several issues:  \n1. **Company Name Accuracy**: Most translations incorrectly use \"Mortgage Corporation\" instead of \"Mortgage Securities Limited\" (the full name in parentheses is \"按揭證券公司,\" which directly translates to \"Mortgage Securities Company\").  \n2. **Program Terminology**: \"Trial Scheme\" and \"Pilot Program\" are both acceptable, but \"Pilot Program\" is more standard in formal announcements.  \n3. **Fluency and Structure**: Some translations split the launch and application process into separate clauses, reducing conciseness.  \n**Improvements**: Use the full legal name \"Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company)\" for clarity. Opt for \"Pilot Program\" as the standard term. Combine the launch and application process into a single, fluid sentence.  \nHong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited (Mortgage Securities Company) has launched its \"Fixed Rate Mortgage Pilot Program\" and has begun accepting applications.\n\n# May 8th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued a consultation paper on the implementation of a mandatory background check scheme to mitigate the risk of authorized institutions hiring individuals with a history of misconduct.\n\n# May 22\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has published a comprehensive report titled \"Review of Self-Assessment of Bank Culture,\" providing the industry with a series of practices for reference.\n\n# May 29\n\nAnzen Insurance Company announced the optimization measures for the \"80% and 90% Credit Guarantee Products\" under the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme,\" which take effect immediately.\n\n# June 4th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the joint launch of the \"Banking Industry Talent Activation Program\" with the banking sector to provide recent university graduates with short-term job opportunities and professional training during the pandemic.\n\n# June 30th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority published the Green and Sustainable Banking White Paper, outlining its preliminary thoughts on the regulatory approach to climate-related matters.\n\n# July 10th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is consulting the industry on proposals to strengthen the regulation of trust business.\n\n# July 31st\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to banks on simplified arrangements for the sale of eligible retail bonds issued by the government and related organizations.\n\n# August 5th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in the banking sector, announced the extension of the repayment period for trade financing loans under the \"Pre-Approved Interest-Only Repayment Plan\" by 90 days.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Insurance Authority have collaborated to provide guidance to the industry on the regulatory requirements for using video conferencing to sell long-term insurance products.\n\n# August 20th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has relaxed the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential property mortgage loans, raising the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for such loans.

Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology:** \"Pre-approved interest-only repayment\" (Translations 1, 5) is more precise than \"Principal Repayment Deferral\" (Translation 3) or \"Principal Payment Holiday Scheme\" (Translation 4), which misrepresent the original's focus on interest-only terms.  \n2. **Mechanism Name:** \"SME Loan Coordination Mechanism for the Banking Industry\" (Translation 2) is clearer than \"Small and Medium Enterprise Loan Coordination Mechanism in the banking sector\" (Translation 6), which is redundant.  \n3. **Fluency:** \"Extension for six months until April 30, 2021\" (Translation 1) is smoother than \"for another six months\" (Translation 6), which implies prior extensions not stated in the original.  \n4. **Consistency:** Using \"plan\" (Translation 1) aligns with the original's \"計劃\" (plan), while \"scheme\" (Translations 2, 3, 4) is acceptable but less direct.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe final version combines clarity, conciseness, and fidelity to the original, using \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" for accuracy, \"Banking Industry SME Loan Coordination Mechanism\" for precision, and \"until\" for natural phrasing.\n\n# September 4th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a notice requiring banks to implement enhanced disclosure measures, providing \"dual prompts\" to retail individual customers and small and medium-sized enterprise customers applying for unsecured loans and credit card products through digital platforms.\n\n#September18th\n\nThe original text outlines adjustments to a Hong Kong government loan scheme for SMEs. The junior translations all capture the core information but vary in terminology, structure, and fluency. Key observations:\n**Strengths:**  \n- All translations correctly identify the scheme name (\"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\") and the loan type (\"100% Guaranteed Loan\/Preferential Loan\").  \n- The numerical details (12 months' salaries\/rent, HK$5 million, 5-year repayment) are consistently accurate.  \n- The phrase \"whichever is lower\" is universally used, reflecting the original's conditional structure.  \n**Weaknesses:**  \n1. **Terminology Inconsistency:**  \n   - \"100% Guaranteed Loan\" vs. \"100% Guarantee Preferential Loan\" vs. \"100% Guarantee Concessionary Loan\" – \"Preferential\" is more precise for government-subsidized loans, while \"Concessionary\" and \"Special\" are less standard.  \n   - \"SME\" vs. \"Small and Medium Enterprise\" – the latter is more formal and aligns with official Hong Kong government terminology.  \n2. **Structural Clarity:**  \n   - Some translations invert the scheme name and loan program (e.g., starting with \"100% Guarantee Preferential Loan\" instead of the overarching scheme). This risks ambiguity.  \n   - The use of \"under\" vs. \"of the\" for subprograms affects readability.  \n3. **Fluency and Style:**  \n   - \"12 months of employee salaries and rent\" is grammatically correct but less idiomatic than \"12 months' employee salaries and rent\" (possessive form).  \n   - \"HK$5 million\" is preferable to \"HKD 5 million\" for currency formatting.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Use the full, official name: \"Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Scheme.\"  \n- Specify the loan as a \"100% Guarantee Preferential Loan\" to reflect its subsidized nature.  \n- Prioritize clarity by placing the main scheme name first, followed by the subprogram.  \n- Adopt possessive phrasing (\"12 months' employee salaries and rent\") and standard currency notation (\"HK$5 million\").  \n**Final Translation:**  \nUnder the Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Guarantee Scheme, the maximum loan amount for the 100% Guarantee Preferential Loan per enterprise has been increased to the sum of 12 months' employee salaries and rent, or HK$5 million, whichever is lower; the maximum repayment period has been extended to 5 years.\n\n# September 29\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published a report titled \"Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Regulation in the Era of Digital Innovation,\" outlining how it will enhance the application of data and regulatory technology in its risk-based anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CTF) regulatory efforts as part of its digitalization initiative.\n\n# September 30th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority shared key observations and good practices with the industry concerning its mystery shopper program for retail banks selling investment and insurance products.\n\n# November 2nd\n\nMortgage Securities Company announced that the application period for its Fixed-Rate Mortgage Pilot Program will be extended by one year to October 30, 2021.\n\n# November 3rd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched a two-year initiative to promote the adoption of RegTech by local banks, as outlined in the white paper titled \"Leveraging the Power of Compliance Technology: Transforming Risk Management and Compliance.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the launch of the \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0,\" aiming to reflect the latest trends in technological development and incorporate the most recent global practices in cyber risk management, thereby enhancing the banking sector's cyber defence capabilities to a higher level.\n\n# December 15\n\nWith the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Hong Kong Bankers' Association and the Deposit-taking Companies Association jointly issued the \"Guidelines on Banking Services for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities,\" outlining recommended principles and best practices to provide banking services to clients in need.\n\n# December 18th\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong (HKMA) has announced the launch of the \"Operational Risk Management\" module within the Banking Professional Qualifications Framework, aimed at advancing talent development in the banking sector and enhancing the professional capabilities of industry practitioners.\n\n# December 23rd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides guidance to banks on offering investment services through non-face-to-face channels and simplifying the disclosure of investment products for non-retail banking customers who are familiar with investments.\n\n# December 31st\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published a consultation summary on its proposal to establish, under section 92 of the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance (Cap. 628), rules suspending the termination rights of financial contracts applicable to authorized institutions in the form of subsidiary legislation.

The FATF is the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering, headquartered in Paris, France.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Institutional Name:** The third and sixth translations incorrectly use \"Monetary Authority\" or \"Financial Services and Markets Authority,\" omitting \"Hong Kong\" or using an unrelated entity.  \n2. **Subgroup Terminology:** \"Subgroup\" (小組) is more precise than \"Subcommittee\" (subcommittee) or \"Group\" (group), as the original specifies a working group, not a formal committee.  \n3. **Title Capitalization:** \"Co-Chair\" (with capitalization) is preferable for formal titles, though \"co-chair\" is also acceptable.  \n4. **FATF Description:** \"Global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering\" is more concise and accurate than \"organization that sets global standards to combat money laundering.\"  \n5. **Clarity:** Including \"(HKMA)\" in the first sentence improves clarity for readers unfamiliar with the acronym.  \nThe best translation integrates these refinements, ensuring accuracy, conciseness, and adherence to formal terminology.\n\n# Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre\n\n# May 5th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission jointly initiated the Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance.\n\n# May 20\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre published its first applied financial research report titled \"Fintech Adoption and Innovation in the Hong Kong Banking Sector.\"\n\n# June 29\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the People's Bank of China and the Monetary Authority of Macao, issued a joint announcement announcing the launch of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" pilot program in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\n# August 3rd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Centre under the BIS Innovation Hub have launched the \"InnoChallenge – Trade Finance Digitisation.\"\n\n# August 19th\n\nThe Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority chaired the first session of the 25th Meeting of the Governors of the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) via video conference.

Key observations:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Cross-Agency Steering Group\" (translations 1, 5) and \"Inter-Agency Steering Group\" (translations 3, 4, 6) are both acceptable, but \"Cross-Agency\" aligns more directly with \"跨機構\" (cross-agency). \"Steering Group\" is preferable to \"Task Force\" or \"Oversight Group\" as \"督導\" (supervise\/guide) implies strategic direction.  \n2. **Consistency**: \"Strategic plan\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) is standard, while \"strategy plan\" (translations 4, 6) is less idiomatic.  \n3. **Fluency**: \"Outlining six areas to strengthen...\" (translations 2, 4, 5, 6) is more natural than \"proposing to strengthen... from six aspects\" (translations 1, 3). \"Key areas\" (translations 4, 5, 6) adds specificity.  \n4. **Tense**: \"Has released\" (translations 2, 5, 6) emphasizes recency, while \"released\" (others) is neutral.  \n**Improvements**: Use \"Cross-Agency Steering Group\" for precision, \"strategic plan\" for consistency, and \"outlining six key areas\" for clarity.

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFacing the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's economy contracted for the second consecutive year in 2020, recording its worst-ever decline in history. Consumer and tourism-related industries were particularly hard-hit, with their contraction exceeding that of the overall economy. Meanwhile, the labor market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. In response to the severe economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced the largest-ever relief measures to support the economy. The rollout of vaccines is expected to restore normal economic activity, with growth anticipated in 2021. However, the strength and pace of economic recovery will remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economy Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 6.1% in 2020, marking the second consecutive year of contraction and the worst annual decline on record (Table 1). The sharp decline in economic activity was primarily driven by a severe contraction in local demand (Figure 1). The outbreak of the pandemic and corresponding social distancing measures severely impacted local consumption. Deteriorating business conditions also led to a noticeable reduction in overall investment expenditure. Externally, although the pandemic disrupted supply chains and caused a global demand contraction, Hong Kong's total goods exports only slightly declined due to the rapid recovery of mainland China's production and economic activities. In contrast, lockdowns, border closures, and travel restrictions brought global tourism to a standstill, severely impacting service exports. Weak demand driven by local and re-export activities also led to a decline in goods imports and service inputs. As the decline in import volumes outpaced that of exports, net exports (trade surplus) supported local GDP (Figure 1). By industry, consumption and tourism-related sectors—such as retail, accommodation, and food services—were hit particularly hard, experiencing contractions worse than the overall economy, while the financial sector recorded moderate growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Local Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth\n\nThe junior translators' translations generally capture the core content but exhibit several recurring issues. Key weaknesses include:  \n1. **Numerical Error**: All translations incorrectly state the total relief amount as \"300 billion\" instead of the original \"3,000 billion\" (3 trillion) HKD. This is a critical factual inaccuracy.  \n2. **Fund Name Translation**: \"防疫抗疫基金\" is inconsistently translated as \"Pandemic Preparedness and Response Fund\" (1,3) or \"Anti-Epidemic Fund\" (4,5,6). \"Anti-Epidemic Fund\" aligns more closely with the original term.  \n3. **Terminology**: \"保就業\" is translated as \"Job Protection\" (2,6) or \"Job Retention\" (1,3,5). \"Job Retention\" is more standard in economic contexts.  \n4. **Fluency**: Some translations use awkward phrasing, such as \"releasing buffers to enhance banks' lending capacity\" (1,3,6) or \"financial liquidity pressures\" (4), which could be simplified.  \n**Improvements**:  \n- Correct the total relief amount to **3,000 billion HKD**.  \n- Use **\"Anti-Epidemic Fund\"** for \"防疫抗疫基金\".  \n- Standardize \"Job Retention\" for \"保就業\".  \n- Simplify phrasing for clarity (e.g., \"alleviate financial pressures\" instead of \"financial liquidity pressures\").  \n- Ensure consistent terminology and smoother sentence flow.  \n---\nThe government swiftly introduced the largest relief measures in history through the 2020–21 Fiscal Budget to address the pandemic, disbursing four rounds of subsidies totaling over HK$3,000 billion from the Anti-Epidemic Fund. These measures included a one-off cash payment of HK$10,000 to eligible residents, wage subsidies through the Job Retention program, and one-time grants, rent reductions, and fee waivers for industries severely impacted by the pandemic. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopted a three-pronged approach to support the banking sector, thereby underpinning the real economy. These measures included actively coordinating with the banking industry to alleviate financial pressures on businesses and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks’ lending capacity, and ensuring sufficient liquidity to support local economic activities.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures eased significantly in 2020. Excluding the impact of one-off government relief measures, the core inflation rate slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the 2009 global financial crisis. Price pressures on basic foodstuffs (particularly fresh pork) diminished noticeably; dining-out prices also declined in the second half of the year, thanks to substantial discounts offered by the catering industry, aside from home cooking. The growth of the consumer price index’s rental component softened following the decline in newly signed private residential rents (Figure 2). More broadly, local business cost pressures decreased due to slower nominal wage growth and softer commercial rental rates; meanwhile, import price inflation moderated amid a weak global economic environment.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market deteriorated rapidly in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate surged from 3.3% to 6.6% during the year, reaching a 16-year high (Figure 3), with unemployment rates exceeding 10% in hard-hit sectors such as retail, accommodation, and food services. The underemployment rate also climbed to 3.8% in August, the highest level since the SARS outbreak. Partly due to a cyclical response to the rapid economic deterioration, the labor force participation rate slightly declined. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies plummeted, reflecting further contraction in overall labor demand. Nominal wage and income growth continued to slow. The government introduced the \"Job Protection\" program, providing employers with time-limited financial support to retain employees, offering the labor market some degree of support.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions\n\n#StockMarket\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but contain notable inconsistencies and errors. Key issues include:  \n1. **Numerical Discrepancy**: Translators 2 and 3 incorrectly state \"HK$40 billion\" instead of the correct \"HK$400 billion\" (4,000億港元). This is a critical factual error.  \n2. **Terminology**: \"Secondary listings\" should be hyphenated as \"secondary listings\" (not \"second listings\") to reflect the financial term.  \n3. **Fluency**: Some translations use passive phrasing (e.g., \"showed slight recovery\") or redundant expressions (e.g., \"with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic\").  \n4. **Precision**: \"Fundraising\" should be clarified as \"fundraising from IPOs\" to avoid ambiguity.  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nWith the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Hang Seng Index plummeted to a three-year low in the first quarter. Following large-scale support measures introduced by central banks and governments worldwide, the stock market stabilized somewhat in the second and third quarters (Figure 4). Driven by breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccine development, the stock market regained some upward momentum toward the end of the year. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 points by year-end, recording a 3.4% annual decline. Benefiting from secondary listings of mainland Chinese companies in Hong Kong, Hong Kong’s total fundraising from IPOs in 2020 reached approximately HK$400 billion, ranking second globally in terms of fundraising.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\n\n#PropertyMarket\n\nSupported in part by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market remained largely stable in 2020 (Figure 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes showed little change compared to the previous year. However, declining household incomes tightened affordability for home purchases. Meanwhile, the non-residential property market weakened further, with property prices falling to varying degrees and transaction volumes hitting a trough. Office and retail property rents plummeted due to economic contraction and rising vacancy rates. Given the significant adjustments in the non-residential property market since 2019 and the expectation of continued downward pressure, along with other factors such as the economic outlook and external environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to the decline in market demand, the government also revoked the double stamp duty on non-residential property purchases—a demand management measure—in November.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe junior translators have produced generally accurate and fluent translations, but several areas warrant refinement. Key strengths include consistent use of terms like \"subject to numerous uncertainties\" and \"real GDP growth rate,\" which align with the original's formal tone. However, minor inconsistencies exist: \"full year\" vs. \"year-on-year\" (the latter is misleading), \"Mainland China economy\" vs. \"mainland Chinese economy\" (the latter is more precise), and \"success\" vs. \"effectiveness\" (the latter better reflects the original's \"成效\"). Additionally, \"early part of 2021\" is preferable to \"first half\" for \"2021年早段.\" The phrase \"real local GDP\" is redundant, as GDP inherently refers to local production. Finally, \"latest growth forecasts\" should replace \"growth forecast\" to match the original's \"最新的增長預測.\"\n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to restore normal economic activities, with Hong Kong’s economy projected to resume positive growth for the full year of 2021. However, the strength and pace of the economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic, vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness. Specifically, since widespread vaccination will take time, the local economy will continue to face significant challenges in the early part of 2021. Externally, the mainland Chinese economy is expected to strengthen further, providing support for Hong Kong’s exports of goods and services. However, the recovery pace of other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of their large-scale vaccination programs. The government forecasts that real GDP growth in 2021 will be between 3.5% and 5.5%, consistent with the average of 4.4% in the latest growth forecasts by international organizations and private sector analysts.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nGiven the continued challenges in global and local economic conditions, inflationary pressures are expected to remain mild in 2021. Furthermore, the pass-through effect of the recent decline in private residential rents will continue to suppress local inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.5% for 2021, while the government expects overall and core inflation rates to be 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Due to the challenging economic outlook in the early part of 2021, coupled with private sector analysts' expectations that the unemployment rate will remain at a relatively high level of around 5.9% for the entire year, the labor market is expected to remain under pressure in the short term.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2020, with banks maintaining sound financial conditions. Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, banks continued to expand their balance sheets, with deposits increasing. The banking system's capital and liquidity conditions remained ample, while asset quality slightly deteriorated but remained at a stable level.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 5.7% in 2020. Due to the economic slowdown, loan growth for the year slowed to 1.2%, down from a 6.7% increase in 2019; of which, loans used in Hong Kong rose by 2.2%, loans used outside Hong Kong increased marginally by 0.1%, while trade financing fell by 6.2%. Related loans in mainland China slightly declined by 0.2% in 2020, compared to a 7.4% growth in 2019.\n\nOn the liabilities side of the bank's balance sheet, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared to a 2.9% increase in 2019. Due to the faster growth of total deposits compared to total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking system's capital position remained robust in 2020, providing a strong buffer against potential shocks. The consolidated capital adequacy ratio of locally registered authorized institutions stood at 20.7% at the end of 2020, maintaining stability compared to the end of 2019. The Tier 1 capital ratio rose slightly from 18.5% to 18.7% during the same period (Figure 6).\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Basel III leverage ratio remained stable compared to the end of 2019, still at 8.2%, significantly exceeding the regulatory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in fluency and precision. Key observations:  \n1. **Structure**: Most translations place \"compared to the end of 2019\" after the year, which feels slightly awkward. A smoother flow is achieved by placing the comparison immediately after \"remained stable.\"  \n2. **Adverb Choice**: \"Far exceeding,\" \"significantly exceeding,\" and \"much higher\" all convey the intended emphasis, but \"significantly exceeding\" is more formal and precise in a regulatory context.  \n3. **Terminology**: \"Statutory\" vs. \"regulatory\" – while both are acceptable, \"regulatory\" is more commonly used in financial contexts when referring to Basel III requirements.  \n4. **Redundancy**: The sixth translation's \"holding steady at 8.2% compared to the end of 2019\" is redundant, as \"remained stable\" already implies consistency.  \nThe improved translation prioritizes clarity, formal precision, and natural phrasing while adhering to financial terminology conventions.\n\nFigure 6: Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered Recognized Institutions\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Status\n\nThe banking system's liquidity position remains robust, capable of withstanding liquidity shocks under stress scenarios. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Tier 1 institutions was 155.1% in the fourth quarter, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Tier 2 institutions was 57.9%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions\n\nThe banking system's funding sources have remained stable. As of the end of 2020, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions was 138.6%, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The core capital ratio for Category 2A institutions was 139.5%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: Funding Ratio of Designated Recognized Institutions\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nUnder the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the asset quality of the banking system slightly declined during the year, but remained sound by historical and international standards. The specific category loan ratio increased from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the overdue and restructured loan ratio rose from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Figure 10). For loans related to mainland China, the specific category loan ratio rose from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. Delinquency rates for residential mortgages and credit card loans remained low, at 0.04% and 0.27%, respectively (Figure 11).  \nThe translations generally capture the technical content accurately but vary in fluency and terminology. Key improvements include:  \n1. **Consistency in terminology**: \"Specific category loan ratio\" (used in translations 2-5) is more precise than \"specific classification loan ratio\" (translations 1, 3-6).  \n2. **Clarity of reference**: \"Loans related to mainland China\" (translation 4) avoids ambiguity better than \"related loans in mainland China\" (translations 1-3, 6).  \n3. **Conciseness**: \"Remained low\" (translations 1-3, 5) is preferable to \"remained at low levels\" (translations 4, 6).  \n4. **Sentence structure**: Grouping related data (e.g., mainland China loan ratios) into a single sentence improves readability (translation 4).  \n5. **Formality**: \"Sound\" (translations 2, 6) is more formal than \"good\" (translations 1, 3-5), aligning with financial reporting standards.  \nThe final translation integrates these refinements for precision, fluency, and adherence to financial terminology.  \nUnder the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the asset quality of the banking system slightly declined during the year, but remained sound by historical and international standards. The specific category loan ratio increased from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the overdue and restructured loan ratio rose from 0.34% to 0.57% during the same period (Figure 10). For loans related to mainland China, the specific category loan ratio rose from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. Delinquency rates for residential mortgages and credit card loans remained low, at 0.04% and 0.27%, respectively (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 10: Asset Quality of the Banking System\n\nFigure 11: Delinquency Rates for Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nThe low-interest environment combined with a slight decline in asset quality has put pressure on the banking system's profitability. The overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks decreased by 29.4% in 2020 (Figure 12), primarily due to a decrease in net interest income (-21.9%) and an increase in loan impairment provisions (+61.3%).

Supported by significant inflows of capital related to equities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side exchange rate intervention mechanism being triggered multiple times. The linked exchange rate system serves as the cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system, fully demonstrating its resilience against shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily employs a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; when the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must correspondingly increase or decrease, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises:  \n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins  \n- The aggregate balances of settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance)  \n- Foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology:** \"Certificates of indebtedness\" (used by Translators 1, 4, 5, 6) is more precise than \"Promissory Notes\" (Translator 2) or \"Certificates of Deposit\" (Translator 3).  \n2. **Institutional Names:** Translators 3 incorrectly refer to the \"Financial Services and Treasury Bureau\" instead of the \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\"—a critical error.  \n3. **Consistency:** \"Total balance\" (Translators 1, 4, 6) aligns with the original term 總結餘, while \"total reserves\" (Translators 2, 4) introduces a financial term not present in the source.  \n4. **Fluency:** Translator 5’s use of \"aggregate balances of clearing accounts\" is slightly more formal but accurate. \"Settlement accounts\" (used by most) is also acceptable.  \n5. **Structure:** Translator 5’s use of \"comprises\" is stylistically preferable to \"includes\" for formal definitions.  \nThe best translation integrates accurate terminology, correct institutional names, and consistent phrasing while maintaining clarity and fluency.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automated interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to honoring the exchange guarantee. When the strong (or weak) exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars) at a rate of HK$7.75 per U.S. dollar (or HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) the total reserves. This causes the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the 7.75 to 7.85 exchange band.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nWith the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus in March, risk-averse sentiment led global investors to increase their holdings of U.S. dollars, significantly tightening U.S. dollar liquidity. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong dollar interest rates are influenced by contemporaneous U.S. interest rates, so the tight U.S. dollar liquidity tightened Hong Kong’s monetary conditions. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve later implemented liquidity measures, easing dollar funding pressures, Hong Kong’s monetary conditions remained relatively tight due to stock-related demand and quarter-end settlement effects. Strong demand for Hong Kong dollars, combined with the positive interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, stimulated carry trade activities, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate toward the strong-side exchange rate guarantee (Figure 1). The strong-side exchange rate guarantee was ultimately triggered in April. Subsequently, robust initial public offering (IPO) fundraising activities, along with southbound capital inflows under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs, drove sustained inflows of stock-related capital, keeping the Hong Kong dollar near the 7.75 level and causing the strong-side exchange rate guarantee to be triggered multiple times throughout 2020. The strong-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times between April 21 and October 28, resulting in cumulative inflows of HK$383.5 billion. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2020.\n\nFigure 1: 2020 Market Exchange Rates\n\nThe total reserves (before discount window operations) and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds increased from HKD 11,330 billion at the end of 2019 to HKD 15,266 billion at the end of 2020 (Figure 2). Following the activation of the strong-side exchange rate guarantee, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) sold a total of HKD 383.5 billion at the request of banks. The global macroeconomic volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic prompted the HKMA to provide additional Hong Kong dollar liquidity by gradually reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund bills by a total of HKD 20 billion in late April and early May. As a result of the activation of the strong-side exchange rate guarantee and the reduction in the issuance of Exchange Fund bills, the total reserves (before discount window operations) increased from HKD 54.3 billion at the end of 2019 to HKD 4,575 billion at the end of 2020. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds decreased slightly from HKD 10,787 billion to HKD 10,692 billion during the year, reflecting the reduced issuance of Exchange Fund bills, which offset the usual practice of absorbing interest payments on outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds through new issuances. The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2020 Cumulative Surplus (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nFollowing the decline in liquidity demand after the Lunar New Year holiday, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally decreased in February (Figure 3). In March, HIBOR temporarily rose due to U.S. dollar funding pressures, alongside local factors such as fundraising related to new share offerings and end-of-quarter liquidity demands. Subsequently, the triggering of the strong-side convertibility guarantee and a reduction in the issuance of Exchange Fund notes led to an increase in aggregate balance, gradually easing the liquidity situation for the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, phrasing, and numerical formatting. Key observations:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Prime lending rates\" (used in most translations) is more standard than \"best lending rates\" (used in Translation 1). \"Discount window lending\" (Translations 2, 3, 5, 6) is preferable to \"discount window borrowing\" (Translation 1).  \n2. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"Federal Funds Target Range\" (Translations 4, 6) are redundant; \"Federal Funds Rate\" is sufficient.  \n3. **Numerical Formatting**: \"HKD 38.3 billion\" (Translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is correct, but \"383 billion Hong Kong dollars\" (Translations 2, 4) is unnecessarily verbose.  \n4. **Fluency**: \"Function normally\" (Translations 3, 4, 6) is slightly less idiomatic than \"operate normally\" (Translations 1, 2, 5).  \n**Improvements**: Use \"Federal Funds Rate\" consistently, adopt \"prime lending rates,\" standardize numerical formatting (e.g., \"HKD 38.3 billion\"), and ensure concise, idiomatic phrasing.  \n---\nThe basic interest rate decreased from 2.73% at the start of the year to 0.50% by year-end in response to two rate cuts in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range in March, as well as changes in overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) during the year. At the retail level, despite the reduction in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range, banks maintained their prime lending rates unchanged. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending fell from HKD 38.3 billion in 2019 to HKD 9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) in 2020\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor over three decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system, consistently demonstrating robust resilience through various challenges. Despite the difficulties encountered in 2020, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate normally, repeatedly proving the system’s stability and effectiveness. Throughout the year, in response to baseless rumors questioning the Linked Exchange Rate System and Hong Kong’s financial stability, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly reaffirmed to the public that Hong Kong would continue to implement the system, emphasizing that the free flow of capital and the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar are guaranteed by Article 112 of the Basic Law. The HKMA also published several articles clarifying that Hong Kong’s financial system continues to showcase strong resilience against shocks even in adverse conditions. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The orderly operation of Hong Kong’s financial markets, alongside the continued use of the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of payment and store of value, reflects the effectiveness of these measures in sustaining public confidence in the system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed in its “2020 External Sector Report” that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, all of which ensure the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA robust banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate system. Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong's banking system has continued to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, while maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending. At the same time, the HKMA has provided additional liquidity to the banking system to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition to reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund Bills to increase Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA has established a series of liquidity arrangements for banks. Furthermore, the HKMA maintains close communication with banks to ensure they can effectively utilize these liquidity arrangements during periods of stress. In response to the volatility and uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in global financial markets, the HKMA introduced temporary U.S. dollar liquidity arrangements to provide U.S. dollar liquidity support to licensed banks, helping to alleviate liquidity strains in the global U.S. dollar interbank market.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, a portion of its assets has been designated to support the monetary base since October 1998. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, without reaching the upper or lower limits. It closed at 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of its assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong’s sound banking system, provide strong backing for maintaining the territory’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Variation of Support Ratio in 2020\n\n# Other Matters\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues relating to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. In 2020, the issues examined by the Currency Issuance Committee included a scenario analysis of the Hong Kong economy, an assessment of the Hong Kong property market, understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border capital flows, and understanding the Hong Kong interbank market. The minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Issuance Department submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Currency Research\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, the Hong Kong Research Centre for Monetary and Financial Studies (the Centre) maintained a certain level of research output in 2020. In that year, the Centre published a total of 20 research papers covering a wide range of topics, including monetary policy, banking system stability, market microstructure, and fintech development. Some of these papers have been accepted or are currently under review for publication in professional journals. Due to the implementation of social distancing measures and travel restrictions during the pandemic, the Centre had to postpone its major activities, such as seminars, lectures, and research visits. These activities will be resumed once public health and travel conditions return to normal.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of circulating banknotes (issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 559.5 billion, representing an 8.3% increase compared to the previous year (Figures 5, 6, and 7). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government was HKD 12.7 billion, a 0.6% decrease from the previous year (Figures 8 and 9). Among the government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of HKD 10 circulating banknotes was HKD 4.6 billion, with polymer banknotes accounting for 79%.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core data accurately but vary in clarity, terminology, and consistency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology:** \"Note-issuing banks\" (used in translations 2, 4, 6) is more precise than \"banks\" or \"commercial banks\" (translations 1, 5), which risk ambiguity.  \n2. **Currency Format:** \"HKD\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is concise and standard in financial contexts, though \"Hong Kong dollars\" (translations 2, 4, 5) is also acceptable.  \n3. **Numerical Accuracy:** Translation 4 incorrectly states \"HKD 46 billion\" instead of \"HKD 4.6 billion,\" a critical error.  \n4. **Technical Terms:** \"Polymer banknotes\" (translations 2, 6) is more precise than \"plastic notes\" (translations 1, 3).  \n5. **Redundancy:** Translation 4 redundantly uses \"paper currency\" alongside \"banknotes,\" which is unnecessary.  \nThe best translation integrates precise terminology (\"note-issuing banks,\" \"polymer banknotes\"), consistent currency notation (\"HKD\"), and avoids numerical errors. It also maintains conciseness while preserving the original's formal tone.\n\nFigure 5: Amount of Circulating Banknotes by Issuing Banks as of the End of 2020\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Circulating Banknotes as of the End of 2020\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 8: Circulating Amount of Government-Issued Paper Money and Coins at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Banknotes and Coins as of the End of 2020\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nFollowing the introduction of new HK$20 and HK$50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 series banknotes are now in circulation. This series incorporates enhanced security features for greater durability and ease of use, and has been widely welcomed by the public, gradually replacing the older series.\n\nThe original text details the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) efforts to educate the public on Hong Kong banknotes through seminars, emphasizing their design and anti-counterfeiting features. The junior translations mostly capture the core information but exhibit inconsistencies in tense, terminology, and phrasing. Key issues include:  \n- **Tense errors**: Translations 3 and 5 incorrectly use \"will continue\" instead of \"continued\" (past tense).  \n- **Terminology**: \"Security features\" (Translation 6) is less precise than \"anti-counterfeiting features.\" \"Bank tellers\" (Translations 1, 4) is vague; \"bank counter staff\" or \"bank staff\" is more accurate.  \n- **Word choice**: \"Lectures\" vs. \"seminars\" – both are acceptable, but \"seminars\" better conveys interactive educational sessions.  \n- **Fluency**: \"Within the year\" (Translation 3) is awkward; \"Throughout the year\" (Translations 1, 4) is more natural.  \n- **Number formatting**: \"8\" should be written as \"eight\" in formal writing.  \nImprovements would involve:  \n1. Ensuring consistent past tense (\"continued\" instead of \"will continue\").  \n2. Using precise terms like \"anti-counterfeiting features\" and \"bank counter staff.\"  \n3. Choosing \"seminars\" for clarity and formality.  \n4. Writing numbers in full (\"eight\" instead of \"8\").  \n---\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to host seminars introducing the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKMA held eight seminars (including online sessions), enhancing public understanding of Hong Kong banknotes and attracting over 2,000 participants, including bank counter staff, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin Collection Program\n\nThe Coin Collection Scheme was launched in October 2014 and remained widely popular with the public throughout the year. It is the world’s first systematic mobile coin collection initiative, featuring two mobile coin collection vehicles that rotate through all 18 districts across Hong Kong. Each vehicle is equipped with two high-speed coin counters, allowing citizens to exchange coins for banknotes, top up stored-value payment tools such as Octopus cards or electronic wallets, or donate the funds to the Hong Kong Community Chest via donation boxes inside the vehicles. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) partnered with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the collection vehicles during NGO flag days to gather coins. The vehicles also visit schools to raise students’ awareness of the coin collection scheme. Over the years, the scheme has received numerous local and international awards, recognizing its innovative and environmentally friendly approach.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\nThe translations exhibit notable inconsistencies in grammatical structure and lexical choice. While all versions capture the core meaning, several critical issues emerge: (1) \"stable\" (adjective) is less appropriate than \"stability\" (noun) for formal contexts, as the original Chinese uses the adjective \"穩定\" in a nominalized context; (2) capitalization patterns are inconsistent, with some translations using title case (\"Banking System Stability\") and others using sentence case (\"banking system stable\"); (3) the hashtag (#) in translations 4 and 6 is redundant unless the original text's formatting is explicitly required. The most accurate translation should use the noun form \"stability\" with proper title case capitalization, avoiding unnecessary punctuation.\n\nDespite the significant challenges posed by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic to the economy, the banking system in Hong Kong remained sound in 2020. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely monitored the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and regulatory activities, responding flexibly while continuing to prioritize credit and liquidity risk management at authorized institutions. In light of the persistent rise in cyber threats and the increasing adoption of fintech in the banking sector, the HKMA enhanced its regulatory oversight of technology risk management and operational resilience at authorized institutions. The HKMA also closely collaborated with banks and international organizations to facilitate the industry's transition to alternative reference rates.\n\nIn terms of conduct supervision, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) provides recognized institutions with flexibility in complying with regulatory requirements and offers guidance to assist banks in maintaining business operations and continuing to serve customers during the pandemic, while simultaneously ensuring ongoing protection for investors and consumers. The HKMA, in collaboration with relevant authorities, has developed proposed implementation details for the pilot program of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" and has consulted with the industry. In partnership with the Securities and Futures Commission, the HKMA has provided guidance on streamlining sales procedures for family offices and sophisticated investors with high net worth and financial expertise. Furthermore, the HKMA has strengthened consumer protection in digital financial services and continues to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nThe six translations generally capture the core content of the original text but vary in accuracy, fluency, and terminology. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: Most translations use \"HKMA\" correctly, but Translation 6 erroneously refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" which is a critical error. \"RegTech\" (used in Translations 1, 2, 4) is more precise than \"compliance technology\" (Translations 3, 5) or \"regulatory technology\" (Translation 6).\n2. **Nuance and Precision**: The original emphasizes the HKMA's \"審慎應對\" (prudent response) to geopolitical tensions. Translations 1, 2, and 4 use \"prudently managing\" or \"cautiously addressing,\" which align well. Translation 3's \"carefully addressing\" is slightly less precise.\n3. **Structural Flow**: Translations 1, 2, and 4 maintain a balanced structure, clearly separating the HKMA's actions against pandemic-related risks and geopolitical tensions. Translation 6's use of \"financial institutions\" instead of \"authorized institutions\" (認可機構) is overly broad.\n4. **Cultural\/Contextual Appropriateness**: The term \"public-private information sharing initiatives\" (Translations 1, 2, 4) better reflects the original's \"公私營夥伴共享訊息\" than \"public-private partnerships for information sharing\" (Translations 3, 5).\n5. **Verbosity**: Translation 3's \"capabilities in monitoring\" is less precise than \"supervisory capabilities\" (Translations 1, 2, 4, 5). Translation 6's \"further plans\" is vague compared to the original's \"plan.\"\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has swiftly taken action to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help authorized institutions more effectively address situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while prudently addressing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continues to support measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts, including increasing the number of authorized institutions participating in public-private information-sharing initiatives and supporting the banking sector’s adoption of RegTech. In line with international trends in technology and data utilization, the HKMA has launched a plan to further strengthen its supervisory capabilities in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working closely with the banking sector to optimize regulatory policies and procedures, as well as implement measures to enhance the professional capabilities of personnel. Hong Kong has made significant progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. In promoting the development of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second phase of a three-phase approach and is currently formulating relevant regulatory guidelines. The HKMA also continues to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism for authorized institutions, including the development of new resolution standards and the implementation of rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements, to enhance the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the essential financial services required by Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even in extreme cases through disorderly closures. As the regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The HKMA also oversees the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) cannot guarantee that the financial system is entirely free of risk, and Hong Kong's prudent regulatory regime is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the HKMA strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its insolvency can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution framework, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (as well as other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong's resolution framework, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the HKMA's operational capability to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\n# 2020 Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a total of 186 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and fintech strategies. To continue enhancing the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the Authority held 30 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards, and conducted 30 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also conducts regular on-site inspections, complemented by thematic assessments, to examine areas deemed to be of higher risk. Throughout the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 610 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, continuing to focus on credit risk management as one of the main priorities in its reviews and assessments. Another key focus was operational and technology risk management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the HKMA increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity and market risk management. At the same time, specialized review teams conducted on-site inspections and thematic assessments of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintained its regulatory rigor and implemented flexible arrangements to effectively and adaptably fulfill its regulatory responsibilities. This included providing flexibility in the submission of reports and conducting on-site inspections, enhancing data collection to complement on-site inspections, and utilizing online conferencing platforms.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory activities in 2020.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe original text discusses loan growth percentages and references a table. The junior translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology and phrasing. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology**: \"貸款總額\" is translated as \"total loan amount\" (translations 1, 6) or \"loan volume\" (translations 2, 3). \"Loan volume\" is more standard in financial contexts, as it refers to the aggregate amount of loans issued, whereas \"total loan amount\" is less precise.\n2. **Comparative phrasing**: The phrase \"compared to an increase of 6.7% in 2019\" (translations 1, 3, 6) is grammatically correct but slightly wordy. \"Compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019\" (translations 4, 5) is more concise and natural in English.\n3. **Verb choice**: \"Shows\" (translations 1, 4, 5, 6) and \"details\" (translations 2, 3) are both acceptable, but \"shows\" is more neutral and widely used in formal reporting. \"Details\" implies specificity that may not be warranted unless the table provides granular data.\n4. **Redundancy**: \"Various types of loans and advances\" (translations 1–3, 6) is slightly redundant. \"Various loans and advances\" suffices, as \"types\" is implied by the table's categorization.\n**Improved translation**:  \nLoan volume increased by 1.2% in 2020, compared to a 6.7% increase in 2019. Table 2 shows the growth of various loans and advances.  \nThis version uses \"loan volume\" for precision, adopts the concise comparative phrasing, and avoids redundancy while maintaining clarity and formality.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nIn 2020, the total amount of related loans in mainland China slightly decreased by 0.2% to HK$4.553 trillion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n\nThe asset quality of accredited institutions has slightly deteriorated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific classified loan ratio in the banking sector rose from 0.57% to 0.90% during the year, remaining at a sound level and far below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. Regarding mainland-related loans, the relevant ratio also increased from 0.75% compared to the previous year to 0.96%.\n\nGiven the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic posing significant challenges to the economy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has conducted a thorough review of the asset quality of authorized institutions to assess trends of deteriorating asset quality. In particular, the HKMA has enhanced its monitoring of large borrowers and sectors more vulnerable to the current economic environment by collecting data on credit risk exposures at both the industry and borrower levels. The special stress testing analysis conducted by the HKMA indicates that banks have the capacity to withstand the economic pressures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic assessment to review the credit risk management practices of authorized institutions across various areas, including loans related to mainland China, interbank loans, and secured loans to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\n# Measures to Alleviate Customers' Cash Flow Pressures\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in October 2019. This mechanism introduced multiple rounds of relief measures to assist both corporate and individual customers, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers’ financing needs under the principles of prudent risk management. The most significant initiative was the “Pre-approved Interest-only Repayment Plan” launched by the Coordination Mechanism in May, which allowed eligible corporate customers to defer all principal repayments for six months. The plan was extended by six months in November and again in March 2021, ending on October 31. Approximately 100 banks participated in the plan, covering around 120,000 eligible corporate customers. As of the end of December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of loan deferrals and other support measures for corporate customers, involving a total amount exceeding HK$740 billion.  \nFor individual customers, banks also introduced a residential mortgage “interest-only repayment” plan, which included mortgages for properties under the “Home Ownership Scheme.” In addition, banks provided emergency loans to customers in industries severely affected by the pandemic, extended personal loan terms, and reduced fees for various personal credit products. As of the end of December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of residential mortgage “interest-only repayment” and other personal emergency loans, involving a total amount exceeding HK$44 billion.  \n---  \n**Final Translation:**  \nIn response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in October 2019.

As of the end of December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of residential mortgage “interest-only repayment” and other personal emergency loans, involving a total amount exceeding HK$44 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have enhanced banks' risk management capabilities and strengthened the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system to withstand a sudden downturn in the local property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2020, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average LTV ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans increased in 2020, primarily due to a higher proportion of loans involving mortgage insurance, which typically carry higher LTV ratios. The average debt service-to-income (DSI) ratio for newly approved mortgages also remained at a low level, standing at 37% in December, compared to 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nConsidering the original text's focus on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory adjustment, the translations generally capture the key elements but vary in fluency, terminology, and clarity. The first, second, and sixth translations are the most accurate, with the sixth offering the clearest structure by explicitly naming the HKMA and using \"loan-to-value (LTV) ratio ceiling\" for precision. However, all translations could benefit from tighter phrasing, consistent terminology (e.g., \"relaxed\" vs. \"eased\"), and smoother integration of the percentage increase. The phrase \"general cases\" is vague and could be replaced with \"typical cases\" or \"standard cases\" for clarity. Additionally, \"economic fundamentals\" is more precise than \"economic conditions\" or \"economic outlook.\" The best translation would balance conciseness, technical accuracy, and natural English flow.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) relaxed its countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential property mortgage loans in August, taking into account factors such as price trends, transaction volumes, economic fundamentals, and external conditions. The applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio ceiling for such loans was increased by 10 percentage points, raising the standard case limit from 40% to 50%.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Regulation of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in early 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) implemented a series of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. These measures included requiring authorized institutions to review their business continuity plans and take appropriate preventive measures to ensure the health and safety of employees and customers, as well as to maintain essential banking services. Additionally, the HKMA reminded authorized institutions to enhance communication with employees and customers, prepare for the possibility of confirmed cases within their premises, and develop business continuity plans to address more severe yet potentially occurring risk scenarios. The HKMA maintained close contact with the industry and required authorized institutions to remain vigilant, regularly reviewing their business continuity plans in light of the latest developments in the pandemic and the government’s social distancing measures.\n\nThe original text outlines the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) enhancement of its \"Cyber Defence Plan\" through a revised framework, expanded training qualifications, and improved information-sharing mechanisms. The junior translations vary in terminology consistency, accuracy, and fluency. Key issues include inconsistent use of terms like \"Cyber Defence Plan\" vs. \"Cybersecurity Protection Plan,\" mislabeling the framework as \"Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework\" (instead of \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework\"), and redundant phrasing like \"overseas cyber risk management\" (which conflates \"international\" and \"overseas\"). Some translations also use less precise terms (e.g., \"preparedness\" instead of \"defence\") or obscure acronyms (e.g., HKAB instead of HKMA). The best translation should maintain consistent terminology, avoid redundancy, and ensure clarity in institutional names and program titles.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nFollowing a comprehensive review and extensive industry consultation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0\" in November, further enhancing the original plan in line with the latest international practices in cyber risk management. The \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework\" within the plan now incorporates the latest internationally recognized robust practices regarding cyber incident response and recovery. Under the \"Professional Training Programme\" of the \"Cyber Defence Plan,\" the scope of the qualification accreditation list has been expanded to include equivalent qualifications from major overseas jurisdictions. The HKMA also proposed several recommendations to the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association) to improve the usability of the \"Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform.\" The \"Cyber Defence Plan 2.0\" took effect on January 1, 2021.\n\n# Smart Bank\n\nAfter undergoing rigorous testing and trials within the \"FinTech Regulatory Sandbox,\" all eight virtual banks granted banking licenses in 2019 have launched operations this year. These institutions leverage innovative technology to deliver enhanced customer experiences, such as utilizing big data analytics for credit assessments of SME loans, thereby accelerating the loan approval process. To boost customer engagement and foster brand loyalty, some virtual banks have integrated gamification elements into their services, including fixed deposit accounts and reward programs.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn April, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced a series of measures to ensure the continued smooth operation of the interbank market and banking system during the pandemic. These measures included clarifying the operational details of the \"HKMA Liquidity Arrangement,\" introducing a temporary US dollar liquidity arrangement, and reaffirming the flexibility for recognized institutions to utilize liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted exercises with recognized institutions to ensure they were prepared to implement these measures when necessary.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial center. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority implemented multiple measures to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (TransferFast) surged sharply.  \nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial center. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority implemented multiple measures to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction volume of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (TransferFast) surged sharply.\n\nHong Kong, strategically positioned at the frontline of mainland China's financial market opening, is well-placed to fully capitalize on the opportunities arising from this process. With world-class market infrastructure and initiatives such as the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and Bond Connect, Hong Kong serves not only as a highly favored fundraising platform for mainland Chinese enterprises but also as a gateway for international investors to access the rapidly growing mainland market. This year has seen significant progress in promoting financial cooperation within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, particularly in facilitating Hong Kong residents' access to financial and banking services within the region.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively exploring new opportunities to enhance Hong Kong's financial infrastructure, including strengthening the competitiveness of asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and sustainable finance. The HKMA is also intensifying its market outreach efforts to promote Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. On a global scale, the HKMA assumes leadership roles in multiple regional and international committees, fully demonstrating Hong Kong's professional expertise and commitment in relevant international initiatives.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as an Asia-Pacific financial technology hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology in the banking and payment sectors. Key developments this year include:  \n- Promoting wider adoption of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System);  \n- Encouraging the banking sector to implement open application programming interfaces (open APIs);  \n- Connecting the trade finance platform \"TradeLink\" with the trade finance blockchain platform under the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to advance the digitization of trade finance;  \n- Researching the application of central bank digital currency (CBDC) in cross-border payments;  \n- Exploring the technical feasibility of \"Commercial Data Exchange\" and researching new types of credit scoring models to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access financing;  \n- Announcing a two-year plan aimed at developing a more scalable and diverse RegTech ecosystem, further promoting the application of RegTech;  \n- Strengthening talent development; and  \n- Advancing cross-border fintech cooperation.\n\nThe Financial Technology Promotion Office (FFO) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with its various banking departments, plays a key role in promoting the aforementioned measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices begin to include mainland onshore securities or increase their weightings, the inflow of funds into RMB-denominated assets continues to accelerate. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to play a key role in facilitating increased allocation of RMB assets by international investors, thanks to its connectivity with mainland capital markets through the \"Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect,\" and \"Bond Connect.\" In 2020, the average daily turnover of \"Bond Connect\" increased by 82%, reaching approximately RMB 19.3 billion. To refine the operation of \"Bond Connect,\" the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced new measures, including the establishment of a special settlement cycle service, extended trading hours, and new arrangements to provide investors with greater flexibility in selecting banks for currency exchange and foreign exchange hedging. Following the success of the northbound component of \"Bond Connect,\" the HKMA has formed a working group with the People's Bank of China to study the framework for the southbound component.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strengthen financial arrangements between Hong Kong and mainland cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Mainland authorities have introduced a series of policy measures to support financial development in the region. In June, the People's Bank of China, the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority of Macao jointly announced the implementation of the cross-border \"Wealth Management Connect\" initiative. The HKMA has been closely collaborating with mainland and local authorities, as well as industry stakeholders, to formulate detailed implementation guidelines. It has also maintained communication with mainland authorities regarding other measures, seeking to expand policy space for Hong Kong banks to broaden their cross-border business scope. Throughout the year, Hong Kong has maintained its position as the global offshore RMB business hub, with the average daily transaction volume of its RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reaching a new high of RMB 120 billion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is proactively seeking new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s fund industry, the HKMA collaborates closely with the government and industry stakeholders to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment for funds to establish operations locally. The HKMA is also dedicating significant efforts to further strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a leading regional hub for green and sustainable finance. Concurrently, the HKMA is intensifying its marketing efforts to showcase Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders both overseas and in mainland China.\n\nIn the field of central banking, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. For example, the HKMA chairs the Policy and Standards Subgroup under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and leads the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP). It also serves as co-chair of the Non-Bank Supervision Expert Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and leads a working group examining regulatory issues related to benchmark transitions.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for its status as an international financial center. In 2020, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU system), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Repository) achieved 100% system availability, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities depositories in mainland China, the CMU system continues to facilitate the settlement of northbound \"Bond Connect\" transactions and holds mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU system members.\n\nThe usage of Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to grow in 2020. By the end of 2020, a total of 6.9 million accounts had been registered, with the annual transaction volume tripling compared to 2019. The government's acceptance of FPS for fee payments and the increasing adoption by merchants were the primary drivers of the significant growth in transaction value, beyond the steady increase in person-to-person payments.\n\nTo ensure the overall safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designates and supervises six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"). The HKMA also continues to regulate 18 licensed stored value facility operators.\n\n# 2020 Year in Review\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as Asia's FinTech Hub\n\n# Fast RPM\n\nSince its launch in September 2018, the Faster Payment System (FPS) has attracted participation from 35 banks and 12 e-money operators, with five additional banks and one more e-money operator joining in 2020. FPS usage has also steadily increased. As of December 31, FPS had recorded a total of 6.9 million registered users (Figure 1). To facilitate citizens in receiving payments from institutions, FPS introduced the option to use Hong Kong Identity Card numbers as account identifiers starting December 6. Within less than a month after this feature was introduced, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This new function is not intended for person-to-person transfers, but rather for institutions to make payments to individuals whose ID numbers are already on file (e.g., salary disbursements). Since each citizen’s Identity Card number is unique, using Hong Kong Identity Card numbers as account identifiers ensures accurate receipt of payments even without providing bank account numbers.\n\nFigure 1: Number of Registrations for Quick Transfer Accounts\n\nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in accuracy, terminology, and fluency. Key issues include inconsistent naming of \"轉數快\" (FPS), numerical errors, and redundancy. The term \"Quick Pay\" is a mistranslation; the official name is \"Faster Payment System (FPS).\" The fourth translation incorrectly states \"RMB 950 million\" instead of \"RMB 95 million\" and misrepresents the 2018 figure as \"50,000 transactions\" (the original does not specify this number). The fifth and sixth translations use \"FPS\" correctly but retain \"Quick Pay\" in the sixth. Fluency is strongest in the fifth translation, which avoids redundancy and uses concise phrasing like \"spurred the adoption\" and \"gradually expanded.\" The fourth translation's structure is awkward, with unnecessary repetition (\"the increased usage of FPS has also benefited from...\"). The best approach is to use the official name \"FPS,\" correct numerical details, and streamline sentence structure for clarity and natural flow.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures have spurred the adoption of electronic payment services. The Faster Payment System (FPS) experienced particularly rapid growth this year (Figure 2), with an average of 505,000 real-time transactions per day in December 2020—amounting to HK$5.2 billion and RMB 95 million. This represents three times the 168,000 transactions recorded in December 2019 and tenfold the volume of the first month after FPS's launch in October 2018. The surge in FPS usage also reflects its expanding application scope, evolving from an initial focus on person-to-person payments to encompass bill payments (including government bills), retail, and commercial transactions.\n\nFigure 2: Average Daily Transaction Figures for Hong Kong Dollar Real-Time Payments\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been collaborating with multiple government departments and the banking sector to expand the application of the Faster Payment System (FPS) from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant transactions. Since November 2019, the government has accepted FPS for bill payments to promote its use and provide convenience to the public. Citizens can easily pay taxes, property rates, land rent, water bills, and general government fee notices by scanning the QR codes printed on bills using mobile banking apps or e-wallets that support FPS. As of December 2020, there were 1.8 million FPS transactions for government bill payments, totaling HK$2.2 billion. Following the successful launch of the government bill payment service, four additional government departments began accepting FPS QR code payments at designated payment counters and self-service kiosks from December 21, 2020. The government is also exploring plans to adopt FPS for online payments.\n\nAnother positive development is the increasing adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS) by businesses of all sizes to enhance their operational efficiency. Merchant transactions via FPS surged to an average of 100,000 per day in December 2020, a 38-fold increase compared to December 2019. FPS is widely used for bill payments, in-app direct debits, and other online purchases. The growing popularity of e-wallets has also driven a significant increase in transactions involving FPS for account top-ups. In December 2020, the average daily volume of top-up transactions was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo enhance public awareness of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has produced a range of educational and promotional materials, including television advertisements and a series of tips on smart FPS usage shared via social media platforms. The HKMA also organized a WhatsApp Sticker design competition for secondary school students to deepen their understanding of electronic payments. Furthermore, the HKMA has actively promoted FPS adoption among multiple charitable organizations and market operators. Numerous banks and stored-value payment tool operators participating in FPS have launched promotional campaigns, offering incentives to encourage customers to register and utilize FPS for fund transfers and bill payments. Building on the success of 2020, the HKMA partnered with banks and stored-value payment tool operators in early 2021 to promote the electronic distribution of red envelopes via FPS. While the HKMA launched targeted promotional activities, banks and stored-value payment tool operators provided additional incentives to encourage customers to send red envelopes electronically—a practice that is both environmentally friendly and supports pandemic prevention efforts.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to promote the development and provision of open APIs by the banking sector in accordance with the Open API Framework. The framework is implemented in four phases, with banks having already launched open APIs for the first and second phases. These APIs are being used to collaborate with third-party service providers, enabling the development of innovative services and enhancing customer experience. Meanwhile, the HKMA is conducting research and investigations into the implementation of open APIs for the third and fourth phases, and published a booklet in November detailing the findings of the research.\n\n# Trade Linkage\n\nTo provide importers and exporters with more convenient trade financing services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a proof-of-concept study this year to explore connecting \"TradeLink\" with the trade finance blockchain platform under the People's Bank of China. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of the year, followed by trials. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese banks have since successfully completed multiple cross-border trade financing transactions using this connection.\n\n#Cross-border payments\n\nRegarding central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank of Thailand continue joint research to explore CBDC applications in cross-border payments, aiming to promote simultaneous settlement of Hong Kong dollar and Thai baht foreign exchange transactions between banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. Both parties have completed the first phase of research and published a joint report in January outlining key findings; they have also developed a blockchain-based cross-border corridor network prototype to enhance cross-border payment efficiency and reduce costs. The second phase of the project has commenced, focusing on exploring commercial use cases for cross-border trade settlements and capital market transactions. Other central banks have shown strong interest in the initiative. In early 2021, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Digital Currency Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China announced their participation in the project.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2020 was a year of twists and turns, as the novel coronavirus pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to the global economy. After experiencing a sharp correction and volatility in asset markets during the first quarter, they rebounded rapidly, driven by ultra-loose monetary policies implemented by major central banks and large-scale fiscal stimulus measures enacted by governments worldwide. Significant cuts to benchmark interest rates by major central banks, coupled with the resumption of quantitative easing, led to a marked decline in government bond yields and a rise in bond prices. In this investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, representing an investment return of 5.3%.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and to be used for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the delegated powers and the terms of such delegation granted by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:  \n(a) To preserve capital;  \n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;  \n(c) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is maintained to support monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) To seek to maximize investment returns, subject to compliance with the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the Exchange Fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full backing for the monetary base in accordance with the provisions of the currency issuance regime. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of OECD member countries, aiming to preserve the value of assets and maintain their long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually allocated a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is capped at one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus, plus the portion of future fund deposits and deposits of the Exchange Fund’s subsidiaries that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund's account. Due to the portfolio's unique nature, it is not included in the investment performance evaluation of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a primary example of such deposits. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is tied to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate determined by the weighting of these portfolios. The Future Fund’s allocation is approximately 40% to the investment portfolio and 60% to the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is expressed as an investment benchmark, representing the long-term asset mix the Exchange Fund may adopt to achieve its investment objectives. Guided by this strategic allocation, the Exchange Fund employs tactical asset allocation to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Consequently, actual allocations often deviate from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between actual and benchmark allocations is termed \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, establishes the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and define the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within this permissible range to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for investment and related risk management functions. The office’s staff directly manage approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion of the portfolio comprises various global fixed-income market investments and executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy through derivative instruments.  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for investment and related risk management functions.

This portion of the portfolio comprises various global fixed-income market investments and executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market, enabling the Exchange Fund to achieve sustainable returns while benefiting from diversified and complementary investment strategies, as well as gaining insights and specialized investment knowledge from the market.\n\nThe expenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary from year to year, primarily due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\nThe translations provided by junior translators are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies. All versions correctly translate \"風險管理\" as \"Risk Management,\" which is standard. The key divergence lies in the translation of \"監察,\" with most using \"Supervision\" (translators 1, 3, 5) and two using \"Oversight\" (translators 4, 6). \"Oversight\" is slightly more precise in formal contexts, as it implies proactive monitoring and accountability, aligning better with modern risk management frameworks. However, \"Supervision\" is also acceptable and more commonly used in general business contexts. The inclusion of the \"#\" symbol in translations 2 and 6 is unnecessary unless the original text explicitly requires it as a heading marker. A polished translation should omit this unless context demands it. The optimal choice balances precision with common usage, favoring \"Oversight\" for its nuanced connotation in risk governance.\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making the importance of risk management self-evident. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has implemented a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. HKMA employs a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and oversight. It also regularly monitors major categories of investment risk (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks), and has enhanced its risk management procedures to align with the diversified investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports responsible investment by incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management processes of the Exchange Fund's public and private market investments.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a set of principles to assess the ESG risks and opportunities associated with the Exchange Fund's investment projects. Regarding portfolios managed by external investment managers, the HKMA implements responsible investment through these managers. Throughout the selection, appointment, and monitoring of external investment managers, the HKMA evaluates their implementation of various ESG aspects, including organizational structures for ESG governance, ESG standards and policies, the integration of ESG factors into investment processes, and stewardship activities such as proxy voting and engagement with portfolio companies (e.g., discussing ESG matters with the management of portfolio companies). To demonstrate its commitment to responsible investment, the HKMA promotes more comprehensive ESG practices through the stewardship role played by external investment managers. External investment managers responsible for managing the HKMA’s Hong Kong equity portfolio and the actively managed mainland China equity portfolio must commit to adhering to the Securities and Futures Commission’s \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" and provide explanations for any non-compliance. External investment managers responsible for managing developed market equity portfolios are required to adhere to internationally recognized ESG standards. In addition, the HKMA has launched a post-appointment monitoring program to review the implementation of proxy voting and engagement with portfolio companies by external investment managers.\n\nThe original text discusses the integration of ESG factors into credit risk analysis for bond investments by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The junior translations vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n- **Institutional name**: Some translations use \"Financial Services and Markets Authority\" (incorrect) or \"Monetary Authority\" (vague). The full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" is most precise.  \n- **Terminology**: \"Debt investment portfolios\" is less standard than \"fixed-income portfolios\" in financial contexts.  \n- **Verb choice**: \"Incorporate\" and \"integrate\" are both acceptable, but \"integrate\" better reflects the active inclusion of ESG factors.  \n- **Fluency**: Phrases like \"the relevant analysis is strengthened\" are awkward; \"further strengthened\" or \"strengthening the analysis\" flow better.  \n- **Redundancy**: \"Internal staff at the HKMA\" is redundant; \"internal staff of the HKMA\" is more concise.  \n**Improved translation**:  \nFixed-income portfolios managed by internal staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also integrate ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. By expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, the analysis is further strengthened.  \nFixed-income portfolios managed by internal staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also integrate ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. By expanding ESG data sources and increasing the weight of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, the analysis is further strengthened.\n\nRegarding ESG investments in the public market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has invested in green, social responsibility, and sustainable bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015, making it one of the early investors in this market. In addition, the HKMA participates in the International Finance Corporation’s “Joint Loan Portfolio Management Program,” with its investments focused on sustainable development projects in emerging markets. In 2020, coinciding with an increase in market supply, the HKMA expanded its investment in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to grow its ESG bond portfolio through direct investments or by holding ESG bond funds. Furthermore, it will encourage external investment managers to develop ESG-themed equity investment strategies by adopting ESG stock indices as benchmarks for passive investment portfolios. In the coming years, the HKMA will continue to monitor ESG-themed investment opportunities, such as active ESG investment portfolios and low-carbon-focused investment tools.\n\nIn the area of private market investments, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reviews the ESG policies and specific measures of designated partners during the due diligence process. The HKMA’s long-term growth portfolio actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, and its real estate portfolio also incorporates warehouses and other buildings with green and sustainable features. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to seek out projects with sustainable characteristics and will include green certification as a key consideration in real estate investments. The HKMA holds annual ESG workshops with designated partners to exchange views and experiences on sound ESG practices. During the ESG workshop held in November, designated partners discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their portfolio companies and the development of ESG investments. To enhance ESG transparency in private market investments, the HKMA has required designated partners to provide ESG-related information about their investment projects, such as climate change risks, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how to further integrate them into its investment processes, including collaborating with like-minded investors and international organizations. As a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the HKMA bears the responsibility of being a global advocate and will participate in developing ESG best practices, encouraging other investors to adopt responsible investment approaches. The HKMA is also a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to encourage long-term business and investment decisions through workshops and research. It has also participated in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and is a member of the Central Bank and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). In addition, the HKMA organizes seminars and actively participates in events hosted by the investment industry to share and promote the concept of ESG investing.\n\nFor details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's responsible investment policy framework, please refer to the \"Institutional Social Responsibility\" chapter.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# 2020 Financial Markets\n\nGlobal financial markets surged to record highs by year-end under the support of loose monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the major challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. After experiencing significant corrections and volatility in the first quarter, global equity markets quickly rebounded, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The U.S. S&P 500 index rose 16%, making it the best-performing stock index among the G7 countries in 2020.\n\nIn the bond market, yields on government bonds in major developed countries continued to face downward pressure following a significant decline in the first quarter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell by approximately 100 basis points, from 1.9% at the start of the year to 0.9% by year-end. Due to a sharp rise in major government bond prices, 2020 saw substantial capital gains in the bond market.\n\nIn the currency market, declining U.S. interest rates narrowed the interest rate differential, prompting the U.S. dollar to weaken against major currencies.

Internally, the HKMA is also committed to strengthening institutional governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, strengthening information technology security, and fostering a culture of innovation to address the challenges posed by the implementation of new projects and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n# Stay Connected with the Public\nThe original text \"# 與公眾保持聯繫\" is a heading emphasizing ongoing communication with the public. The junior translations all capture the core meaning but vary in formality, structure, and adherence to English conventions. Key observations:\n1. **Hashtag Consistency**: The original includes a hashtag (#), which should be preserved in the translation to maintain formatting and context. Translations 2, 5, and 6 correctly include it, while 1, 3, and 4 omit it, reducing alignment with the source.\n2. **Verb Choice**: \"Stay connected\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 5) is natural and commonly used in English for ongoing communication. \"Maintain contact\" (translation 6) is slightly more formal and less idiomatic. \"Stay in touch\" (translation 4) is conversational but less precise for institutional or professional contexts.\n3. **Capitalization**: The original uses uppercase for the heading, which should be mirrored in English for consistency. Translations 1, 2, 5, and 6 follow this, while 3 and 4 use lowercase, which may appear less polished in a formal context.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: All translations are culturally neutral, but \"Stay Connected with the Public\" is the most direct and widely applicable phrasing for headings in English, avoiding overly formal or informal tones.\n**Improved Translation**:  \n# Stay Connected with the Public  \nThis version preserves the hashtag, uses standard capitalization, and selects the most idiomatic and context-appropriate verb phrase.\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance transparency and foster public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2020, the HKMA organized a total of 93 in-person and online events, including 8 press conferences, 5 on-site interviews, and 80 other public activities. It also arranged 14 media interviews, issued 552 bilingual press releases, and handled a large number of media inquiries on a daily basis.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) key functions, the HKMA hosts press briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, as well as key opinion leaders, covering topics such as the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, green finance, and macroprudential regulatory measures.  \nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) key functions, the HKMA hosts press briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, as well as key opinion leaders, covering topics such as the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, green finance, and macroprudential regulatory measures.\n\nMr. Eddie Yue Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020.\nMr. Eddie Yue Wai-man, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, hosted an online panel discussion at Hong Kong FinTech Week 2020.\n\nMr. Ruan Guohang, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (center), chaired a media briefing to introduce the HKMA's two-year plan to promote the adoption of RegTech.\n\nMr. Zhou Wenzheng, Director of Financial Technology at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), was interviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong (HKMA) enhances public understanding of its work and strengthens communication with the public through social media. It currently operates five social media pages, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube. As of December 31, 2020, over 66,500 users followed the HKMA’s social media pages. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA effectively utilized social media to maintain communication with the public and dispel false rumors related to the stability of the financial and banking system.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service serves as an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) key functions and operations. In 2020, the service handled a total of 9,514 inquiries, with approximately half relating to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, banknotes and coins, financial infrastructure, and bond market development. These included topics such as the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, guidelines and notices related to the banking sector, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, as well as currency and economic data.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received annually since 2017, while Figure 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Total Public Inquiries\n\nFigure 2: Inquiries Received in 2020, Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the *Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability* and four issues of the *Quarterly Report* during the year. It also regularly updated the *Monthly Financial Statistics* to provide the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong’s monetary affairs, banking sector, and economic matters. Furthermore, the HKMA published 18 articles in the *Insights* series, introducing its key measures and policies and discussing issues of public concern.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2019 Annual Report won the Silver Award in the “Non-profit and Charitable Organizations” category of the Hong Kong Institute of Management’s 2020 Best Annual Report Awards.  \nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Organization Name**: Translators 2, 4, and 6 incorrectly use “Hong Kong Management Association” instead of the correct “Hong Kong Institute of Management” (香港管理專業協會).  \n2. **Event Terminology**: Some use “Selection” (e.g., Translators 3, 4, 6) instead of “Awards,” which is less standard for such events.  \n3. **Redundancy**: Translators 3 and 5 redundantly use “Annual Best Annual Report” (e.g., “Annual Best Annual Report Selection”).  \n4. **Spelling**: Variations in “Organizations” vs. “Organisations” (British vs. American English) are minor but should be consistent.  \nThe best translation balances accuracy, fluency, and adherence to the original’s structure. It uses the correct organization name, standard terminology (“Awards”), and avoids redundancy.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 40,000 pages of information in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest updates from the Authority. The website also features the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Operators of Stored Value Payment Instruments,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Instruments Ordinance.\n\nThe original text discusses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) phased release of financial data and information via open APIs since 2018, culminating in 144 APIs launched by 2020. The junior translations generally capture the core meaning but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, redundancy, and precision. Key observations:  \n- **Terminology**: Most translations use \"open application programming interfaces (open APIs)\" redundantly. \"Open APIs\" suffices after the first mention.  \n- **Verb Choice**: \"Progressively releasing\" (translations 3–5) aligns better with \"分階段發放\" (phased release) than \"gradually releasing\" (translations 1–2).  \n- **Prepositional Accuracy**: \"Hosted on its website\" (translation 1) is more precise than \"posted\" or \"published\" (translations 4–6).  \n- **Institutional Name**: Translation 6 incorrectly uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of \"HKMA,\" a critical error.  \n- **Formality**: \"As scheduled\" (translations 1–4) is more formal and appropriate for a government agency's planned activities than \"on schedule\" (translation 5).  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nSince 2018, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively released financial data and important information hosted on its website through open application programming interfaces (APIs). By the end of 2020, the HKMA had launched a total of 144 open APIs on its website as scheduled.\n\nThe original text refers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which is the official name of the institution. While all translations correctly convey the core meaning, several issues arise:\n1. **Institutional Name Accuracy**: \n   - \"Financial Supervisory Authority\" (Translation 1) and \"Financial Authority\" (Translation 5) are incorrect or overly generic. \n   - \"HKMA\" (Translations 2-4) is acceptable but lacks the full official name. \n   - \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" (Translations 3-4) is the most accurate and complete.\n2. **Terminology Precision**: \n   - \"Development and application\" (Translations 1-5) is grammatically correct but slightly ambiguous. \"Application\" could imply practical use, but \"adoption\" (Translation 6) better captures the proactive implementation of APIs, which aligns with the context of institutional support.\n3. **Redundancy**: \n   - Translations 3 and 4 are identical, suggesting a lack of originality in some submissions.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively supports the development and adoption of open APIs.  \nThis version uses the full official name, replaces \"application\" with the more precise \"adoption,\" and maintains conciseness.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2. It introduces the HKMA's work to the public and enhances the public's understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre comprises two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall uses interactive displays to present the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sectors. It also provides resources and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. Adjacent to the exhibition hall, the library houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on topics including Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions,\" as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre stood out among over a thousand participants from around the world, winning one of the Platinum Awards in the Interior Design category of the \"2020 MUSE DESIGN AWARDS\" for its meticulously designed and distinctive atmosphere.\n\nThe Information Centre took advantage of the temporary closure in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic to upgrade the facilities in the \"Policy\" exhibition area. This area outlines the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and introduces related financial concepts. The improvements were made in response to visitor feedback, making the interactive facilities more user-friendly, engaging, and durable, thereby enhancing the overall visitor experience.\n\nThe interactive exhibits in the \"Policy\" exhibition area of the Information Center have been upgraded.\n\nThe Information Centre's exhibition hall introduces the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking industry.\n\nTo ensure that the public, regardless of race, can equally access the facilities of the information center, the center has established procedures to provide interpretation services for visitors in need and for those who call the center’s hotline for inquiries.  \nThis version maintains the original’s emphasis on equal access (\"equally access\") while using \"regardless of race\" to align with the term 種族. It avoids redundancy by varying prepositions (\"for visitors in need\" and \"for those who call\") and employs natural phrasing like \"for inquiries\" instead of \"to inquire.\" The structure is concise, grammatically sound, and culturally appropriate for institutional contexts.\n\nThe six translations generally capture the core message but vary in fluency, terminology, and structural clarity. Key observations:\n1. **Terminology Consistency**: \"Preventative\" vs. \"preventive\" (British vs. American English) and \"Centre\" vs. \"Center\" are minor but notable. The original uses \"資訊中心\" (information center), so \"Center\" is more standard in American English unless specified otherwise.\n2. **Temporal Precision**: The original specifies \"年內\" (within the year), which is better rendered as \"this year\" rather than \"throughout the year\" (used in translations 1, 2, 5). \"This year\" aligns more closely with the temporal scope implied by the original.\n3. **Fluency and Structure**: Translations 3, 6, and 5 use smoother phrasing (e.g., \"implemented... this year, including enhanced cleaning\") compared to the awkward placement of \"enhanced cleaning and disinfection\" in translations 1, 2, and 4.\n4. **Technical Accuracy**: \"Long-lasting bactericidal coatings\" (translation 6) is more precise than \"antimicrobial\" or \"antibacterial\" (used in others), as \"殺菌塗層\" directly translates to \"bactericidal coating.\"\n5. **Redundancy**: \"Service times\" (translation 2) is redundant with \"opening hours.\" \"Operating hours\" (translation 4) is more concise.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nThe operating hours and services of the Information Center have been affected due to the ongoing pandemic. To ensure public safety and maintain a high standard of hygiene, the Center has implemented special opening arrangements and preventative measures this year, including enhanced cleaning and disinfection. Facilities and exhibits are also regularly disinfected with long-lasting bactericidal coatings.\n\n# Public and Consumer Education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) work, the HKMA held an online public education seminar in 2020, attracting over 1,600 students and teachers from 61 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA’s operations, the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, safeguarding personal digital keys, and the deposit protection scheme. This was the first time the education seminar, which has been running since 1998, was held online, with over 61,000 students and teachers participating to date.\n\nOver 1,600 teachers and students from 61 secondary schools participated in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s online public education seminar.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) educates the public to be savvy and responsible financial service consumers and maintains ongoing communication with them on this matter. A key focus of this educational work continues to be \"Protecting Personal Digital Keys.\" This year, the HKMA produced a series of short videos urging citizens to safeguard their financial accounts and personal data at all times and in all places. Given the increase in online scams during the coronavirus pandemic, the HKMA reminds the public to remain vigilant when shopping online or using personal authentication information, and to guard against fraudulent schemes.\n\nTo increase young people's interest in joining the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the HKMA launched the public education web series \"STEPS\" in 2020 and posted a series of related social media content, introducing its work in areas such as currency, the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, financial inclusion, banking supervision, and international cooperation.\n\nThe public education web series *STEPS* employs a light-hearted approach to introduce the key functions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority through the growth story of a young new employee.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in fluency and precision. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology:** \"Web drama\" (used in translations 3, 5, 6) is less standard than \"web series\" in English media contexts.  \n2. **Clarity:** \"HKMA\" (translation 1) risks ambiguity; using the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" ensures accessibility.  \n3. **Redundancy:** Phrases like \"young, newly employed individual\" (translation 3) or \"young newcomer\" (translation 5) are unnecessarily wordy.  \n4. **Flow:** The structure \"uses a light-hearted approach through the story...\" (translation 1) is slightly awkward; reordering to \"employs a light-hearted approach to introduce... through the growth story...\" improves readability.  \n5. **Nuance:** \"Relaxed and engaging\" (translation 2) adds emotional tone but deviates from the original's neutral \"light-hearted.\"  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Adopt \"web series\" for consistency with global terminology.  \n- Use \"light-hearted\" (correct spelling) to align with the original's tone.  \n- Simplify descriptors: \"young new employee\" avoids redundancy while maintaining clarity.  \n- Prioritize the full name of the authority for precision.  \n- Ensure smooth syntax by emphasizing the method (light-hearted approach) before the content (growth story) and purpose (introducing functions).  \nThe final translation balances accuracy, fluency, and cultural appropriateness while adhering to English conventions.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been widely promoting messages about protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also collaborated with various stakeholders through multiple community engagement activities, one of which is the online parent-child financial education program \"Little Financial Managers.\" This initiative teaches kindergarten and primary school students basic concepts of money and financial management, as well as fundamental knowledge about banks and payment services, through animated videos, online games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets, and coloring contests.\n\nThe animated film featuring Dollar Pig and the Kim family addresses five themes.\n\nDemonstrate how to make toys using eco-friendly materials.\n\nOther initiatives related to youth education include an online financial literacy quiz competition, online educational seminars for secondary school students and teachers, a collaboration with a professional organization to produce a comic book for primary school students and their parents, and online lectures for university students.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the Investor and Financial Education Council in enhancing the financial literacy and capabilities of Hong Kong residents, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staff\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the government structure but hires staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and high-caliber workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and flexibly respond to evolving work requirements.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had a staffing level of 1,005 in 2020. Throughout the year, the HKMA focused on flexibly allocating existing resources, improving efficiency, and streamlining work procedures to meet the needs of new projects and increasingly heavy workloads. The HKMA will maintain its staffing level at 1,005 in 2021, with existing resources being reallocated to address the following newly initiated and expanded projects:\n\n# Stability of the Banking and Financial System  \n- Support the policy development work for \"Wealth Management Connect,\" as well as other measures related to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and private wealth management, and ongoing supervision of Wealth Management Connect operations  \n- Handle licensing activities under the Insurance Ordinance and the new over-the-counter derivatives regime, as well as conduct supervision related to virtual banks  \n- Implement new regulatory requirements concerning climate risks and enhance prudential supervision of banks\n\n# Reserve Management  \n- Strengthen investment, risk management, and other necessary support to align with the Exchange Fund's continuous expansion and diversification of investment activities.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center  \n- Provide support to strengthen participation in the Financial Stability Board and other international working groups  \n- Administer the recently proposed carried interest tax concession regime and verify the eligibility of funds for tax concessions\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing establishment and actual number of staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) by department.\n\nTable 1: Position Establishment and Actual Staff Strength of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as of January 1, 2021\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the salaries and service conditions of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff by consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the views of its governing committees, and by referring to market salary levels and practices. The remuneration package includes cash compensation and a provident fund, along with basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a monthly fixed salary (i.e., basic salary) and an annual performance-based bonus.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain recommendations from the HKMA’s Governance Committee. This process considers the Governance Committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a salary survey for the financial sector conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. Individual employees with outstanding performance may also receive special salary adjustments as a reward and to maintain their competitive compensation.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed and variable compensation based on individual employee performance. The variable compensation system applicable to employees responsible for investments is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to fixed compensation and the distribution of variable compensation for Assistant Chief Executive and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee, with these employees recusing themselves from discussions regarding their own compensation proposals. For employees at or below the level of Director, adjustments to fixed compensation and the distribution of variable compensation are determined by the HKMA Chief Executive, under the Financial Secretary’s authorization, based on the lump sum approved for salary payments.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n","en":"# Institutional Social Responsibility\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, with the goal of becoming a responsible and sustainable institution. The HKMA demonstrates this commitment across various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets, caring for society at large, protecting the environment, and creating a friendly workplace.\n\nTo address the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced a series of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping Hong Kong's economy weather the crisis.\n\n# Market Environment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks affecting human well-being and the sustainability of the global economy. As a critical component of society, the financial system is inevitably impacted, and as part of this system, banks should proactively manage climate risks. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge and is implementing a series of measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include a three-phase approach to advancing the development of green and sustainable banking:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablish a common framework with the industry to assess banks' current \"green benchmarks\" and collaborate with international organizations to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase Two\n\nConsulting with the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\n\n# Phase Three\n\nFocus on implementing, reviewing, and evaluating the bank's progress in this regard.\n\nThe original text details the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) international engagement in climate-related financial initiatives. The junior translations generally capture the core content but exhibit inconsistencies in terminology, organizational names, and stylistic choices. Key observations:\n1. **Accuracy of Organizational Names**: Translations 1, 2, 3, and 5 correctly identify the \"Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)\" and \"International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF).\" However, Translation 4 incorrectly refers to the \"Financial Supervisory Commission\" instead of the HKMA, and Translation 6 omits \"HKMA\" entirely, risking ambiguity.\n2. **Terminology Consistency**: The term \"Focus Group\" (可持續金融關注組) is mistranslated as \"Interest Group\" in Translation 5, which is inaccurate. \"Focus Group\" is the standard term for such initiatives. Similarly, \"High-Level Working Group\" (高級別工作組) is inconsistently rendered as \"Work Stream\" (Translation 2) or \"Task Force\" (Translation 4), which may misrepresent the group's formal structure.\n3. **Stylistic Nuances**: Phrases like \"leverage experiences\" (Translation 1) and \"draw on the experiences and perspectives of other jurisdictions\" (Translation 2) are acceptable but vary in formality. \"Jurisdictions\" (Translation 2) is more formal than \"regions\" (Translation 1), aligning with the text's professional tone. However, \"developing its local framework\" (Translation 1) is slightly more precise than \"developing local frameworks\" (Translation 3), which uses plural unnecessarily.\n4. **Grammar and Fluency**: All translations are grammatically sound, though some exhibit minor redundancies (e.g., \"Through participation in these international organizations\" vs. \"Through its participation in these international organizations\"). The use of \"has the opportunity to contribute\" (Translations 1, 2, 5) is consistent and effective.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nOn the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) participates in multiple international organizations, including the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the High-Level Working Group on Climate-Related Financial Risks under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Sustainable Finance Focus Group under the Banking Supervision Subgroup of the East Asia and Pacific Central Bank Meeting, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF). Through its participation in these organizations, the HKMA has the opportunity to contribute to the efforts of central banks and regulators in addressing climate change, and can draw on the experiences and perspectives of other jurisdictions when developing its local framework.\n\nThe HKMA also participates in multiple working groups under the central bank and regulatory authorities' Green Finance Network, including the Microprudential Regulation Working Group, the Macrofinancial Working Group, and the Promoting Green Finance Working Group. In addition, the HKMA has joined two newly established working groups: the Research Working Group and the Data Gap Filling Working Group. The Research Working Group is responsible for conducting relevant research, while the Data Gap Filling Working Group aims to develop a comprehensive list of data items required by regulators and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, which are currently not available. Details regarding the HKMA's efforts in promoting green and sustainable banking development during the year are provided in the \"Banking System Stability\" chapter.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Green Commercial Banking Alliance with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in November to assist banks in emerging markets in developing strategies to address climate change. As a founding member and the first regional executive director of the alliance, the HKMA i) promotes the development of green commercial banking in global financial markets; ii) provides a platform for commercial banks to engage in mutual learning, acquiring the necessary knowledge, tools, and business intelligence to formulate their own green finance roadmaps and transition into credible green banks; iii) facilitates communication and explores cutting-edge issues to advance the global green agenda; and iv) assists alliance members in collaboration to capitalize on the estimated $23 trillion in green and climate-related investment opportunities in emerging markets identified by the IFC over the next decade.\n\nLocally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborates with other financial regulators to coordinate the financial sector's measures in addressing climate and environmental risks. In addition to assisting the government in implementing its green bond program, the HKMA has also jointly established the Inter-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to handle cross-sectoral regulatory and market development issues. Details of the HKMA's efforts in advancing Hong Kong's development as a global hub for green and sustainable finance this year can be found in the chapter titled \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center.\"\n\n# Inter-Institutional Oversight Committee on Green and Sustainable Finance\nThe term \"跨機構\" (cross-institutional\/inter-institutional) is accurately rendered in all translations, though \"Inter-Institutional\" is more formal and precise than \"Cross-Institutional\" or \"Inter-Agency.\" \"督導小組\" (supervision group) presents more nuance: \"Steering Committee\" emphasizes strategic guidance, while \"Oversight Committee\" focuses on monitoring. \"Task Force\" implies temporary urgency, which may not align with the original's institutional permanence. \"Supervision Group\" is too generic. \"Steering Committee\" best captures the proactive, directive role implied by \"督導.\" \"Committee\" is more formal and appropriate for institutional structures than \"Group\" or \"Forum.\" The title should balance precision with natural English usage. \"Inter-Institutional Oversight Committee\" is the most accurate and fluent option, as it maintains institutional specificity while clearly conveying the supervisory function.\n\nThe steering group aims to coordinate the financial sector’s response to climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government’s climate strategy. Established jointly by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in May, the group includes members from the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its establishment, the Steering Group has set up two technical working groups, one responsible for researching and handling cross-departmental regulatory matters, and the other for coordinating cross-institutional market development efforts.\n\nThe Steering Group released the Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy in December, outlining six areas to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem and build a greener and more sustainable future in the long term. The Steering Group also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues during the development process.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) held the inaugural meeting of its supervisory committee, with Mr. Yu Wai-man, the HKMA's Chief Executive (third from the right), serving as co-chairman of the committee.\n\nThe steering group released Hong Kong's Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy and five key action plans.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports responsible investment, which integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment activities. As a major asset owner, the HKMA’s growing emphasis on responsible investment will influence how its fund managers conduct their investment activities.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Belief\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it will more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce ESG-related risks associated with investment activities.\n\n# Principles of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nAccording to the guiding principles adopted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), ESG investments are generally given priority when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment options. As a responsible long-term investor, the HKMA incorporates the following principles of responsible investment into its investment management process, depending on the circumstances:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that ESG factors will have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects and therefore integrates them into its investment analysis process to identify risks and uncover opportunities. The HKMA incorporates ESG factors into the investment management processes of both public and private markets.\n\n# Proactive Exercise of Asset Ownership  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning of \"actively exercising ownership over assets,\" but several nuances require refinement. Key considerations include:  \n1. **Adverb vs. Adjective Placement**: \"Proactively\" (adverb) and \"Proactive\" (adjective) differ in formality and flow. \"Proactive\" as an adjective (\"Proactive Exercise\") is more concise and natural in formal contexts.  \n2. **\"Ownership\" vs. \"Ownership Rights\"**: While \"擁有權\" technically includes \"rights,\" the phrase \"Asset Ownership\" is sufficient in English, avoiding redundancy. Adding \"rights\" may overcomplicate the term.  \n3. **Verb Form**: Using \"Exercise\" as a noun (\"Exercise of Asset Ownership\") is standard in legal\/financial contexts, whereas gerunds like \"Exercising\" feel less polished.  \n4. **Fluency**: Phrases like \"Actively Exercising\" or \"Proactively Exercise\" lack the balanced structure of noun phrases, which are preferred for titles or formal headings.  \nThe optimal translation balances precision, conciseness, and natural English phrasing. \"Proactive Exercise of Asset Ownership\" (Translation 4) achieves this, with minor adjustments to ensure clarity and professionalism.  \nProactive Exercise of Asset Ownership\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) appropriately exercises its shareholder rights in listed companies it holds shares in, to safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behavior considering ESG factors will contribute to long-term shareholder value. The HKMA expects external investment managers to actively exercise ownership rights by exercising voting rights and communicating with investee companies, thereby assisting the HKMA in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities over its investment portfolios.\n\n#Collaboration\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to collaborating with like-minded investors and regulators to promote sound long-term investment management practices. It also participates in public events and delivers speeches to share best practices in ESG operations and encourage the investment community to adopt responsible investment principles.\n\nFor details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work on responsible investment this year, see the \"Reserve Management\" chapter.\n\n# As a proactive and responsible investor, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority oversees the ESG practices of its external investment managers.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Expectations\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) places significant emphasis on integrating ESG factors into investment decisions and proactively exercising ownership rights. To this end, the HKMA considers ESG factors when selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. As the HKMA believes that exercising shareholder rights over listed company shares it holds is a fundamental principle for safeguarding the long-term value of its investments, it requires appointed investment managers to take the proactive exercise of ownership rights seriously.\n\n# Oversight by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nExternal investment managers are required to have their ESG performance in managing listed equity portfolios on behalf of the HKMA assessed. Through a communication program, the HKMA systematically reviews the ESG practices of external investment managers across various areas, including their ESG evaluation frameworks, engagement with investee companies, and proxy voting activities. In 2020, the HKMA selected a number of external investment managers to participate in a pilot communication program, during which not only their ESG performance was evaluated, but also whether they appropriately exercised asset stewardship on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication Outcomes\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Hong Kong identifies external investment managers with problematic operational practices through its program and takes follow-up actions. The following are two examples.\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) noted that Stock Investment Manager A's ESG framework had room for improvement, particularly in establishing a more systematic approach to evaluating investee companies. The HKMA followed up with A, which subsequently conducted a comprehensive review of its corporate policies to implement a more robust ESG framework. A further engaged external consultants to provide input on ESG processes, demonstrating a commitment to accelerating reforms, and established an ESG committee composed of senior management, highlighting the organization's commitment to ESG and the support from senior management for these initiatives.\n\n# Case 2\n\nAfter reviewing the translations, the primary issues are:  \n1. **Institutional Accuracy**: Only translations 1, 3, 4, and 5 correctly identify the authority as the **Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)**. Translation 2 incorrectly uses \"Financial Supervisory Commission,\" and 6 omits \"Hong Kong.\"  \n2. **Terminology Consistency**: \"Stock investment manager\" (translations 1, 4, 5) is more precise than \"stock fund manager\" (translations 3, 6).  \n3. **Redundancy**: Translation 6 redundantly uses \"its company's voting policy\" (redundant \"its\" and \"company's\").  \n4. **Fluency**: Phrases like \"increasing the involvement of ESG team members\" (translations 1, 3, 4, 6) are slightly wordy; \"enhancing ESG team involvement\" is more concise.  \n5. **Nuance**: \"Deviate from its own proxy voting guidelines\" (translations 1, 2, 3, 5) is accurate, but \"deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines\" (translations 4, 6) is smoother.  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nAfter reviewing the voting practices of stock investment manager B, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) identified deficiencies in B’s voting policy across multiple areas and requested its ESG head to conduct a review. Notably, B had fully supported all management proposals in past votes, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently committed to strengthening its voting policy to meet expectations, including enhancing ESG team involvement and potentially voting against management on issues involving significant governance matters.\n\nIn the realm of private market investments, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) achieves responsible investing through its dedicated fund managers, who actively collaborate with relevant portfolio companies on ESG matters. The HKMA has observed that these designated partners consistently uphold their commitment to ESG principles, as they believe this approach helps create long-term value for portfolio companies and ensures the sustainability of returns. The two examples outlined below illustrate how climate change risks can be managed through (i) design modifications and the application of innovative operational technologies, as well as (ii) integrating carbon-reduction factors into the construction and operation of green and sustainable warehouses. Both examples have made significant positive environmental impacts, reducing carbon emissions and avoiding harmful substances, while simultaneously enhancing operational efficiency through cost reduction and energy conservation.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has invested in a pest control company that employs environmentally friendly solutions. While traditional pesticides and chemical products can effectively kill pests, failure to promptly remove or properly dispose of carcasses can pose a threat to public health. Furthermore, leakage and improper disposal of chemical components can cause environmental problems. The company’s approach utilizes non-biocidal pest control methods, employing traps to reduce the use of harmful chemicals. It also uses internet-connected dynamic sensors to remotely monitor pest capture rates. This new technology allows the company to optimize collection routes for captured pests, reducing travel distances and thereby lowering carbon emissions. The company’s solution results in a net carbon footprint of just 0.36 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of net sales—a remarkably low level comparable to low-carbon industries such as legal services and software publishing, a truly encouraging achievement.\n\n(ii) The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has invested in green and sustainable warehouses. Although the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the relevant warehouse developers have adopted net-zero carbon emission procedures throughout their warehouse construction and operations, establishing standards and metrics to measure net-zero carbon benchmarks. Their construction plans also prioritize the sustainability of materials and components used. As a result, the warehouses built achieve high carbon reduction efficiency and incorporate sustainable features, including solar water heating systems, electric vehicle charging facilities, natural daylighting, and rainwater harvesting.\n\nAccording to an independent consultant's assessment, the carbon footprint of the warehouse construction, calculated on a net basis, is 25.8% lower than that of a typical logistics building.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第187至289頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2020年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2020年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2021年4月1日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註32。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 符合準則聲明\n\n本財務報表是按照香港財務報告準則（此乃綜合詞彙，包括香港會計師公會頒布的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋）及香港公認會計原則而編製。有關基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會頒布了若干新增或經修訂的香港財務報告準則並於集團的本會計期首次生效或可供提前採納。集團因首次採納其中適用的準則而引致本會計期及前會計期的會計政策改變（如有）已反映在本財務報表，有關資料載於附註3。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團於聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務載於附註17及18。\n\n本財務報表的編製基準是按原值成本法計量，惟下述按公平值計量的資產及負債除外：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入收支帳目的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入其他全面收益的金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.11）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，而有關判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的採納及資產、負債、收入及支出的呈報數額。此等估計及相關的假設是根據以往經驗及其他在有關情況下認為合適的因素而制定。在欠缺其他現成數據的情況下，則採用此等估計及假設作為判斷有關資產及負債的帳面值的基準，估計結果與實際價值或有不同。\n\n此等估計及相關假設將不斷檢討修訂。如作出的修訂只影響本會計期，有關修訂會在該期間內確認，但如影響本期及未來的會計期，有關修訂便會在該期及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層就採納香港財務報告準則所作出對財務報表有重大影響的判斷以及估計不確定性的主要來源於附註2.19披露。\n\n若干2019年的比較數字已重新分類，以配合本年度集團財務報表的呈報方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指集團所控制的實體。如集團因其參與該實體的營運而承擔有關浮動回報的風險或享有有關權利，且有能力對該實體行使權力而影響該等回報時，即屬擁有該實體的控制權。在評估集團是否擁有權力時，只考慮由集團及其他方所持有的實質權利。\n","en":"# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\nThe translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies. All correctly identify \"Independent Auditor's Report\" as the title format, with variations in punctuation (apostrophe vs. possessive phrasing) and the inclusion of a hashtag (#). The hashtag is unnecessary in formal English document titles, as it is not standard in official reporting contexts. The possessive form \"Independent Auditor's Report\" is more concise and commonly used in such titles compared to \"Report of the Independent Auditor,\" which is grammatically correct but less idiomatic. The fourth translation uses a curly apostrophe (’), which is stylistically inconsistent with standard English typography (straight apostrophe ’). The best translation omits the hashtag and uses the possessive form with a straight apostrophe, aligning with formal English conventions.\n\n#Opinions\n\nThis is to certify that we have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), which are set out on pages 187 to 289. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2020, and the statement of income, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2020, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as well as in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Office. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by these standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\nThe original term \"關鍵審計事項\" is a standard heading in audit reports, typically translated as \"Key Audit Matters\" in professional contexts. All junior translations correctly captured the core term, but there were inconsistencies in formatting. The use of a hashtag (#) is not standard in formal English audit documentation, where headings are usually presented in title case without special characters. While some translations included the hashtag (e.g., \"# Key Audit Matters\"), this deviates from conventional professional formatting. The most appropriate approach is to omit the hashtag and present the heading in standard title case, as seen in authoritative audit standards. The term \"matters\" is preferred over \"issues\" in this context, as it aligns with terminology used by regulatory bodies like the PCAOB. The final translation should reflect both linguistic accuracy and professional formatting norms.\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. I addressed these matters in the course of my audit of, and in forming my opinion on, the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for other information. This information includes all the content in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2020 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I do not issue any form of attestation conclusion on such other information.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and formality. Key considerations:  \n1. **\"Cover\" vs. \"Extend to\":** \"Extend to\" (as in Translation 2 and 6) is more precise in formal contexts, aligning with the nuance of \"並不涵蓋\" (does not cover).  \n2. **\"Attestation\" vs. \"Assurance\":** \"Attestation conclusion\" (Translations 1, 3, 5) directly reflects \"鑒證結論,\" while \"assurance conclusion\" (Translations 2, 6) is a broader term. Given the original’s specificity, \"attestation\" is more accurate.  \n3. **\"Information\" vs. \"Data\"\/\"Materials\":** \"Other information\" (Translations 1, 3, 5) is preferable to \"data\" (Translation 4) or \"materials\" (Translation 6), as \"資料\" typically refers to information in financial contexts.  \n4. **Redundancy:** Phrases like \"also do not\" (Translations 1, 3, 5) are redundant; the original lacks this emphasis.  \n5. **Consistency:** Using \"such other information\" (as in the final translation) avoids repetition while maintaining clarity.  \nThe improved translation integrates these elements for precision, formality, and conciseness.\n\nWith regard to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information to assess whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with information obtained during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no such report.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Management Officer must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing matters related to the going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe original sentence requires precise translation of institutional titles and formal terminology. All six translations correctly identify the \"Audit Committee\" and its supervisory role. However, key differences exist in the rendering of \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" (Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee) and the capitalization of \"Group.\" \nThe first and fourth translations use \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" which is the most literal and accurate rendering of \"外匯基金.\" The second, third, fifth, and sixth translations use \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee,\" omitting \"Foreign,\" which may be acceptable in some contexts but risks ambiguity. Since the original explicitly includes \"外匯\" (foreign exchange), retaining \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" preserves specificity.\nRegarding \"Group,\" the original uses \"集團\" (a proper noun referring to a specific organization), which should be capitalized in English. Translations 3, 4, and 6 correctly capitalize \"Group,\" while others use lowercase, which is less precise. \nThe verbs \"overseeing\" and \"supervising\" are both grammatically correct, but \"overseeing\" is more commonly used in formal financial contexts, making it slightly more natural here. \nThe best translation should retain the full name of the committee, capitalize \"Group,\" and use \"overseeing\" for consistency with formal financial terminology.\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The Responsibilities of Auditors for the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. A misstatement may arise from fraud or error and is considered material if it could reasonably be expected, individually or in aggregate, to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:  \n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error;  \n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;  \n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;  \n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw users’ attention to the related disclosures in the auditor’s report. If those disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor’s report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;  \n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and  \n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.  \nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explaining that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements concerning independence, and communicating with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be considered to affect my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nBased on the provided translations, the key areas for improvement include:  \n1. **Terminology Accuracy**: \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" should be \"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" (used in translations 2, 6) rather than \"External Funds Advisory Committee\" (translation 1) or \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" (translation 5).  \n2. **Tense Consistency**: The original uses \"我會決定\" (future tense), which should be rendered as \"I will determine\" (translations 2, 5, 6) rather than \"I determine\" (translations 1, 3, 4).  \n3. **Clarity of Conditions**: The phrase \"合理預期...負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益\" requires precise rendering of \"reasonable expectation\" and the balance between negative consequences and public interest. Translation 5 captures this well with \"reasonable expectation that communicating... would result in adverse consequences that would outweigh the public benefit.\"  \n4. **Redundancy and Flow**: Some translations (e.g., 3, 4) repeat \"in my report\" unnecessarily. Translation 6 streamlines this with \"derived from such communication.\"  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nBased on the original text, the most accurate and fluent translation integrates precise terminology, future tense, and clear articulation of conditions:  \n\"Based on my communications with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most significant for the audit of the current financial statements and therefore constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in my auditor’s report, unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances when I determine that the negative consequences of communicating the matter in my report would outweigh the public interest derived from such communication.\"\n\nAuditor General Zhu Nai Zhang\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\n# 1. Main Business\nThe original text \"# 1 主要業務\" presents a numbered heading for a section about core business operations. The junior translations exhibit several issues:\n1. **Formatting**: The use of \"#\" (hash symbol) is inappropriate in English business documents, where numbering typically uses \"1.\" or \"1.\" without symbols. Translations 1, 2, 4, and 5 incorrectly retain the hashtag.\n2. **Terminology**: \n   - \"Main Businesses\" (Translation 1) is grammatically incorrect in this context, as \"主要業務\" refers to a singular core business area, not multiple businesses.\n   - \"Main Business Operations\" (Translation 5) and \"Main Business Activities\" (Translation 6) are overly verbose and less natural than the concise \"Main Business.\"\n   - \"Main Business\" (Translations 3 and 6) is the most accurate and commonly used term in English business contexts.\n3. **Punctuation**: The correct format for numbered headings in English is \"1. [Term]\" (e.g., \"1. Main Business\"), which only Translation 3 achieves correctly.\n**Improvements**: The optimal translation should use standard English numbering (\"1.\") and the precise term \"Main Business,\" avoiding unnecessary verbosity or incorrect symbols. The third junior translator's \"1. Main Business\" is the closest to ideal but could be refined slightly for clarity and concision.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer manages the Exchange Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66), exercising powers conferred by the Financial Secretary in his capacity as the Fund's manager. The Fund's primary functions are to defend the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system.\n\nThe fund's assets are managed in four distinct portfolios: the Support Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Asset Portfolio. Under Hong Kong's currency board system, the assets of the Support Portfolio are fully matched to the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the debt and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), which were purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for strategic purposes and are recorded in the fund's accounts. Information on the operating segments is presented in Note 32.\n\n# 2 Significant Accounting Policies\n\n# 2.1 Declaration of Compliance with Guidelines\n\nThese financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS), which comprise all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards, and interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as well as Hong Kong Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (HKGAAP). A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Group\") is set out below.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued certain new or revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS), which became effective for the Group's current accounting period or were available for early adoption. Any changes in accounting policies resulting from the Group's first-time adoption of applicable standards during the current and prior accounting periods are reflected in these financial statements, with related information disclosed in Note 3.\n\n# 2.2 Basis for Preparation of Financial Statements\n\nThe group's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the group itself, as well as the group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal business activities of the main subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures are set out in Notes 17 and 18.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities measured at fair value:  \n- Derivative financial instruments (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (Note 2.6);  \n- Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (Note 2.6);  \n- Gold (Note 2.10); and  \n- Investment property (Note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions, which affect the adoption of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. These estimates and related assumptions are based on past experience and other factors deemed appropriate in the circumstances. In the absence of other readily available data, these estimates and assumptions are used as the basis for determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, and the resulting estimates may differ from their actual values.\n\nThese estimates and related assumptions will be continuously reviewed and revised. If the revisions affect only the current accounting period, they will be recognized within that period; however, if they affect both the current and future accounting periods, they will be recognized in the current period and subsequent periods.  \nThese estimates and related assumptions will be continuously reviewed and revised. If the revisions affect only the current accounting period, they will be recognized within that period; however, if they affect both the current and future accounting periods, they will be recognized in the current period and subsequent periods.\n\nThe primary sources of uncertainty in management's judgments and estimates regarding the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, which have a significant impact on the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.19.\n\nCertain 2019 comparative figures have been reclassified to align with the presentation format of the Group's financial statements for the current year.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and Non-controlling Interests\n\nA subsidiary refers to an entity controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group, by virtue of its involvement in the entity’s operations, is exposed to risks or entitled to rights related to variable returns, and possesses the power to direct the entity’s activities in a manner that affects those returns. When determining whether the Group holds control, only the substantive rights held by the Group and other parties are considered.\n"}
