{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","en":"# CEO Report\n\n2018 marked the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis. Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone profound transformations, with events unfolding that even the most imaginative screenwriters could not have envisioned. In last year’s annual report, I noted that the 2017 financial market performance was “unexpectedly positive,” while also highlighting “underlying concerns” about the outlook. Looking back at 2018, it might be characterized as “initial optimism followed by sorrow.” Shortly after global stock indices hit record highs in January, the fervent investment sentiment was abruptly met with the cold front of U.S.-China trade tensions, compounded by prolonged Brexit negotiations, deteriorating geopolitical conditions, and four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. This led to a sharp reversal of market optimism and a significant decline in asset prices throughout the year. The MSCI Global Index fell 20.3% from its peak to its trough, with a cumulative decline of about 10% for the year, marking the worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 26.7% from its peak, declining 13.6% for the year, recording its largest annual drop in seven years.\n\n# Lianhui's Steadfastness, the Pillar of Confidence\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original text combines a proper noun (\"聯匯\") with a metaphor (\"穩健 信心所繫\"), emphasizing stability as the foundation of confidence. The junior translations vary in accuracy and fluency:  \n- **Translation 1** (\"Stable and Steady, the Foundation of Confidence\") is concise but omits \"聯匯\" and feels generic.  \n- **Translation 2** (\"Steady collaboration, confidence rests upon it\") misinterprets \"聯匯\" as \"collaboration\" and uses awkward phrasing.  \n- **Translation 3** (\"United and Steady, the Pillar of Confidence\") incorrectly assumes \"聯匯\" means \"United\" and lacks clarity.  \n- **Translation 4** (\"Stable exchange rates are key to confidence\") adds context not present in the original.  \n- **Translation 5** (\"Lianhui's Steadfastness, Where Confidence Lies\") correctly identifies \"聯匯\" as a proper noun and uses poetic phrasing, though \"Where Confidence Lies\" is slightly verbose.  \n- **Translation 6** (\"Steady Union Exchange, Confidence Relies On\") misinterprets \"聯匯\" and uses awkward phrasing.  \n**Improvements:**  \n1. Retain \"Lianhui\" as a proper noun for accuracy.  \n2. Use \"Steadfastness\" or \"Steadiness\" to capture \"穩健\" concisely.  \n3. Employ \"Pillar of Confidence\" or \"Foundation of Confidence\" for the metaphor, balancing brevity and impact.  \n4. Ensure the hashtag is preserved for consistency with the original.  \nThe final translation synthesizes these elements for clarity, cultural appropriateness, and fluency.\n\nDespite the volatile and unpredictable external environment, Hong Kong's financial system has remained resilient, with the money market operating smoothly and unimpeded. The linked exchange rate system, in place for 35 years, has successfully withstood the test of capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HK$1 trillion in capital inflows into the Hong Kong dollar has accumulated. Last year, as U.S. interest rates rose, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the U.S. continued to widen, leading to increased carry trade activity of selling Hong Kong dollars and buying U.S. dollars. The Hong Kong dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar at the beginning of the year, and the \"weak-side exchange guarantee,\" established in 2005, was triggered for the first time in April and again 26 times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in accordance with established mechanisms, fulfilled the weak-side exchange guarantee by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling U.S. dollars, orderly and transparently absorbing HK$103.5 billion in Hong Kong dollar sell orders in the market. As capital flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) rose by 105 basis points in 2018, and banks also raised their prime lending rates following the U.S. interest rate hike in September of last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and timely explained the operational mechanism of the \"weak-side exchange guarantee\" to the public through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable part of the normalization of Hong Kong's interest rates and the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Hong Kong linked exchange rate system at the end of last year, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government also emphasized that the linked exchange rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary stability. This has helped to maintain the confidence of Hong Kong residents in the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Banking System: Steady Progress Amid Stability\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, phrasing, and flow. Key observations:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Prudent regulation\" vs. \"prudent supervision\" (the latter aligns better with \"審慎監管\" in the original). \"Loss absorption capacity\" is more precise than \"loss absorbency\" or \"loss-absorbing capacity.\"  \n2. **Consistency**: \"Resolution mechanisms\" (used in most translations) is preferable to \"resolution regimes\" or \"resolution oversight.\"  \n3. **Fluency**: Some translations use redundant phrases (e.g., \"sound and prudent manner\") or awkward phrasing (e.g., \"structural modification resolution plans\").  \n4. **Cultural\/Contextual Nuance**: The term \"too big to fail\" is correctly used, but \"public funds\" could be clarified as \"public money\" for conciseness.  \n**Improvements**: Standardize terminology (e.g., \"prudent supervision,\" \"loss absorption capacity\"), streamline phrasing for clarity, and ensure consistency in references to institutions (e.g., \"Financial Stability Board\" without \"under the G20\" unless necessary).  \n---\nThe 2008 global financial crisis exposed numerous hidden flaws and risks within the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to implement a series of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including enhanced corporate governance and risk management in banking supervision. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) focuses its banking supervision on two key areas: first, prudent supervision of banks’ balance sheet risks, and second, banks’ conduct and ethical standards—both of which are equally critical.  \nIn terms of balance sheet risk supervision, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, the HKMA has a responsibility to fully implement international regulatory standards, ensuring the Hong Kong banking sector operates in a sound and prudent manner. By the end of last year, Hong Kong banks achieved a capital adequacy ratio of 20.3%, significantly exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8% and marking a substantial improvement from the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. In the fourth quarter of last year, the average liquidity coverage ratio of major banks reached 167.6%, far above the statutory minimum requirement of 90%.  \nTo avoid repeating the mistakes of the global financial crisis—where public money was used to rescue \"too big to fail\" financial institutions—the Financial Stability Board established international standards for financial institution resolution mechanisms. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that has fully implemented these requirements. The HKMA’s Resolution Mechanism Office is currently operationalizing the mechanism’s details, requiring banks to implement structural changes to ensure resolution plans can be effectively executed when needed. Last year, the HKMA introduced the \"Loss Absorption Capacity Rules,\" with more related regulations to follow in the future.\n\nGiven the sustained rise in property prices, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) took proactive measures, implementing eight rounds of countercyclical policies between 2009 and 2017 to ensure the local banking system had sufficient resilience to withstand potential shocks should the property market reverse. These measures proved highly effective: the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018; the average debt-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. During the year, bank credit grew modestly by 4.4%, with overall asset quality remaining strong. The non-performing loan ratio for retail banking further declined to 0.5%, far below both international and local historical averages. Banking sector profitability continued to grow last year, with the overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%. Several international banking groups achieved strong performance in their Hong Kong operations, becoming key contributors to their group profits.\n\n# Steadfast and Virtuous Culture: Leaders Lead by Example, Followers Follow  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original phrase \"穩善文化 上行下效\" combines two key concepts: \"穩善文化\" (Steadfast and Virtuous Culture) and \"上行下效\" (Leaders lead by example, followers follow). The junior translations vary in accuracy and fluency.  \n1. **Translation 1** (\"Steadfast Virtue Culture Lead by Example, Follow Suit\") is concise but lacks clarity in the relationship between \"lead\" and \"follow.\" The phrase \"Follow Suit\" is awkward in this context.  \n2. **Translation 2** (\"Stable and Virtuous Culture: Leading by Example from Above, Following by Example from Below\") is detailed but overly wordy. \"From Above\" and \"From Below\" are redundant, as \"leading\" and \"following\" already imply direction.  \n3. **Translation 3** (\"Cultivate virtue through stability, and let it be emulated by those above and below\") misrepresents the original structure, shifting focus from leadership to cultivation.  \n4. **Translation 4** (\"Leading by example, fostering widespread virtue\") omits the cultural context and directional nuance of \"上行下效.\"  \n5. **Translation 5** (\"# Stable and Virtuous Culture: Above Sets the Example, Below Follows\") is concise and captures the directional relationship but uses \"Above\" and \"Below\" in a way that feels abrupt.  \n6. **Translation 6** (\"# Wen Shan Culture Leading by Example\") misinterprets \"穩善\" as a proper noun (\"Wen Shan\") and omits the \"followers follow\" component.  \n**Improvements:**  \nThe best approach balances conciseness with clarity. \"Steadfast and Virtuous Culture: Leaders Lead by Example, Followers Follow\" retains the original structure, uses natural English phrasing, and explicitly connects leadership with followership. It avoids redundancy, preserves the cultural nuance of \"上行下效,\" and ensures grammatical fluency.\n\nIn regulating the conduct of banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Bank Conduct Division in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To address both symptoms and root causes of misconduct, in addition to setting regulatory requirements targeting fundamental banking conduct, we have vigorously promoted cultural reforms in recent years. We encourage banks to foster a sound banking culture through governance, reward systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms, aiming to ensure that ethical standards are modeled from the top down, thereby restoring and enhancing customers’ trust and respect for banks. Following the provision of specific guidelines to all Hong Kong banks in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on banking culture by the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments of their corporate culture and implementation of related measures, ensuring the effective execution of the three pillars of a sound banking culture.\n\nAlthough the internet and mobile finance are global trends, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to promote financial inclusion last year, addressing communities unable to access new technologies. For example, we collaborated with the Hong Kong Bankers' Association to encourage convenience stores to offer elderly customers withdrawal services via the \"EasyGo\" platform, enabling cash withdrawals without purchasing goods. The network of participating stores has now expanded to over 300 locations. We also partnered with Hong Kong Post to launch the Elderly Withdrawal Service at seven main post offices located in outlying islands and the New Territories. In response to the HKMA’s recommendations, the banking industry actively enhanced accessibility features throughout the year, providing inclusive banking services for people with disabilities and the elderly. One example is the more than tenfold increase in ATMs equipped with voice navigation, reaching over 700 units within a year. Additionally, under the HKMA’s proactive promotion, we anticipate that banks will gradually open more physical branches and introduce mobile banking services in remote areas, further facilitating public access.\n\n# Smart Banking: A Revolutionary Experience\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely collaborated with banks and the technology sector to launch the \"New Era of Smart Banking\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of Hong Kong's financial technology and offering citizens a new experience in payment and banking services. A highlight of 2018 was undoubtedly the official launch of the \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System) in September. As the world's first retail fast payment system, it broke down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, enabling citizens to enjoy 24\/7 instant transfers of Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi. The HKMA also simultaneously introduced the world's first \"Shared QR Code\" standard and application, allowing merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems using a single QR code. Since its launch, FPS has been widely welcomed by the public. Within just six months, the number of registrations exceeded 2.58 million, with an average of 60,000 daily transactions, each averaging HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 respectively.\n\nLast May, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued licensing guidelines for virtual banks, prompting 33 institutions to submit applications. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have already been granted, with the institutions expected to commence operations within the year. Virtual banks will help drive the development and innovation of Hong Kong's fintech sector, providing innovative services and experiences for individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released an Open Application Programming Interface (OpenAPI) framework in July, under which banks will open external interfaces for their products and services in four phases, fostering a more flexible and open financial technology environment. This will enable bank customers to more conveniently integrate account information, access information, and select services that best meet their needs. Throughout the year, a total of 42 new technology products utilized the HKMA’s FinTech Regulatory Sandbox for testing, with 28 completing trials and their corresponding products and services successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with multiple banks, officially launched \"Trade Link\" in October last year. This trade financing platform, which utilizes distributed ledger technology, will enhance the efficiency of banks in approving trade financing. \"Trade Link\" is currently testing connections with related platforms in other regions to facilitate cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFinTech is not only widely used in daily life but has also extended into compliance and regulatory fields in recent years. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) encourages banks to leverage compliance technology (RegTech) to assist with daily operations, such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the HKMA is exploring the use of supervisory technology (SupTech) to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Financial Strength: Consolidate and Enhance\n\nThe competition among international financial centers is a contest of soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in the economic, social, and technological landscape, seize opportunities, and constantly open up new development space for Hong Kong's financial sector. Green finance represents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its bond and project financing markets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports and collaborates with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in developing green finance. In addition to assisting the SAR Government in preparing a HKD 100 billion government green bond issuance program, we held multiple green finance seminars last year, including two major international conferences, to enhance market awareness, understanding, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuers to participate in the government's green bond grant scheme launched last year and Hong Kong's green finance certification services. The scale of green bonds issued in Hong Kong last year exceeded USD 11 billion, more than three times the amount in 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown growing interest in infrastructure and related projects. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016, and its network of partners has since more than doubled in number to 95 institutions, making it a key platform for infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the HKMA and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council jointly held a high-level roundtable meeting for the first time, discussing Hong Kong’s unique advantages and role in supporting the \"going global\" strategy of central state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This meeting laid a solid foundation for future collaborative development opportunities between these enterprises and Hong Kong’s financial and professional services sectors.\n"}

The junior translations exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and appropriateness:\n1. **\"Currency stability\"** is grammatically correct but uses \"currency\" (a narrower term referring to physical money) instead of \"monetary\" (which encompasses broader financial systems). This subtle distinction is critical in economic contexts.\n2. **\"#MonetaryStability\"** and **\"# Monetary Stability\"** incorrectly add hashtags, which are irrelevant to the original text. The space after the hashtag in the third translation violates standard formatting conventions.\n3. **\"Monetary Stability\"** (fourth translation) is the most accurate, using the precise economic terminology and maintaining the original's brevity. However, it lacks the hashtag used in some translations, which may be context-dependent.\n4. **\"Currency Stability\"** (first and sixth translations) is technically correct but less precise than \"monetary stability\" in formal economic discourse.\n**Improvements**: The optimal translation should retain the exact terminology (\"monetary stability\") while avoiding unnecessary hashtags. The fourth translation achieves this, but \"monetary\" is slightly more formal and precise than \"currency\" in this context. The hashtag should be omitted unless explicitly required by the context (e.g., social media). The space after the hashtag in the third translation must be corrected.\n\n# April 12th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s weak-side convertibility undertaking at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 U.S. dollar was triggered during London trading hours, marking the first time since the HKMA introduced three measures to optimize the linked exchange rate system in 2005 that the undertaking has been activated. In 2018, the weak-side convertibility undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times.\n\n#July24th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the three note-issuing banks announced the launch of the 2018 Hong Kong New Banknote Series.\n\n# October 26th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the designation of nine licensed institutions as primary liquidity providers in Hong Kong's offshore RMB market.\n\n# Banking System\n\n# January 10th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that the countercyclical capital buffer applicable to Hong Kong will be increased from 1.875% to 2.5%, effective January 1, 2019.\n\n# February 2nd\n\nThe 2018 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance has been gazetted.\n\n# February 28\n\nThe Financial Stability Board issued a peer review report on Hong Kong, confirming that Hong Kong has made commendable progress in recent years in reforming the over-the-counter derivatives market and establishing a financial institution resolution framework.\n\n#March23\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority facilitated the Hong Kong Bankers' Association in issuing the \"Practical Guidelines for Accessible Banking Services.\"\n\n# May 4th\n\nThe 2018 Banking (Disclosure) (Amendment) Rules and the 2018 Banking (Specified Multilateral Development Banks) (Amendment) Notice were gazetted.\n\n# May 18th\n\nThe Gazette Notice on the Effective Date of the Banking Ordinance (Amendment) 2018 and the Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules has been gazetted.\n\n# May 30th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued the revised guidelines on the authorization of virtual banks following the completion of public consultation.\n\n# October 3\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted the 2nd Edition of the Conference on Independent Non-Executive Directors in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 19\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Regime) (Loss Absorption Capacity Provisions – Banking Sector) Rules (the \"Loss Absorption Capacity Rules\") and the related Taxation (Amendment) (No. 6) Bill 2018 have been gazetted.\n\n# October 26th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Macao Financial Services Bureau signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly implement professional training and mutual recognition of qualifications under the Banking Professional Qualifications Framework.\n\n#November16\n\nThe original text lists four legal documents gazetted in 2018. The junior translations exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Key issues include inconsistent terminology (e.g., \"Risk Limitation\" vs. \"Risk Exposure Limits\"), improper use of \"Regulation\" instead of \"Ordinance,\" and awkward phrasing like \"Notice of the Gazette on the Coming into Force.\" The fifth translation most accurately captures the structure and terminology but could improve parallelism and clarity. The best translation should use \"Notice\" for the first document, maintain \"Risk Exposure Limits,\" and ensure parallel phrasing for all items, ending with \"have been gazetted.\"\nThe following have been gazetted: the 2018 Banking Ordinance (Amendment) Notice (Effective Date) (No. 2), the Banking (Risk Exposure Limits) Rules, the 2018 Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules, and the 2018 Banking (Disclosure) (Amendment) (No. 2) Rules.\n\n# December 14th\n\nThe Loss Absorption Capacity Rule takes effect.\n\n# December 19\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced regulatory measures on banking culture, including self-assessment, thematic assessments, and banking culture dialogues, to gauge the progress of banking culture reform in Hong Kong.\n\n# December 21st\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has announced the latest list of institutions designated as locally systemically important.\n\n# Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\n# January 23rd\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Swiss Federal Department of Finance have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to strengthen financial cooperation in areas including the internationalization of the RMB, wealth management, infrastructure financing, and international financial affairs. The HKMA has also signed an MOU with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to promote financial innovation in both jurisdictions.\n\n# January 31st\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched an enhanced version of the \"FinTech Talent Development Program\" (FCAS 2.0), aiming to strengthen the development of local FinTech professionals to meet the growing demand in the industry.\n\n#March9th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) exchanged a Memorandum of Understanding to promote cooperation in financial technology between the two parties.\n\n# March 27-28\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) co-hosted a two-day workshop for administrative personnel with the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.\n\n# May 15th\n\nIFFO and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association co-hosted a seminar titled \"Building a Sustainable Belt and Road Initiative: Hong Kong's Key Role.\"  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Organization Name:** \"Hong Kong Association of Banks\" (used in translations 1, 5) is incorrect; the official name is \"Hong Kong Bankers' Association\" (with an apostrophe).  \n2. **\"Belt and Road\" vs. \"Belt and Road Initiative\":** Omitting \"Initiative\" (as in translations 2, 4, 6) risks ambiguity, as the term \"Belt and Road\" alone is vague without context.  \n3. **Verb Choice:** \"Co-organized\" (translation 6) is less precise than \"co-hosted,\" which directly reflects the original Chinese term \"合辦.\"  \n4. **Title Formatting:** Using \"titled\" (translations 1, 5) is more formal and precise than \"the seminar\" (translations 2–4).  \nThe best translation integrates the correct organization name, includes \"Initiative\" for clarity, and uses \"co-hosted a seminar titled\" for grammatical precision and formality.\n\n# May 29\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Invest Hong Kong jointly held a seminar in Guangzhou themed \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area • New Opportunities for Overseas Asset Management.\"\n\n#June14th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the International Capital Market Association co-hosted the 2018 \"Green and Social Responsibility Bond Principles\" Annual Members' Meeting and Conference in Hong Kong.\n\n# June 15\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Research Bureau of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) co-hosted the \"Seminar on Green Finance Cooperation between Mainland China and Hong Kong\" in Hong Kong.\n\n# June 25th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Shenzhen Municipal Government's Financial Development Service Office have launched the first-ever \"Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Program\" for Hong Kong university students.\n\n# June 26\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) signed a Cooperation Agreement to strengthen fintech collaboration between the two entities.\n\n# June 27th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission have published a joint consultation summary on further improvements to the regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives.\n\n#June 28th\n\nIFFO hosted a panel discussion on \"Risk Mitigation in Infrastructure Investment and Financing\" during the 3rd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.\nThe original text specifies the event as the \"3rd Belt and Road Summit Forum,\" but the most accurate and widely recognized official name of the event is the \"Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.\" While \"Summit\" is sometimes used colloquially, the formal designation avoids redundancy. The term \"hosted\" is appropriate for \"主持,\" though \"chaired\" could also work depending on context. All translations correctly capture the core meaning, but the most precise event name and standard terminology (\"Risk Mitigation\") yield the clearest, most professional result.\n\n# July 3rd\n\nBond Connect Marks Its First Anniversary.  \nThe original text, 「債券通」開通一周年, is a concise headline announcing the one-year anniversary of the Bond Connect initiative. The junior translations vary in accuracy, formality, and naturalness.  \n**Key observations:**  \n1. **Terminology:** All translations correctly use \"Bond Connect\" (except the fourth, which erroneously uses \"Bond Channel\").  \n2. **Verb Choice:** The third and fifth translations use \"marks\" (active voice), which is more dynamic than \"has been operational\" (passive voice) in the first and sixth translations.  \n3. **Conciseness:** The fifth translation (\"Bond Connect marks its first anniversary\") is the most concise and natural, avoiding unnecessary words like \"The\" or \"One-Year.\"  \n4. **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"First anniversary\" is a standard English expression, while \"one-year anniversary\" is also acceptable but slightly less idiomatic.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Retain \"Bond Connect\" as the official term.  \n- Use active voice (\"marks\") for engagement.  \n- Opt for \"first anniversary\" for natural phrasing.  \n- Avoid redundant prepositions or articles (e.g., \"The\" or \"of the launch\").  \n**Final Translation:**  \nBond Connect Marks Its First Anniversary.\n\n# July 18th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority released the \"Open Application Programming Interface\" (Open API) framework for Hong Kong's banking industry.\n\n# August 7th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" initiative in collaboration with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions.\n\n#August 15-16\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council co-hosted a high-level roundtable meeting in Hong Kong titled \"Linking the Belt and Road Initiative, Expanding Development Opportunities Together.\"\n\n# August 24th\n\nThe \"Bond Connect\" scheme has fully implemented the real-time delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement model.\n\n# August 31st\n\nThe original text is a formal legal statement. All translations correctly identify the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the relevant ordinance. However, there are minor but significant differences in formality and precision. The first translation uses the abbreviation \"HKMA,\" which is acceptable but less formal than the full name. The fifth translation uses \"Cap. 584\" (a common legal abbreviation in Hong Kong) instead of \"Chapter 584,\" which is more precise. The sixth translation uses the simple past tense \"designated\" rather than the present perfect \"has designated,\" which better matches the original's past-tense verb. The other translations are accurate but lack these refinements. To optimize the translation, the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" should be used for clarity, the simple past tense \"designated\" for grammatical accuracy, and \"Cap. 584\" for legal precision.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority designated two retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 584).\n\n# September 9th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Central Bank of Brazil signed a Cooperation Agreement to promote collaboration between the two central banks in financial technology matters.\n\n# September 17th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS). The system became fully operational on September 30.\n\n# September 20th\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the People's Bank of China signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the use of the Debt Instrument Central Settlement System for issuing People's Bank of China bills.\n\n# September 21st\n\nThe \"2018 Capital Markets Summit,\" co-organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks, was held in Hong Kong.\n\n# October 25-26\n\nIFFO hosted the 2nd \"Investor and Debt Financing Roundtable Meeting\" and announced the addition of five new institutions as partners, bringing the total number of partners to 95.\n\n# October 31st\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the official launch of \"TradeLink,\" a blockchain-based trade financing platform jointly developed by a consortium of 12 major Hong Kong banks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the operators of the TradeLink platform and the European we.trade platform, to launch a new proof-of-concept project connecting the two platforms.\n\n#October31toNovember15\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is providing on-site arrangements for the mutual evaluation jointly conducted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) of Hong Kong.

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","en":"# Introduction to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is Hong Kong's central banking institution, with four main functions: maintaining monetary stability within the framework of the linked exchange rate system; promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); assisting in consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international financial center, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure; and managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Statutory Authority of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nThe Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary to appoint the Financial Management Commissioner. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Management Commissioner are explicitly stipulated in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters dated June 25, 2003, between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management Commissioner outlines the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters, and also discloses that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Financial Management Commissioner. This letter is a public document and can be accessed on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund must primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner, appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, assists the Financial Secretary in executing the functions conferred upon him under the Ordinance, as well as other functions assigned by the Financial Secretary under other ordinances. The office of the Financial Management Commissioner is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Financial Management Commissioner is the Governor of the HKMA.\n\nThe Financial Services and Treasury Bureau exercises regulatory and supervisory functions over banking operations and deposit-taking activities in accordance with the Banking Ordinance. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Commissioner of Banking is responsible for the approval of licensed banks, banks with restricted licenses, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance designates the Financial Management Commissioner as the resolution authority for banking entities. The Ordinance grants the Financial Management Commissioner a range of powers to carry out orderly resolution of the relevant entities, thereby reducing the risks that the entities’ unsustainable operations may pose to the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong’s financial system.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance grant the Financial Services Commissioner certain powers relating to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund schemes.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance stipulates that the power to inspect and investigate a bank's insurance business may be delegated to the Financial Management Commissioner.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Financial Services Commissioner to oversee banks' compliance with the Ordinance's provisions.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance empowers the Financial Secretary to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation to depositors of insolvent banks from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the Financial Management Commissioner may designate and supervise settlement and clearing systems critical to the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system, or to Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also authorizes the Financial Management Commissioner to administer the licensing regime for stored value facilities, designate retail payment systems, and supervise the safety and efficiency of their operations.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, but it may employ staff under terms of employment different from those of civil servants to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA's Chief Executive and its staff are public officials. The HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations within the statutory powers conferred upon or delegated to the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Financial Management Commissioner, the Financial Secretary specified that currency stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Financial Management Commissioner is independently responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving its status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the duties of the Commissioner for Financial Services include:  \n- Promoting the overall stability and effective functioning of the banking system  \n- Collaborating with relevant institutions and organizations to develop debt markets  \n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins  \n- Enhancing the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing, and settlement systems, and operating such systems where appropriate  \n- Working with relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer must be accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, acting under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and the methods it employs to implement government policy objectives, while also ensuring a high level of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and supervising a sound and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and promoting economic development.\n\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must secure the public’s trust. Therefore, it adopts a rigorous approach to fulfilling its duty of explaining its policies and operations to the public, and strives to address matters of public concern that fall within its purview.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through both the Financial Secretary and the Legislative Council. The Financial Management Commissioner is appointed by the Financial Secretary, establishing the HKMA’s accountability via this channel. Additionally, as the HKMA’s authority derives from legislation enacted by the Legislative Council, it is also accountable to the public through that body. Beyond these formal responsibilities, the HKMA recognizes its broader obligation to foster public understanding of its role and objectives while closely monitoring societal concerns. In executing its daily operations and maintaining engagement with the community, the HKMA adheres to a policy of maximizing transparency and maintaining openness. This policy encompasses two key objectives:  \n- To ensure the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA’s work, while respecting statutory restrictions on disclosing market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data;  \n- To ensure the HKMA remains attuned to societal trends and appropriately responds to public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, it publishes a variety of bilingual (Chinese and English) journals and special publications. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents issued by the HKMA. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to enhance communication with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an information centre, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, offering lectures and guided tours of the information centre to explain the HKMA’s functions to the public, particularly students, and to enhance citizens’ financial literacy. Detailed information on the HKMA’s media engagement, publications, and public education activities can be found in the “Institutional Functions” chapter.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively increased both the frequency and detail of its disclosures regarding the Exchange Fund and the Currency Issuance Department's accounts. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) program for central banks in 1999. It also publishes meeting records of the Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Issuance Department system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has also featured banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council (LegCo) is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the LegCo Financial Affairs Committee on the HKMA’s operations and policies three times a year and answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives will occasionally attend meetings of the LegCo Financial Affairs Committee and Bills Committee to explain and discuss specific matters, as well as assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Advisory Committees and Other Committees\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original term \"外匯基金諮詢委員會\" translates to \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\" Among the junior translations, several key issues arise:  \n1. **Terminology Precision:** \"Exchange Fund\" (as in translations 1, 2, 5, 6) is less precise than \"Foreign Exchange Fund\" (translations 3, 5), which accurately reflects \"外匯\" (foreign exchange).  \n2. **Cultural\/Contextual Specificity:** Translation 4 adds \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" which may be contextually accurate in some cases but is not explicitly stated in the original text, risking over-specification.  \n3. **Formatting:** Translation 6 omits spacing and uses all caps, violating standard English title formatting.  \n4. **Hashtag Usage:** The original includes a hashtag (#), which should be preserved in the translation to maintain structural consistency.  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Retain \"Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\" for accuracy.  \n- Include the hashtag (#) as in translation 2.  \n- Avoid unnecessary additions (e.g., \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\") unless explicitly required by context.  \n- Ensure proper spacing and capitalization.  \n**Final Translation:**  \n# Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nThe Financial Secretary exercises control over the Exchange Fund and consults the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in doing so. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This provision stipulates that the Financial Secretary must consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, while other members (including the Commissioner for Financial Management) are appointed in their personal capacities by the Financial Secretary under the authority of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed for their respective professional expertise and experience, which greatly benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. Their expertise and experience cover areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, commerce, and law.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established five specialized committees to oversee specific aspects of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's operations and to report and make recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. In 2018, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee held five meetings to discuss various matters related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, with most of these matters having been previously discussed by the relevant specialized committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and provides recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters relating to the HKMA’s remuneration and service conditions, human resources policies, financial budget, and administrative and governance affairs. In 2018, the Committee held five meetings, covering topics including the HKMA’s expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual remuneration review, and strategic planning. The Committee also reviewed the HKMA’s regularly submitted work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) financial reporting procedures and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal control systems, submitting reports as required. It is responsible for examining the HKMA's financial statements, the components of those statements, and the accounting principles used in their preparation, and for reviewing the audit scope and results in collaboration with external and internal auditors. Members of the Audit Committee do not hold any administrative positions within the HKMA. In 2018, the Committee held two meetings and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Currency Board oversees the operation of the Exchange Fund Arrangement and reports on its role as a pillar of Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system. The Board is responsible for ensuring the Exchange Fund Arrangement operates in accordance with established policies, proposing improvements to the system, and ensuring its operations maintain a high level of transparency.

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2018年香港經濟持續擴張，不過隨着金融狀況收緊及貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，增長動力於年內有所減弱。隨着全球經濟增長轉弱，預期2019年香港經濟增長亦會減慢。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟進一步擴張，不過按年增長速度由第1季的4.6%，逐步減慢至第4季的1.3%（表1），並拖累全年增長率由2017年的3.8%下降至3.0%。經濟擴張轉弱，反映本地需求增長減慢以及經濟持續受淨出口所拖累（圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在第1季強勁增長，但其後增長動力減弱，部分反映貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，以及本地資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應。由於營商信心脆弱，整體投資支出的增長速度亦放緩。外圍方面，貨品出口於首3季大致保持平穩，但在第4季隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇而顯著轉差。貨品進口亦因為出口帶動的需求轉弱而放緩。相比之下，服務輸出錄得較快的全年增長，部分是受惠於訪港旅遊業表現蓬勃，而服務輸入則由於運輸、商業及其他服務增長而得以大致維持增長動力。按淨額計，貿易差額由2017年的順差轉為2018年的小幅逆差，並拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n表1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n主要受到港元與美元負息差下的套息活動所影響，港元兌美元匯率在2018年大致回軟。尤其弱方兌換保證在4月、5月及8月被觸發，促使金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）所定，在7.85港元兌1美元的水平，向銀行購入港元及沽出美元。按照聯匯制度的設計，港元貨幣基礎因而收縮，表示銀行同業流動性減少，再加上市場預期美國加息，導致港元銀行同業拆息整體上升。由於銀行體系資金成本上升，銀行於9月下旬在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。信貸增長方面，部分由於本地經濟增長放緩以及對外貿易表現轉弱，整體銀行貸款的增幅由2017年的16.1%，顯著減慢至2018年的4.4%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力於2018年略為增加。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2017年的1.7%低位，升至2018年的2.6%，不過仍屬於溫和水平。當中的住屋租金組成項目增幅較快，反映較早前新簽訂私人住宅租金上升的影響（圖2）。更廣泛的分析顯示，名義勞工成本及商用物業租金增長略為加快，令本地成本壓力更趨明顯。隨着香港部分主要進口來源地通脹上升，進口價格通脹亦因而攀升。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2018年保持穩健（圖3）。失業率由2017年全年的3.1%下降至2018年的2.8%，是自1997年以來的最低水平。當中大部分主要服務行業的失業率都有所回落，特別是住宿及膳食服務業的跌幅更為顯著。隨着總就業人數及私營機構職位空缺進一步增加，整體勞工需求持續增強，而且勞動人口參與率亦輕微上升。在勞工市場狀況趨緊下，實質工資及收入進一步增加。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市走勢在2018年大幅逆轉。恒生指數在2017年強勁的上升動力帶動下，於2018年1月升上33,484點的歷史高位（圖4）。然而，隨着主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策、中美貿易摩擦加劇及本地經濟增長放緩引起投資者的憂慮，市場的樂觀情緒急劇逆轉。恒生指數在10月下挫至24,586點的低位，在年底則收報25,846點，較一年前下跌13.6%。然而，平均每日成交額則由2017年的882億港元上升至1,074億港元，本港首次公開招股集資總額亦因數間從事新興及創科產業的企業上市而大幅增加。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2018年上半年保持暢旺，不過在下半年隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇、環球股市調整及本港最優惠利率上升而有所降溫。整體樓價在7月至12月期間由高位回落9%，然而全年計仍錄得2%的升幅（圖4）。由於一手及二手市場的買賣活動於下半年顯著減少，所以物業成交量在2018年亦較前一年下跌7%至57,247宗。此外，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率以及收入槓桿比率分別為17.0及75.7，兩者均遠高於長期平均水平。另一方面，非住宅物業價格在2018年整體上升，惟接近年底時稍見回落。全年計，價格及租金均進一步上升，租金回報率則維持在低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n由於全球經濟增長放緩，預期2019年香港經濟增長將會減慢。尤其外圍環境充滿挑戰，預期香港出口表現仍會受壓。本地方面，雖然失業率低企及家庭收入增加將繼續支撐私人消費，但部分由於消費信心減弱及較早前的資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應的影響，預期私人消費增長步伐會放緩。固定資本形成方面，雖然隨着房屋供應增加，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但面對經濟不明朗因素增加，企業對於資本投資可能會變得更為審慎。政府預測2019年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員的最新預測增幅則平均為2.3%。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n由於包括香港在內的全球增長放緩，外圍物價及本地成本壓力或會得到紓緩，因此預期通脹壓力在2019年仍保持溫和。近期新簽訂住宅租金回落，亦會對通脹產生壓抑作用。市場共識預測2019年整體通脹率為2.2%，政府預期基本通脹率則為2.5%。預期在經濟持續增長及訪港旅遊業維持暢旺下，勞工市場狀況會繼續偏緊。私營機構分析員預計失業率於2019年會維持於約3%的水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2019年經濟前景受貿易摩擦、美國貨幣政策未來方向、內地經濟表現、英國脫歐及其他地緣政治局勢等不明朗因素及風險所影響。另外，一旦上述的不明朗因素加劇並長期持續，金融市場情緒及營商信心或會大受影響，對本地資產市場及實體經濟活動構成下行壓力。\n\n另外，住宅物業市場受眾多外圍及本地因素所影響，其前景並不明朗。外圍方面，中美貿易摩擦的不確定性將有可能影響市場情緒、經濟前景及金融狀況，使香港物業市場前景繼續蒙上陰影。本地方面，雖然經濟增長放緩，但就業情況及收入增長仍大致穩定，或可支持住宅物業需求。本港利率的走勢某程度上視乎美國未來的政策利率變動，惟後者走勢並不明確。長遠而言，由於過去幾年住宅落成量有所增加，加上政府致力增加土地及房屋供應，預期房屋供求缺口或會收窄。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管外圍不利因素增加，例如中美貿易衝突、英國脫歐及利率正常化，令金融市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2018年仍然穩健。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況穩健，資產質素保持良好。利率趨升令息差擴闊，刺激銀行盈利顯著增加。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2018年銀行體系繼續穩步增長，資產負債表擴大5.9%。面對經濟不明朗因素持續，例如主要經濟體之間的貿易衝突及加息等，企業在獲取新貸款方面變得較為保守。年內貸款總額增幅放緩至4.4%，而2017年為16.1%。有關增長受在香港使用的貸款（+6.5%）及在香港境外使用的貸款（+2%）同告增加帶動。另一方面，由於環球貿易環境不明朗，貿易融資下跌7.6%。中國內地相關貸款的增長亦由2017年的17.5%放緩至2018年的1.4%。\n\n銀行體系持有的債務證券總額在2018年底繼續佔總資產的22%，與2017年一樣。由於這些債務證券大部分為政府及銀行發行的投資級別債務證券，因此有關信用風險維持在低水平。\n\n就負債方而言，存款總額在2018年增加5%，較2017年（+8.7%）的增幅小。由於預期美國持續加息，部分銀行上調定期存款利率，吸引存戶將往來及儲蓄存款轉為定期存款，從而鎖定資金。往來及儲蓄存款佔存款總額的比例由對上一年的57.4%，降至2018年底的51.4%，導致資金成本上升。由於存款總額的增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2017年底的73%稍降至2018年底的72.6%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系資本相當充裕，表示其具備強大緩衝以抵禦潛在衝擊。資本比率處於自實施《巴塞爾協定三》以來的歷史高位；本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率由2017年底的19.1%，增加至2018年底的20.3%（圖6）。\n\n圖6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2018年1月1日生效；該比率是一項非風險為本規定，旨在限制銀行體系過度累積槓桿。於2018年底，槓桿比率為8.0%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n圖7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，反映其具備強大能力，可有效承受來自潛在金融及經濟壓力的衝擊。短期流動性（涵蓋1個月期資金）方面，第1類機構的平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為167.6%，遠高於2018年適用的90%法定最低要求。第2類機構的平均流動性維持比率為54.3%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖8）。\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nHong Kong's economy continued to expand in 2018, although growth momentum weakened during the year as tightening financial conditions and rising trade protectionism increased uncertainty. With global economic growth slowing, Hong Kong's economic growth is also expected to decelerate in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy continued to expand in 2018, although the year-on-year growth rate gradually slowed from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected a slowdown in domestic demand growth and continued drag from net exports (Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter but subsequently lost momentum, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and the wealth effect from local asset price adjustments. Overall investment expenditure also slowed due to fragile business confidence. Externally, goods exports remained largely stable in the first three quarters but deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. Goods imports also slowed due to weaker export-driven demand. In contrast, service exports recorded faster annual growth, partly benefiting from robust performance in the tourism sector, while service imports maintained growth momentum largely due to expansion in transportation, business, and other services. On a net basis, the trade balance turned from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, weighing on local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly changes in total fixed capital formation are not available.  \nData source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Monetary Conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate against the US dollar weakened in 2018, primarily driven by carry trade activities stemming from the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. The Weak-Side Convertibility Guarantee was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at the rate of 7.85 HKD to 1 USD, as stipulated by the Linked Exchange Rate System (LETS). According to the design of the LETS, this intervention caused the Hong Kong dollar's monetary base to contract, signaling reduced interbank liquidity. Combined with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, the overall Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) rose. As banking system funding costs increased, banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points in late September following the upward adjustment of the US Federal Funds rate target range. In terms of credit growth, the overall increase in bank loans slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018, partly due to a slowdown in local economic growth and weaker external trade performance.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures rose slightly in 2018. Excluding the impact of one-time government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate increased from 1.7%, a low level in 2017, to 2.6% in 2018, though it remained at a modest level. The component for housing rentals increased at a faster pace, reflecting the impact of earlier rises in newly signed private residential leases (Figure 2). Broader analysis showed that growth in nominal labor costs and commercial property rents had slightly accelerated, making local cost pressures more pronounced. Meanwhile, import price inflation also rose as inflation increased in some of Hong Kong's major import source countries.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market remained strong in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate decreased from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. Unemployment rates declined in most major service sectors, with particularly significant decreases in the accommodation and food services industry. With further increases in total employment and private sector job vacancies, overall labor demand continued to strengthen, and the labor force participation rate also rose slightly. Amidst a tightening labor market, real wages and incomes increased further.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n#StockMarket\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a significant reversal in 2018. Driven by robust upward momentum in 2017, the Hang Seng Index reached a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, as major central banks tightened monetary policies, US-China trade tensions escalated, and concerns mounted over slowing local economic growth, market optimism quickly reversed. The Hang Seng Index plummeted to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed the year at 25,846 points, a 13.6% decline from the previous year. Nevertheless, average daily turnover increased from HK$88.2 billion in 2017 to HK$107.4 billion, while the total funds raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong also rose significantly due to the listings of several companies in emerging and technology-driven industries.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices  \nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate and fluent, with minor variations in terminology and phrasing. Key strengths include consistent use of financial terminology (e.g., \"price-to-income ratio,\" \"prime rate\") and adherence to the original structure. However, weaknesses include inconsistent use of terms like \"prime rates\" vs. \"most favorable interest rate\" (the former is standard in financial contexts), and occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., \"retreated 9%\" vs. \"fell by 9%\"). The use of \"cases\" or \"units\" for \"宗\" is less natural than \"transactions.\" Additionally, some translations use \"rental yields\" (plural) where the original specifies a singular \"租金回報率\" (rental yield). The best translation would standardize terminology, ensure natural phrasing, and maintain consistency in tense and numerical expressions.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe residential property market remained robust in the first half of 2018 but cooled in the second half amid escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions, global stock market adjustments, and rising Hong Kong prime lending rates. Overall property prices fell by 9% from their peak between July and December, although they still recorded a 2% increase for the year (Figure 4). Property transaction volumes in 2018 dropped by 7% compared to the previous year, totaling 57,247 transactions, due to significantly reduced buying and selling activity in both new and second-hand markets. Housing affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and income leverage ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both far above long-term averages. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, though they slightly declined toward the end of the year. For the full year, prices and rents continued to increase, while rental yield remained at low levels.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nDue to the slowdown in global economic growth, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to decelerate in 2019. The external environment is fraught with challenges, and Hong Kong's export performance is likely to remain under pressure. Domestically, while the low unemployment rate and rising household incomes will continue to support private consumption, the pace of growth in private consumption is expected to slow, partly due to weakening consumer confidence and the wealth-reducing effects of earlier asset price adjustments. Regarding fixed capital formation, although increased housing supply should lead to steady growth in construction and property activities, businesses may become more cautious about capital investment in the face of heightened economic uncertainty. The government forecasts Hong Kong's real GDP growth rate for 2019 to range between 2% and 3%, while the latest average projections from private sector analysts stand at 2.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nDue to the global growth slowdown, including Hong Kong, external price pressures and local cost pressures are expected to ease, leading to moderate inflationary pressures in 2019. Recent declines in newly signed residential rental contracts will also exert downward pressure on inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 2.2% for 2019, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.5%. With sustained economic growth and a robust tourism sector, labor market conditions are anticipated to remain tight. Private sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will stay around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertain Factors and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2019 is affected by uncertainties and risks such as trade tensions, the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, China's economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical developments. Furthermore, should these uncertainties intensify and persist in the long term, they could significantly impact financial market sentiment and business confidence, exerting downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activity.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is influenced by numerous external and local factors, and its outlook remains uncertain. Externally, the uncertainty surrounding Sino-U.S. trade tensions could impact market sentiment, economic prospects, and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over the Hong Kong property market. Locally, although economic growth has slowed, employment and income growth remain relatively stable, which may support residential property demand. The direction of interest rates in Hong Kong to some extent depends on future changes in U.S. policy rates, though the latter's trajectory remains unclear. In the long term, due to the increase in residential completions in recent years, combined with the government's efforts to boost land and housing supply, the housing supply and demand gap is expected to narrow.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite rising external challenges such as the US-China trade conflict, Brexit, and interest rate normalization, which heightened financial market volatility, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2018. The system maintained strong capital and liquidity positions, with asset quality remaining solid. Rising interest rates widened net interest margins, leading to a significant increase in bank profitability.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nIn 2018, the banking system continued its steady growth, with the balance sheet expanding by 5.9%. Facing ongoing economic uncertainties, such as trade tensions between major economies and interest rate hikes, businesses became more cautious in obtaining new loans. The total loan growth for the year slowed to 4.4%, down from 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans used within Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, trade financing declined by 7.6% due to the uncertain global trade environment. Growth in loans related to Mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system continued to account for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. Since most of these debt securities were investment-grade debt securities issued by governments and banks, the associated credit risk remained at a low level.\n\nFrom the liability side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller growth rate than the 8.7% recorded in 2017. Anticipating continued U.S. interest rate hikes, some banks raised fixed deposit rates to encourage depositors to convert current and savings deposits into fixed deposits, thereby locking in funds. The proportion of current and savings deposits in total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% by the end of 2018, leading to higher funding costs. As total deposit growth outpaced loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% by the end of 2018 (Figure 5).  \nFrom the liability side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller growth rate than the 8.7% recorded in 2017. Anticipating continued U.S. interest rate hikes, some banks raised fixed deposit rates to encourage depositors to convert current and savings deposits into fixed deposits, thereby locking in funds. The proportion of current and savings deposits in total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% by the end of 2018, leading to higher funding costs. As total deposit growth outpaced loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% by the end of 2018 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy Ratio\n\nThe banking sector maintains ample capital, indicating a strong capacity to absorb potential shocks. Capital adequacy ratios are at historical highs since the implementation of Basel III; the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions rose from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Composite Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered and Recognized Institutions\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio took effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based requirement aimed at limiting excessive leverage accumulation within the banking system. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio stood at 8.0%, significantly higher than the 3% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Recognized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust, reflecting its strong capacity to effectively withstand potential financial and economic pressures. In terms of short-term liquidity (covering one-month funding), the average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the 90% statutory minimum requirement applicable in 2018. The average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also significantly higher than the 25% statutory minimum requirement (Figure 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","en":"#Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong dollar interest rates generally rose, while the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate weakened and approached the level of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee. Despite this, the foreign exchange and money markets in Hong Kong continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand significant shocks.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, ensuring the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable within a band of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This system operates under a currency board arrangement, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base. Any changes to the monetary base must be matched by corresponding adjustments in the US dollar reserves, maintaining a 100% alignment with fluctuations in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises:  \n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)  \n- Currency in circulation issued by the Government, including banknotes and coins  \n- The total balance of clearing accounts held by banks with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance)  \n- Foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe junior translations exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology:** \"Certificates of liabilities\" (Translation 2) and \"Promissory notes\" (Translation 3) misrepresent 負債證明書, which should be \"Certificates of indebtedness\" (used in Translations 1, 6). \"Certificates of Deposit\" (Translation 5) is entirely incorrect.  \n2. **Fluency:** \"Circulating paper money\" (Translation 2) is less precise than \"currency in circulation\" (Translation 6), which better reflects 紙幣及硬幣. \"Aggregate balance\" (Translation 3) is unnecessarily vague compared to the explicit \"total balance\" in the original.  \n3. **Cultural\/Contextual Accuracy:** \"Financial Regulator\" (Translation 5) incorrectly substitutes 金管局 (Hong Kong Monetary Authority). \"Clearing accounts\" (Translation 6) is more precise than \"settlement accounts\" for 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口.  \n4. **Consistency:** Translations 1, 6, and 4 correctly use \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" while others use inconsistent abbreviations (e.g., \"HKMA\" vs. \"Monetary Authority\").  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Use \"Certificates of indebtedness\" for 負債證明書.  \n- Replace \"circulating paper currency\" with \"currency in circulation\" for clarity.  \n- Specify \"banknotes and coins\" to match 紙幣及硬幣.  \n- Use \"total balance\" instead of \"aggregate balance\" to align with 總結餘.  \n- Maintain \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" for consistency and clarity.  \n- Opt for \"notes and bonds\" over \"instruments\" to preserve specificity in 外匯基金票據及債券.  \nThe final translation above integrates these refinements, ensuring technical accuracy, fluency, and alignment with the original text's intent.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange rate guarantee. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the exchange rate band of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of the Hong Kong dollar, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing total reserves and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thus bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the exchange rate band.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAgainst the backdrop of widening negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which spurred carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee, which had been set at the 7.85 level since 2005, was triggered for the first time. Throughout the year, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered a total of 27 times in 2018, with 13 triggers in April, 6 in May, and 8 in August. Nevertheless, Hong Kong dollar transactions remained smooth and orderly, with the exchange rate hovering around the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.85 from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened, partly reflecting the tightening of interbank liquidity as holidays, quarter-end, and year-end approached, which led to the unwinding of some carry trade positions. At the same time, the Hong Kong dollar was also supported to some extent by improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rate\n\nDue to the activation of the weak-side exchange guarantee, the total balance and the aggregate amount of outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds decreased from HK$122.68 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$113.62 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchased a total of HK$103.5 billion at the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 in response to banks’ requests, in accordance with the design of the linked exchange rate system. As a result, the total balance fell from HK$17.98 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$7.64 billion at the end of 2018. The aggregate amount of outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds remained largely unchanged during the year. The monetary base continued to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds amounted to HK$1.1362 trillion.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original text specifies a total of 11,362億港元 (11,362 x 100 million = 1.1362 trillion HKD). Translators 1, 3, and 6 correctly converted this to \"113.62 billion\" or \"1.1362 trillion,\" while translators 2 and 5 made critical numerical errors (11,362 billion = 11.362 trillion; 113,620 billion = 113.62 trillion). Translator 6’s use of \"1.1362 trillion\" is precise and avoids ambiguity.  \nTerminology: \"外匯基金票據及債券\" should be \"Exchange Fund bills and bonds\" (translators 1, 4, 6) or \"foreign exchange fund notes and bonds\" (translators 3, 4). \"Notes\" is acceptable for \"票據\" but \"bills\" is more standard in financial contexts. Translator 4 added \"issued by the Exchange Fund,\" which is redundant unless the original implies ownership, which it does not.  \nFluency: Translator 1’s \"the balance totaled\" is awkward; \"the total outstanding amount\" (translators 3, 6) is clearer. Translator 6’s phrasing (\"total outstanding amount... amounted to\") is concise and natural.  \nCultural Appropriateness: HKD should be written as \"HK$1.1362 trillion\" (translator 6) or \"HK$113.62 billion\" (translators 1, 3). Using \"trillion\" avoids confusion with the original’s \"億\" (100 million).  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nAt the end of 2018, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds amounted to HK$1.1362 trillion.\n\nFigure 2: Summary of End-of-Year Balances and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds (2018)\n\n# Money Market\n\nDue to reduced interbank liquidity following the triggering of the weak-side exchange guarantee and market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally rose throughout 2018. Short-term HIBOR experienced greater volatility (Figure 3), driven by increased funding demand related to new equity fundraising activities and seasonal liquidity needs. Overall, short-term HIBOR remained largely below the basic interest rate level during 2018. In response to rising funding costs within the banking system, banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the upward adjustment of the U.S. federal funds rate target range in late September.\n\nThe original text details adjustments to the basic interest rate in response to U.S. Federal Funds rate hikes, emphasizing procedural accuracy and clarity. The junior translations vary in fluency and precision. Key issues include:  \n1. **Ambiguity in rate ranges**: Some translations misplace or obscure the original-to-new U.S. rate range (1.25–1.50% to 2.25–2.50%), creating confusion.  \n2. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"average of the 5-day moving average\" are repetitive and should be streamlined.  \n3. **Terminology**: \"Lower bound\" vs. \"lower limit\" and \"HIBOR\" formatting (e.g., \"Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR)\") require consistency.  \n4. **Flow**: Some translations lack smooth transitions between the rate hikes and the formula explanation.  \nImprovements should clarify the U.S. rate progression, eliminate redundancy, standardize terminology, and ensure logical flow.  \n**Improved Translation**:  \nIn response to four rate hikes totaling 100 basis points in the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range this year, which was raised from 1.25% to 1.50% to 2.25% to 2.50%, the basic interest rate was increased by a cumulative 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, moving from 1.75% to 2.75%. These adjustments followed the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. Under this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the higher of two values: (1) the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range plus 50 basis points, or (2) the average of the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR).\n\nFigure 3: 2018 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR)\n\nThe discounts on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate widened in the first four months, largely tracking the movement of the Hong Kong dollar–U.S. dollar interest rate differential. The 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reached a low of negative 620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar narrowed, the discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate slightly decreased before widening again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 10.3 billion in 2017 to HKD 40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4: 2018 USD\/HKD Forward Exchange Rate Points  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe original text specifies a financial figure (圖4) with a year (2018年), currency pair (美元兌港元), and the term \"遠期匯率點子\" (forward exchange rate points). Key considerations include:  \n1. **Currency Notation:** \"USD\/HKD\" is standard in finance, while \"USD to HKD\" is less concise.  \n2. **Term Accuracy:** \"Points\" (點子) refers to units of exchange rate fluctuation, not \"quotes\" or \"rates.\"  \n3. **Clarity vs. Verbosity:** Full names (e.g., \"US Dollar against Hong Kong Dollar\") are clearer but unnecessary for technical contexts.  \n4. **Cultural Appropriateness:** Financial terminology must align with industry norms (e.g., \"forward exchange rate points\" is precise).  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Retain \"USD\/HKD\" for brevity and standardization.  \n- Use \"Forward Exchange Rate Points\" to explicitly capture \"遠期匯率點子.\"  \n- Place the year directly after \"Figure 4\" for consistency with academic\/technical formatting.  \n**Final Translation:**  \nFigure 4: 2018 USD\/HKD Forward Exchange Rate Points\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe linked exchange rate system, implemented since 1983, has consistently served as a vital cornerstone for maintaining Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. It has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience in withstanding significant shocks during multiple regional and global financial crises. The weak-side exchange guarantee, an integral component of the system, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August due to the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar. Capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar represent an inevitable phase in the normalization of interest rates and constitute normal operations under the linked exchange rate system. To enhance public understanding of these mechanisms and the technical intricacies of the system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has actively explained its details to the public, showcasing the resilience of Hong Kong's financial system in responding to shocks. The government remains resolute in its commitment to maintaining the linked exchange rate system. The stability of foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces public confidence in the government's dedication and in the Hong Kong dollar's role as a medium of payment and store of value. During its 2018 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the linked exchange rate system, emphasizing that it remains the most suitable monetary framework for Hong Kong—a pillar of stability that ensures sustained economic growth, maintains competitiveness, and facilitates the smooth operation of the city's extensive financial services sector.\n\nGiven that a sound banking system is crucial for the smooth functioning of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. It also maintains oversight of banks' corporate, property-related, and Mainland China-related lending to ensure the banking system's resilience to shocks. Banks hold substantial amounts of Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds, which can be used through the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate fluctuations. The HKMA is prepared at all times to provide additional liquidity by adjusting the issuance of Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds to address potential sharp outflows of Hong Kong dollar funds. The HKMA also reminds the public to prudently manage market and interest rate risks and to prepare for possible market turbulence.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 109.9% as of December 31 (Figure 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources provide a strong backing to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Changes in the Support Ratio in 2018\n\n# Currency Issuance Committee\n\nThe Currency Board, operating under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2018, the Currency Board addressed topics including the potential impact of multiple central banks jointly exiting unconventional monetary policies on the supply of U.S. dollar loans by foreign banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of demand for Hong Kong dollars, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System since the implementation of three optimization measures. Meeting minutes of the Currency Board and the Currency Board System Operation Reports submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Financial Research (HKIFR) continues to support research in monetary policy, banking, and the financial sector. Over the past four years, the HKIFR has placed greater emphasis on policy-related research, a focus particularly evident in the seminars it has organized and its visiting scholar program. Firstly, the HKIFR collaborates with major central banks and policy research institutions to co-host more policy-related seminars. Secondly, in 2016, it launched the Special Research Scholar Program to support more research projects related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) policy-making.\n\nIn 2018, the research center invited a total of 16 scholars for visits and published 25 research papers. Throughout the year, the center also hosted four international conferences:  \n- The \"9th Annual International Conference on China's Economy,\" held in January, with the theme \"China's Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.\" Co-organized by the research center, the Market Economy Research Institute of the State Council Development Research Center, and the Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China, the conference focused on topics and risks related to China's real estate market.  \n- The \"Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Framework\" conference, held in October and co-organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). This event was part of the celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the BIS's Asia-Pacific Office in Hong Kong, aiming to explore the role of exchange rates within monetary policy frameworks.  \n- The \"2018 Annual Conference on Central Bank Financial Market Microstructure,\" held in November. The conference discussed theoretical research, empirical findings, and policy implications related to recent developments in financial market microstructure.  \n- The \"China Experts Network Seminar on China's New Era,\" held in November and co-organized by the HKMA, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\n\nDespite increasing uncertainties in the global economy and financial markets, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2018. The effectiveness of liquidity and credit risk management systems at authorized institutions continued to be a key regulatory focus for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) throughout the year. In light of the ongoing rise in cyber threats and the broader adoption of financial technology in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its regulatory oversight of authorized institutions' technology risk management and business continuity capabilities. In May, the HKMA issued a revised version of the \"Guidelines on the Authorization of Virtual Banks\" and began processing applications for virtual bank authorization. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA took further measures to enhance oversight of authorized institutions' practices in selling investment and insurance products, promote accessible banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly complex and globalized, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to leverage new technologies and a risk-based approach to enhance Hong Kong’s capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA has made commendable progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and limits on large risk exposures. In addition, the HKMA has strengthened its communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.  \n**Reasoning:**  \nThe translations collectively demonstrate strong technical accuracy, with minor variations in phrasing and tone. Key improvements include:  \n1. **Consistency in nomenclature:** Using \"HKMA\" consistently (as in Translation 6) avoids ambiguity.  \n2. **Tone and precision:** \"Commendable progress\" (Translation 6) better reflects the original’s positive tone than \"good\" or \"satisfactory.\"  \n3. **Conciseness:** Removing redundancy (e.g., \"communication and engagement\" → \"communication\" in Translation 4) improves fluency.  \n4. **Terminology:** \"Limits on large risk exposures\" (Translations 2, 4, 6) is more precise than \"large exposure limits.\"  \n5. **Structural flow:** Maintaining the original’s logical sequence (technological measures → regulatory standards → sector communication) ensures clarity.  \nThe final translation integrates these elements for natural, professional English while preserving the original’s intent and nuance.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to ensure that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including the introduction of rules specifying minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to address a major obstacle to the feasibility of resolving such institutions.  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and fluency. Key strengths include the use of \"resolution regime\" (Translation 3) and \"loss-absorbing capacity requirements\" (Translations 1, 5). Weaknesses include redundancy (e.g., repeating \"authorized institutions\" unnecessarily in Translations 1, 2, 5), imprecise phrasing like \"dealing with\" instead of \"resolving\" (Translation 2), and inaccurate substitutions like \"distressed institutions\" (Translation 6). The best version combines clarity, concision, and financial terminology accuracy.\n\n# Objective\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal crucially depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing essential financial services required by Hong Kong’s economy.  \nThe translations are largely accurate but vary in formality, conciseness, and emphasis. Key improvements include:  \n1. **\"Overarching\"** (Translation 4) better captures the strategic importance of the objective than \"overall.\"  \n2. **\"Crucially depends on\"** (Translation 4) adds nuance, emphasizing the critical nature of the dependency.  \n3. **\"Highly resilient\"** (Translations 3, 4, 6) is more concise and natural than \"a financial system with high resilience\" (Translations 1, 2, 6).  \n4. **\"Required by\"** (Translations 3, 4, 5, 6) is more formal and precise than \"needed by\" (Translation 2) or \"for the Hong Kong economy\" (Translations 1, 2, 4).  \n5. **\"HKMA\"** (Translations 3, 4, 5, 6) is preferable for brevity, though the full name is also acceptable.  \nThe final translation integrates these elements for clarity, formality, and conciseness.  \nOne of the HKMA’s overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal crucially depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing essential financial services required by Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational practices, or even through disorderly closures in extreme cases. As a regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks are capable of withstanding shocks, responding to crises, and restoring normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The HKMA is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The HKMA is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) cannot guarantee that the financial system is entirely free of risk, and Hong Kong's prudential regulatory regime is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the HKMA strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its failure can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution framework, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for certain financial institutions, including authorized institutions. To establish a smoothly functioning resolution framework in Hong Kong, it is essential to develop resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the HKMA's operational capacity to resolve insolvent authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA needs to adopt approaches that are consistent with and coordinated internationally.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 187 off-site supervisory reviews in 2018, covering a broad range of areas including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management, as well as the business strategies of authorized institutions in response to the development of financial technology. To continue strengthening the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards of directors or their committees of authorized institutions, and followed up on the progress of implementing corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings involving authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to conduct regular on-site inspections, supplemented by thematic assessments to examine areas identified as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 392 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, with credit risk management remaining the primary focus of its reviews and evaluations. Other key areas included technology risk and operational risk management, as well as measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments targeting liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Special review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2018.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with total loans increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was primarily due to the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment, which led to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of mainland-related loan balances increased by 1.4% to HKD 424.9 billion at the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth in Related Loans in Mainland China\n\nThe asset quality of authorized institutions remained stable in 2018. The non-performing loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, far below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the overall banking sector’s non-performing loan ratio fell from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding loans related to the Mainland, the non-performing loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also declined from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened its regulatory oversight to ensure that authorized institutions continued to adopt prudent credit risk management practices. In particular, the HKMA proactively investigated the background and structure of large enterprises to enhance its monitoring system for corporate credit risk. Additionally, the HKMA conducted thematic assessments focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management for large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management for property developer loans, secured loans, and insurance policy-backed loans.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018 but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, introduced since October 2009, have strengthened the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system against potential reversals in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical measures, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt service-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% in August 2010, when the HKMA first introduced a cap on this ratio, to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio for Newly Constructed Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technological Risks\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced the \"Cybersecurity Assessment Framework\" to address the persistently high technology risks facing the banking sector. The first phase of implementation, covering 30 authorized institutions—including all major banks—has been completed, with these institutions having undergone three stages of assessment: self-assessment of risk levels, maturity assessment, and (where applicable) risk information-driven cyber attack simulation testing. These assessments enable authorized institutions to identify operational areas requiring improvement and implement corrective measures to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses. Concurrently, the HKMA has established a timetable for the second and third phases of implementation, which will extend to the remaining authorized institutions. This year, the HKMA will conduct on-site reviews, focusing on cybersecurity controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance at authorized institutions.\n\n# Smart Bank\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with the banking sector on the seven measures promoting smart banking, announced in September 2017, to foster the development of financial technology in Hong Kong. From a regulatory perspective, the HKMA issued a revised version of the \"Guidelines on the Recognition of Virtual Banks\" in May. Additionally, under the \"Banking Easy\" initiative, the HKMA has streamlined regulatory requirements related to remote account opening, online lending, and online wealth management. These optimized regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking user experience. In September, the scope of the \"Banking Easy\" initiative was expanded to encourage banks to adopt financial compliance technology (Regtech), with three new focal areas including monitoring technology to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, Regtech for prudent risk management and compliance, and \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements.\n\nMr. Man Kuet Hung, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech titled \"Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018,\" hosted by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.  \nMr. Man Kuet Hung, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech titled \"Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\" at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018,\" hosted by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nAs the U.S. monetary policy continues to normalize, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened its regulation of liquidity risk to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. During the year, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic assessments to evaluate the preparedness of authorized institutions for potential tightening of U.S. dollar liquidity and their internal capabilities for liquidity stress testing. In addition, the HKMA has monitored compliance by authorized institutions with the \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" requirements that took effect in January.\n\nThe original text discusses the HKMA's review of market risk management and its focused on-site inspections of specific standards. Key evaluation points for the translations:\n**Strengths:**\n- Most translations correctly identify \"HKMA\" and \"authorized institutions.\"\n- Accurate use of terms like \"non-central clearing\" and \"over-the-counter derivatives.\"\n- Proper inclusion of \"Global Foreign Exchange Code\" (though some variants use \"Code of Conduct\" or \"Principles,\" which may be less precise).\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Translation 5** incorrectly refers to \"Financial Supervisory Agency\" instead of \"HKMA.\"\n- **Translation 1** uses \"focused on-site review on\" (awkward phrasing) and \"compliance of authorized institutions with.\"\n- **Translation 2** uses \"recognized institutions\" (less precise than \"authorized\") and \"Global Code of Conduct\" (possibly incorrect term).\n- **Translation 3** uses \"under the Global Foreign Exchange Code\" (correct) but \"examine the extent to which\" is slightly wordy.\n- **Translation 4** and **6** are fluent, using \"special on-site review\" and \"complying with,\" but **6** adds \"specialized\" (redundant with \"special\").\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"HKMA\" consistently.\n- Use \"authorized institutions\" for accuracy.\n- Clarify \"non-central clearing\" over \"non-central counterparty.\"\n- Use \"Global Foreign Exchange Code\" as the exact term.\n- Ensure verb consistency (e.g., \"reviewed\" and \"conducted\").\n- Opt for \"examine the extent to which\" for clarity over \"examine compliance.\"\n**Best Translation:**\nThe HKMA, in addition to reviewing the market risk management of authorized institutions' bond portfolios, conducted a special on-site review of the Global Foreign Exchange Code and margin and risk mitigation standards for non-centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives, to examine the extent to which authorized institutions comply with new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\nThe original text is a concise title requiring precise legal terminology. The junior translations demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy:\n1. The first and fourth translations use \"the Financing of Terrorism\" which is grammatically correct but less concise than \"Terrorist Financing,\" the standard term in international legal contexts.\n2. The third and sixth translations use \"Fundraising\" instead of \"Financing,\" which misrepresents the scope of the activity (financing includes all financial support, not just fundraising).\n3. The hashtag \"#\" is inconsistently applied - while the original includes it, only translations 1, 4, and 6 preserve this formatting. In English, hashtags are typically lowercase unless part of a specific brand name.\n4. \"Combat\" as a standalone verb (used in translations 3 and 6) is less appropriate than \"Combating\" which better matches the original Chinese verb structure.\nThe optimal translation should maintain the hashtag as in the original, use the standard legal terminology \"Terrorist Financing,\" and employ the gerund form \"Combating\" to match the original's grammatical structure.\n\nThe junior translators' translations are largely accurate and fluent, with minor variations in phrasing and terminology. Key strengths include consistent use of formal tone, accurate rendering of technical terms (e.g., \"money laundering,\" \"terrorist financing\"), and clear structure. However, weaknesses include slight redundancy (\"the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services\" appears in multiple versions), inconsistent verb tenses (\"pointed out\" vs. \"points out\"), and minor stylistic choices (e.g., \"transnational criminal organizations\" vs. \"transnational criminal groups\"). The title of the report is translated variably, with some versions omitting \"Risk Assessment\" or altering word order. The phrase \"attracting and facilitating legitimate businesses\" is slightly awkward in some translations; \"attracting and supporting legitimate enterprises\" might be smoother. The best version would consolidate these elements, ensuring precision in terminology, grammatical consistency, and natural flow.\n**Improved Translation:**  \nThe Hong Kong government's \"Risk Assessment Report on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing,\" published in April, points out that Hong Kong's banking system faces significant money laundering threats, a situation shared with other international financial centers and reflecting the growing globalization and complexity of financial services. These threats stem not only from local criminal activities but, to a greater extent, from overseas activities, including illicit proceeds from foreign corruption, fraudulent activities by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions arising from Hong Kong's role as a payment and trade hub. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the government has formulated a policy statement on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, outlining responses to these threats. The aim is to enhance the system's capacity to counter such risks while simultaneously attracting and supporting legitimate enterprises.\n\nThe 2018 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance came into effect on March 1, introducing amendments that provide flexibility in customer due diligence to accommodate the development of authorized institutions utilizing technology to facilitate customer account opening. The new legislation also broadens its scope, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to assume responsibility for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby comprehensively strengthening the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. These amendments, together with revisions to the Companies Ordinance aimed at enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership, assist authorized institutions in carrying out their work against money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTo consolidate and further strengthen communication with authorized institutions regarding policies and regulatory approaches to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued in October a new section titled \"Regulatory Approach to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing\" under its \"Regulatory Policy Manual,\" alongside the revised \"Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Applicable to Authorized Institutions)\" to align with relevant legislative amendments. These measures aim to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce barriers for authorized institutions in adopting new technologies under the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework.\n\nThe role of information sharing in combating money laundering and terrorist financing has become increasingly important. With the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association), the banking sector has actively participated in the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group (Intelligence Working Group), achieving substantial results. A review of the Intelligence Working Group's pilot program commenced at the end of 2018 and is expected to be completed in early 2019.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\nThe junior translators' efforts are largely consistent, but several issues require refinement. First, all translations except the fourth retain the original hashtag (#), which is unnecessary in formal English titles unless explicitly required for context. Second, capitalization is inconsistent: \"Status\" should be capitalized as a title element, while \"status\" in the second translation is lowercase, violating title case conventions. Third, \"financial center\" (American English) vs. \"financial centre\" (British English) is a minor stylistic choice, but \"center\" is more globally recognized in financial contexts. Finally, the fourth translation's inclusion of the hashtag may be appropriate for social media but is redundant in formal writing. The optimal translation should omit the hashtag, use title case consistently, and adopt \"center\" for broader international recognition.\n\nConsolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center is one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) main responsibilities. Seven measures aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors have made good progress this year, with the successful launch of the Faster Payment System (FPS) serving as a prime example.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and formality. Key issues include:  \n1. **Agency Name:** Most translations omit the full name \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\" or use inconsistent abbreviations. Including the full name with the abbreviation in parentheses ensures clarity and professionalism.  \n2. **Verb Choice for \"鞏固\":** \"Consolidating\" is more precise than \"strengthening\" or \"maintaining,\" as it emphasizes reinforcing an existing position.  \n3. **Fintech Terminology:** \"Development and application\" is more natural than \"developing and applying\" in formal contexts.  \n4. **System Name:** \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" is the official name, while \"TransferFast\" or \"Quick Pay\" are either incorrect or informal.  \n5. **Example Phrase:** \"Serving as a prime example\" is more formal and concise than \"serving as the best example\" or \"being a prime example.\"  \nThe improved translation balances accuracy, formality, and clarity while adhering to English conventions and the original's intent.\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but vary in terminology, fluency, and precision. Key observations:  \n- **Terminology**: \"Mutual market access programs\" (Translators 1–3) and \"interconnectedness plan\" (Translator 4) are vague. The original refers to the **Stock Connect program**, a specific initiative, which Translator 6 correctly identifies.  \n- **Gateway phrasing**: \"Primary gateway\" (Translators 3, 5) and \"main gateway\" (Translators 4, 6) are acceptable, but \"key gateway\" (Translator 2) is slightly less precise.  \n- **RMB hub**: \"Global offshore RMB business hub\" (Translators 1–3, 5) is accurate, but \"global hub for offshore Renminbi businesses\" (Translator 3) is slightly wordy.  \n- **Fluency**: Phrases like \"has become more solidified\" (Translators 1, 2, 5) are awkward; \"has become more firmly established\" (Translator 3) is smoother.  \n- **Cultural nuance**: \"Territory\" (Translators 4, 6) is technically correct but less natural than \"city\" or \"Hong Kong.\"  \n**Improvements**: Use \"Stock Connect program\" for specificity, \"primary gateway\" for formality, and \"robust RMB financial activities\" for dynamism. Ensure consistency in terminology and smoother phrasing.  \n**Final Translation**:  \nThe optimization measures for the Stock Connect program linking mainland China and Hong Kong’s capital markets, alongside the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, have further solidified Hong Kong’s role as the primary gateway to mainland China. Hong Kong’s status as the global offshore RMB business hub is also more firmly established, with robust RMB financial activities thriving in the city.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centers, and the green bond market. The HKMA is also strengthening its marketing efforts to promote Hong Kong's advantages to stakeholders both overseas and on the Mainland. On the international front, the HKMA plays a leading role in various regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong's expertise and commitment in related international work.  \nThe translations generally capture the original meaning accurately, with minor variations in phrasing and terminology. Strengths include consistent use of key terms like \"infrastructure financing,\" \"corporate treasury centers,\" and \"green bond market,\" as well as accurate references to the HKMA's international leadership. Weaknesses include occasional redundancy (e.g., \"clearly demonstrating\" could be streamlined) and slight inconsistencies in verb choice (e.g., \"intensified\" vs. \"strengthened\"). The improved version synthesizes the most natural phrasing, prioritizing conciseness and fluency while maintaining formal tone and cultural appropriateness.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to implementing seven measures announced in September 2017, which aim to promote the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment sectors. Key progress made this year on the seven initiatives to advance smart banking includes:\n\n- Successfully launched the fast payment system \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System), fully connecting different banks and stored value payment tools (collectively referred to as \"e-wallets\");  \n- Released the open application programming interface (open API) framework for the banking industry and promoted the sector's implementation of open APIs;  \n- Enhanced fintech research and talent development;  \n- Strengthened cross-border fintech collaboration;  \n- Revised the \"Guidelines on the Recognition of Virtual Banks\" and processed virtual bank license applications;  \n- The upgraded \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox\" (FSS 2.0) is operating smoothly; and  \n- Expanded \"Banking Easy\" to promote banks' adoption of financial compliance technology.\n\nThe Financial Technology Promotion Office (FFO) under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the HKMA's banking departments, plays a crucial role in implementing the aforementioned measures.\n\nWith the implementation of optimized measures under the capital market connectivity initiatives between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's unique position as a key gateway to Mainland China has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the \"Bond Connect\" program with delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement, alongside the State Council's announcement of tax exemption arrangements for overseas investors in Mainland China's bond market, has further enhanced the program's efficiency and appeal. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also closely collaborated with Mainland authorities to explore and implement various financial measures, facilitating individuals and enterprises living, working, and conducting business in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Hong Kong's offshore RMB business continues to thrive, with the RMB deposit funds pool rising 6% year-on-year to RMB 657.7 billion; the average daily transaction volume of the RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a high of RMB 10.101 trillion.  \nThe translations generally capture the core content but exhibit inconsistencies in terminology, numerical accuracy, and phrasing. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology**: \"Simultaneous delivery versus payment (DvP)\" (1st translation) incorrectly adds \"simultaneous\" to DvP, which is a standard term. \"Real-time gross settlement (DvP)\" (2nd translation) conflates two distinct concepts.  \n2. **Numerical Accuracy**: Most translations misrepresent the RTGS figure as \"101.01 billion\" instead of the correct \"10.101 trillion\" (10,101 billion). The 6th translation correctly uses \"1.0101 trillion\" but omits the decimal placement.  \n3. **Fluency**: Repetition of \"Mainland market\" and \"living, working, and doing business\" can be streamlined. \"Financial supporting measures\" (3rd translation) is unnecessarily verbose compared to \"financial measures.\"  \n4. **Consistency**: Mixed use of \"RMB\" and \"yuan\" (6th translation) and inconsistent phrasing like \"deposit pool\" vs. \"deposit funds pool\" affect clarity.  \nThe improved translation above addresses these issues by standardizing terminology, correcting numerical values, and refining phrasing for conciseness and natural flow.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong’s bond market, the HKMA has implemented the “Bond Grant Pilot Scheme” proposed in the Budget, providing grants to institutions issuing bonds for the first time in Hong Kong. It has also closely collaborated with the government to amend legislation, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the “Eligible Debt Instruments Scheme.” Additionally, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion activities, communicating Hong Kong’s advantages to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organizing various large-scale and thematic outreach events to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) leads multiple regional and international committees. The HKMA currently chairs the Standing Committee on Regulatory Cooperation under the Financial Stability Board, the Task Force on Regulatory and Implementation Standards under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for its status as an international financial center. In 2018, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU System), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository achieved 100% system availability, surpassing the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts maintained with two central securities custody institutions in mainland China, the CMU System continues to facilitate the settlement of Northbound Bond Connect transactions and holds mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU System members.\n\nTo enhance the overall security and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designated two additional retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the \"Payment Ordinance\"), subjecting their operations to HKMA supervision. As of now, the number of designated retail payment systems under HKMA supervision has increased to six. The HKMA also regulates 16 licensed stored value facility operators, who are actively launching new products and services to provide customers with more choices and a better user experience. Meanwhile, the scope of electronic cheques and electronic bill payment and presentment services has been further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017, aiming to help the banking industry elevate to a higher level and seize the vast opportunities brought by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, the HKMA made good progress in implementing these measures and advancing the transformation of Hong Kong's financial ecosystem.\n\n# Fast Transfer\n\nThe junior translators' translations are generally accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology and phrasing. Key issues include:  \n1. **System Name**: \"Fast Transfer\" (used in translations 1, 3, 4, 5, 6) vs. \"Faster Payments System\" (translation 5) vs. \"Fast Payment System\" (translation 6). The original 「轉數快」 is best rendered as \"Fast Transfer\" to preserve the colloquial tone.  \n2. **Payment Tool Terminology**: \"Stored-value payment tool\" (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is accurate, but \"value-added payment tool\" (translations 2, 3) is incorrect. \"E-money\" (translation 4) is overly narrow.  \n3. **\"Binding\" vs. \"Linking\"**: \"Account binding\" (translations 1, 3, 5, 6) is more precise than \"account linking\" (translations 5, 6) in the context of financial systems.  \n4. **Currency Terms**: \"Renminbi\" (translations 3, 4, 5, 6) is preferable to \"RMB\" for formality, though both are acceptable.  \n5. **Fluency**: Some translations (e.g., translation 2) use awkward phrasing like \"value-added payment tool users,\" while others (e.g., translation 6) achieve smoother flow.  \n**Improved Translation**:  \n\"Fast Transfer\" was successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored-value payment tool users to conduct real-time cross-bank fund transfers in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi anytime, anywhere, by simply entering the recipient’s mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored-value payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and\/or account binding services.  \n**Final Translation**:  \n\"Fast Transfer\" was successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored-value payment tool users to conduct real-time cross-bank fund transfers in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi anytime, anywhere, by simply entering the recipient’s mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored-value payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and\/or account binding services.\n\nThe original text highlights the rapid adoption and scale of a financial system in Hong Kong, emphasizing registration numbers, transaction volume, and monetary value. The junior translations exhibit varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. Key issues include:\n1. **System Name Translation**: \"轉數快\" is a proper noun. While \"TransferFast\" (1st, 5th) and \"QuickPass\" (6th) are plausible, \"Fast Transfer\" (2nd, 5th) is less precise. \"Turbocharge\" (4th) is a brand name, not the system's name, and \"Fast processing\" (3rd) misrepresents the term.\n2. **Numerical Accuracy**: The 3rd translation incorrectly states 20 million registrations and 48 million transactions, while the original specifies 2 million and 4.8 million. These errors undermine credibility.\n3. **Currency Abbreviations**: \"HKD\" (1st, 5th) and \"HK$\" (4th, 6th) are both acceptable, but \"HK$\" is more standard in financial contexts. The 2nd translation uses \"HK dollars,\" which is less concise.\n4. **Fluency and Grammar**: All translations are grammatically sound, but \"involving a total value of\" (1st, 4th, 5th) is more natural than \"involving a total amount of\" (2nd, 3rd).\n**Improvements**: Use \"TransferFast\" as the system name (closest to the original), correct numerical values, and adopt \"HK$\" for currency. Ensure clarity in phrasing, such as \"accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population\" (1st, 6th) over \"equivalent to\" (3rd).\n**Final Translation**:  \n\"TransferFast\" has received over 2 million registrations within 3.5 months, accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total value of over HK$104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Shared QR Code Standard and its associated mobile application, \"HKQR,\" in the same month. This globally pioneering mobile application integrates multiple QR codes into a single, unified QR code, facilitating merchants—particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—to accept payment solutions from different payment service providers using a single QR code, eliminating the need to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Interface\n\nAn open API refers to the practice of opening up a bank's relevant data to third-party service providers, enabling better and more convenient integration of banking services with those of other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services in a secure environment through a single system. To promote the development and provision of open APIs in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority released an Open API framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based approach and implements various open API functions in four phases. As of the end of January 2019, 20 banks had opened approximately 500 open API interfaces in the first phase, covering data on over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Research and Talent Development\n\nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in terminology, fluency, and accuracy. Key observations:\n1. **Platform Name Consistency**: Translators 1, 4, and 5 use \"TradeLink\" (matching the original Chinese \"貿易聯動\"), while others use \"TradeConnect\" (Translation 2) or \"TradeIX\" (Translation 3). \"TradeLink\" is the most accurate, as \"IX\" is not present in the original.\n2. **Terminology**: \"Proof-of-concept\" (Translations 1, 4, 5) is more precise than \"concept validation\" (Translations 3, 6). \"Digitizing trade documents\" (Translations 1, 4, 5) is preferable to \"digital trade documents\" (Translation 6) as it emphasizes the action.\n3. **Fluency and Grammar**: Translation 2 uses \"building on\" effectively, while others use \"based on\" or \"building upon.\" \"Simultaneously\" (Translation 1) is slightly awkward; \"also\" or \"at the same time\" would be smoother.\n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: \"Monetary Authority of Singapore\" (Translations 1, 2, 4) is the official name, while \"Singapore Monetary Authority\" (Translation 6) is less standard.\n5. **Redundancy**: Some translations repeat \"in October\" unnecessarily (e.g., Translation 1). The original text implies the MoU was signed in the same month as the platform launch, so this can be streamlined.\n**Improved Translation**:  \nBuilding on the results of a trade finance proof-of-concept led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), a consortium of Hong Kong banks launched the trade finance platform \"TradeLink\" in October, which is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade finance processes. By the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined the consortium as members. In October, \"TradeLink\" signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade finance platform \"we.trade\" to conduct a proof-of-concept integration between the two platforms. The HKMA is also exploring opportunities to connect \"TradeLink\" with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the \"Global Trade Connectivity Network.\"\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), at the launch ceremony of \"Trade Link.\"\n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations exhibit several critical issues. First, **title accuracy**: \"金管局總裁\" should be \"Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" not \"Chairman,\" \"Chief Executive,\" or \"Chief.\" Second, **name consistency**: \"陳德霖\" is \"Chan Tak-lun,\" not \"Chen Der-lin,\" \"Eddie Yue,\" or \"Tuen Lam Chan.\" Third, **terminology**: \"貿易聯動\" is best rendered as \"Trade Link\" (a known term in Hong Kong's financial context) rather than \"Trade Synergy,\" \"Trade Connect,\" or \"Trade Linkage,\" which either misrepresent the term or use non-standard phrasing. Fourth, **fluency**: \"at the launch ceremony of\" is awkward; \"at the launch of\" or \"at the launch ceremony for\" flows better. Lastly, **cultural specificity**: \"Hong Kong Monetary Authority\" must be included for clarity, as the term \"Monetary Authority\" alone is ambiguous.  \nThe optimal translation balances accuracy, fluency, and contextual appropriateness by using the correct title, name, and terminology while maintaining natural English phrasing.  \n**Final Translation:**  \nMr. Chan Tak-lun, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), at the launch ceremony of \"Trade Link.\"\n\nTo cultivate more fintech specialists, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) partnered with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) in January to launch an upgraded version of the \"Fintech Talent Development Program\" (FCAS 2.0). FCAS 2.0 comprises four initiatives tailored to young professionals at different stages of their careers, benefiting over 200 students.\n\nMr. Chen De-lin, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the left), Dr. Lam Ka-lei, Chairman of Cyberport (first from the left), Mr. Wang Ming-hin, Chairman of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) (second from the right), and Mr. Wong Hark-keung, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (first from the right), attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony.  \nMr. Chen De-lin, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the left), Dr. Lam Ka-lei, Chairman of Cyberport (first from the left), Mr. Wang Ming-hin, Chairman of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) (second from the right), and Mr. Wong Hark-keung, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (first from the right), attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony.\n\n# Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Shenzhen Municipal Government’s Financial Development Service Office (Shenzhen Financial Office) in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has continued to strengthen its fintech collaboration with Shenzhen. This includes the HKMA’s sponsorship of the “Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Program,” which enabled 50 students to undertake six-week internships at several leading companies in Shenzhen, immersing them in the local fintech ecosystem. Additionally, the HKMA co-hosted the “Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Awards” for the second time with the Shenzhen Financial Office.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the right), chats with the first batch of Shenzhen fintech summer interns.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also signed fintech cooperation agreements in 2018 with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Abu Dhabi International Financial Centre Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Central Bank of Brazil to promote fintech cooperation.\n\nIn August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" initiative in collaboration with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions. The network aims to provide innovative companies with more effective ways to engage with regulators and to foster collaboration among regulatory authorities on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nThe introduction of virtual banks will inject new impetus into Hong Kong’s fintech applications and provide digital banking customers with a novel experience. By targeting retail customers such as individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, virtual banks will also help advance financial inclusion. Following a public consultation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued the revised \"Guidelines on the Recognition of Virtual Banks\" in May and received approximately 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# FinTech Regulatory Sandbox\n\nThe sandbox usage has steadily increased this year. To help establish an ecosystem for financial compliance technology, the sandbox was opened to such projects starting in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 fintech or technology products had been approved for testing in the regulatory sandbox, of which 28 completed their trial phase and were subsequently launched into the market. The HKMA also received 220 cases utilizing the \"Fintech Regulatory Chatroom,\" aiming to obtain regulatory feedback during the early stages of fintech project development. Approximately 70% of these cases originated from technology companies.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in fluency, terminology consistency, and clarity. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology:** \"Regulatory sandbox\" is a standard term, but some translations incorrectly associate the \"Fintech Regulatory Chatroom\" with the sandbox (e.g., Translation 2). Others use \"Financial Technology\" instead of \"Fintech,\" which is less concise.  \n2. **Passive Voice:** Several translations use passive constructions (e.g., \"the related products *had been launched*\") that reduce directness. Active voice (\"were launched\") is preferable for clarity.  \n3. **Redundancy:** Phrases like \"seeking regulatory feedback at the early stage of fintech project development\" (Translation 1) are repetitive; \"during the early stages\" is more natural.  \n4. **Cultural Appropriateness:** \"HKMA\" should be used consistently for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as it is the official acronym.  \nThe improved translation above addresses these issues by:  \n- Using \"regulatory sandbox\" and \"Fintech Regulatory Chatroom\" correctly.  \n- Employing active voice (\"were launched\") for conciseness.  \n- Simplifying phrasing (e.g., \"during the early stages\" instead of \"at the early stage\").  \n- Maintaining consistency with \"HKMA\" and avoiding redundancy.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2018 proved to be a challenging year for investors, as the investment environment was beset by numerous risk factors, including the continued normalization of U.S. interest rates leading to tighter financial conditions, escalating trade tensions among major economies, and the rise of populism alongside heightened geopolitical risks across various regions. Global stock markets broadly declined, while U.S. Treasury yields rose in tandem with the Federal Reserve's four rate hikes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar followed the upward trajectory of interest rates. Several emerging markets, grappling with severe domestic political and economic pressures, experienced significant currency depreciation. Despite these formidable challenges, the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$10.9 billion in 2018.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the delegated powers and the terms of the sub-delegation by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund.\n\n(a) Safeguard capital;  \n(b) Ensure that the overall monetary base is always fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;  \n(c) Ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) Strive to maximize investment returns, subject to the above (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe above objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full support for the monetary base in accordance with the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the debt and equity markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, aiming to preserve asset value and maintain long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has prudently and gradually diversified part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the Investment Portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund's accumulated surplus, plus the total amount of deposits from the Future Fund and the Exchange Fund's affiliated companies that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund account. Due to its unique nature, the Exchange Fund's investment performance assessment does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for the Future Fund. Interest rates on Future Fund deposits are tied to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate determined by the allocation between the two portfolios. As of the end of 2018, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation refers to the asset mix reflected in the investment benchmark, indicating the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. Guided by strategic allocation, the Exchange Fund implements tactical asset allocation to seek returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), with the difference termed \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, establishes the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can select holdings within this permissible range to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Exchange Fund Investment Office in August to oversee investment and related risk management functions. Staff of the office directly manage approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion is invested in global fixed-income markets, with macro risk management strategies for the Exchange Fund executed through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 28% of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment techniques available in the market to achieve sustainable returns for the Foreign Exchange Fund, enabling it to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain insights into market practices and professional investment expertise.\n\nThe original text outlines expenses associated with external investment managers and notes their annual variability due to market factors. The junior translations are largely accurate but exhibit minor inconsistencies in phrasing, word choice, and sentence structure. Key observations:\n1. **\"Transaction costs\" vs. \"transaction fees\"**: While both terms are acceptable, \"transaction fees\" is more precise in financial contexts, as \"costs\" may imply broader expenses not explicitly listed in the original text.\n2. **\"Primarily influenced by market factors\" vs. \"primarily due to market factors\"**: The latter is more direct and concise, avoiding redundancy in phrasing.\n3. **\"Vary annually\" vs. \"vary from year to year\"**: \"Vary annually\" is more succinct and commonly used in formal writing, though both are grammatically correct.\n4. **Sentence structure**: Some translations split the second sentence into two clauses (\"are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually\"), which slightly disrupts flow. A single clause (\"vary annually due to market factors\") is more natural.\n5. **Redundancy**: Phrases like \"primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually\" repeat the idea of causality, which can be streamlined.\n**Improved translation**:  \nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary annually due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, underscoring the critical importance of robust risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has implemented stringent control measures and investment guidelines for all investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, rigorously monitoring compliance with these guidelines and regulatory requirements. To align with the growing diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment strategy, the HKMA has enhanced its risk assessment frameworks and employs advanced risk management tools to evaluate market risks under both normal and extremely adverse conditions. Additionally, the HKMA conducts comprehensive performance attribution analyses to identify the key factors driving investment outcomes, enabling it to optimize the utilization of investment management expertise from both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" published by the Securities and Futures Commission. These principles aim to help investors determine how best to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, which apply to the selection, appointment, and monitoring of external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios must adhere to the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" when managing these investments. Overall, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of relevant ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into investment processes. In addition, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to promote business and investment decisions based on long-term objectives.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Financial Markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, several previously underestimated risk factors emerged one after another, including the pace of U.S. interest rate normalization, the impact of U.S. government foreign trade policies and protectionism on global trade, and geopolitical risks, leading to significant volatility and adjustments in global financial markets.\n\nThe escalating U.S.-China trade dispute has caused significant concern among investors, leading to repeated declines in emerging markets and the Hong Kong stock market since the end of January, with the Hang Seng Index falling as much as 27% from its high that month. Major European and American stock markets also experienced substantial declines starting in the fourth quarter, recording double-digit percentage drops. Overall, global stock markets generally fell in 2018, with the MSCI Global Index, which covers developed market equities, down 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index down 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields generally rose in 2018 due to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy. However, the bond market remained volatile throughout the year. For example, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield increased from around 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November, but softened to 2.7% by year-end due to investor concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute and a shift toward risk-averse investments.  \nThe translations collectively capture the core meaning but vary in fluency and precision. Strengths include consistent use of \"generally rose\" (translators 2, 3, 5, 6) and accurate financial terminology like \"risk-averse investments\" (translators 3, 5, 6). Weaknesses include redundancy (\"rose broadly\" in translators 1, 4), imprecise phrasing (\"more conservative investments\" in translators 1, 4), and inconsistent references to the trade dispute (\"Sino-U.S.\" vs. \"U.S.-China\"). The best version integrates clarity, concision, and standard financial terminology while maintaining natural flow.\n\nIn the currency market, the U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the year in response to U.S. interest rate hikes. The U.S. Dollar Index rose by 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and the Chinese yuan depreciated by approximately 5% against the dollar. Additionally, some emerging markets experienced further currency declines due to domestic political instability and economic uncertainty. For example, the Argentine peso and Turkish lira fell by about 50% and 30% respectively against the dollar. In contrast, safe-haven investment demand pushed the Japanese yen up by 2.7% against the dollar.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1: 2018 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 10.9 billion in 2018, comprising bond investment gains of HKD 57.4 billion, losses of HKD 20.7 billion from Hong Kong equity investments, losses of HKD 38.7 billion from other equity investments, a valuation adjustment of HKD 9 billion for non-Hong Kong dollar assets due to foreign exchange valuation changes, and gains of HKD 21.9 billion from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. Separately, the Strategic Asset Portfolio recorded a valuation adjustment of HKD 5 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 405.49 billion. The total market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolio was HKD 283.6 billion, of which private equity accounted for HKD 191.1 billion and real estate for HKD 92.5 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment was HKD 202.4 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) recorded a 0.3% investment return in 2018, with the investment portfolio returning -2.4% and the support portfolio returning 2.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.9% since its inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 displays the Exchange Fund’s investment return rates in 2018 and its average investment return rates over different time periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return rate was 3.2% over the past 3 years, 2.1% over the past 5 years, 2.8% over the past 10 years, and 4.7% since 1994³.

Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including supporting employee professional development, implementing strict financial controls, and enhancing information technology security, to address the challenges arising from the implementation of new measures and increasingly demanding workloads.\n\n# Stay Connected with the Public\nThe translations demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy and fluency. The most notable issues are:  \n1. **Punctuation Inconsistency**: Translations 1, 2, 5, and 6 correctly retain the original hashtag (#), while translations 3 and 4 omit it, altering the format.  \n2. **Verb Choice**: \"Maintain Contact\" (Translation 1) is grammatically correct but less idiomatic than \"Stay Connected\" (Translations 2, 4, 5). \"Stay in touch\" (Translation 6) is natural but slightly less formal.  \n3. **Fragmentation**: Translation 3 (\"Staying connected...\") is a gerund phrase, which may be unsuitable for a heading unless the context explicitly requires it.  \n4. **Redundancy**: Translations 2, 4, and 5 are identical, suggesting a lack of originality in some submissions.  \n**Improvements**:  \n- Retain the hashtag to match the original format.  \n- Use \"Stay Connected\" for its modern, idiomatic clarity.  \n- Ensure conciseness and alignment with the original’s tone.  \n# Stay Connected with the Public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close communication with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2018, the HKMA held a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 64 other public activities. In addition, it arranged 39 media interviews and issued 462 bilingual press releases, while also handling a large number of media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) core functions, the HKMA organizes media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, covering a range of topics including the linked exchange rate system, fintech development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA launched an official Facebook page in July to further leverage social media for improved public communication.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the original meaning but exhibit minor inconsistencies in terminology, redundancy, and phrasing. Key issues include:  \n1. **Terminology:** Some translations use \"currency board system\" instead of the standard term \"linked exchange rate system\" (e.g., Translation 1 and 3), which is less precise in this context.  \n2. **Redundancy:** Translation 3 repeats \"(currency board system)\" unnecessarily, while others use \"enhance communication\" redundantly (e.g., \"enhanced communication with the public\" in Translation 1).  \n3. **Verb Tense and Nuance:** Translation 4 uses \"held\" instead of \"organizes\" (present tense in the original), and Translation 6 uses \"has hosted,\" which slightly alters the nuance.  \n4. **Clarity and Flow:** Phrases like \"further leverage social media to enhance communication\" (common in multiple translations) are functional but could be refined for conciseness (e.g., \"to strengthen public engagement via social media\").  \n**Improvements:**  \n- Use \"linked exchange rate system\" consistently.  \n- Replace \"enhance communication\" with \"strengthen public engagement\" or \"improve public communication\" for variety.  \n- Ensure verb tenses align with the original (present tense for ongoing activities).  \n- Simplify redundant phrasing (e.g., \"enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel\" is clear but could be tightened to \"expanding content on its existing YouTube channel\").  \nThe final translation above integrates these refinements, ensuring accuracy, fluency, and cultural appropriateness.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), and the Environment Bureau's mascot \"Big Waste Ghost\" collaborated via social media to promote the use of \"Welcome New Year banknotes\" for gifting red packets.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe public enquiry service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) main functions and operations. In 2018, a total of 9,950 enquiries were handled, with approximately half relating to banking policies and regulations, banking consumer matters, and banknotes and coins—particularly the Coin Collection Scheme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and notices, the Fast Payment System \"FPS,\" virtual banks, and the 2018 Hong Kong New Banknote Series.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received annually since 2015, while Figure 2 displays the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Total Public Inquiries\n\nFigure 2: Queries Received in 2018 Categorized by Type\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the *Semi-Annual Report on Currency and Financial Stability* and four issues of the *Quarterly Report* in 2018. It also regularly updated the *Monthly Financial Data Report*, providing the latest and thematic data and analysis on Hong Kong's currency, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 13 *Insight* articles, elaborating on various topics related to its work.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in English, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese, enabling the public to access the latest updates from the HKMA. The website also hosts the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Recognized Institutions,\" maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensed Operators of Stored Value Facilities\" under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated topic pages and prominent quick links to alert the public about new HKMA initiatives, such as \"Faster Payments,\" and important timely information, such as precautions against phone scams and the parking locations of cash collection vehicles under the coin collection program.\n\nTo promote the implementation of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken the lead by launching open APIs on its website starting in July, enabling the public to access key HKMA information. The first batch of 50 open API datasets was successfully launched in July, covering areas most frequently accessed by the public, such as statistical data on the banking system and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and cash van schedules. The remaining 80 datasets will be rolled out in phases by mid-2019. To further facilitate public access to the latest news and information about the HKMA on its website, the HKMA is comprehensively revising the website’s design and content to make it more user-friendly. The redesigned website is expected to be launched by the end of 2019.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority leads by example in promoting the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2. It introduces the public to the HKMA's work and enhances understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre comprises two sections: an exhibition hall and a library, both open to the public six days a week. The exhibition hall showcases the HKMA's functions and the development of Hong Kong's monetary and banking sectors, while also providing reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe Currency Exhibition Area at the Information Centre introduces the design, anti-counterfeiting features, production process, and other interesting facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. It underwent renovation in the first quarter of 2018, incorporating various interactive elements such as educational games that blend learning with fun, enabling visitors to gain knowledge about Hong Kong currency while enjoying the experience. Additionally, the exhibition features an artistic Bauhinia tree composed of 2,018 transparent cubic blocks crafted from shredded banknotes no longer suitable for circulation. This installation complements another mosaic artwork within the area, created using Hong Kong coins. The newly renovated Currency Exhibition Area reopened on 16 August.\n\nThe Information Centre provides guided tours for visitors. During the year, the Information Centre welcomed over 59,000 visitors and conducted more than 580 guided tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the Information Centre has cumulatively welcomed over 705,000 visitors. The library, located adjacent to the exhibition hall, houses more than 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on topics related to Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the \"Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Recognized Institutions,\" as required under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nLaunch an interactive game to introduce the production process of Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nThe artistic Bauhinia tree is suspended in mid-air, accompanied by lighting effects, showcasing its beauty across different seasons.\n\nThe Information Center offers guided tour services to schools and other organizations.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers from various districts attended a public education lecture.\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) work, the HKMA held a total of three public education seminars in 2018, attracting approximately 1,500 secondary school students and teachers. The topics covered included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking system stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, Faster Payment System (FPS), stored-value payment tools, fintech, consumer protection, and employment information in the financial sector. Since their introduction in 1998, the seminars have engaged nearly 60,000 teachers and students.  \nThe translations generally capture the core information accurately, but several refinements are needed. First, \"maintain contact with the community\" is overly literal; \"stay connected\" or \"maintain close ties\" flows more naturally. Second, \"enhance public awareness\" is slightly less precise than \"enhance public understanding,\" which better reflects the nuance of deepening comprehension. Third, consistency in terminology is critical: \"banking system stability\" (not \"financial system stability\") and \"Deposit Protection Scheme\" (not \"Deposit Insurance Scheme\" or plural \"schemes\") must align with the original. Fourth, \"middle school students\" should be \"secondary school students\" to match Hong Kong’s educational terminology. Fifth, acronyms like \"FPS\" require clarification in parentheses for clarity. Finally, \"Since its introduction\" is more concise than \"Since the launch of the education seminars,\" and \"engaged\" (as in Translation 5) adds active tone without altering meaning. The final translation integrates these improvements for fluency, accuracy, and cultural appropriateness.\n\nFigure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Center in 2018\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Employees\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the government structure but employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA continuously streamlines its work processes to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It is committed to maintaining a lean and flexible organizational structure and, where possible, implements new measures and copes with increasing workloads by reallocating existing staff.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is an equal opportunity employer committed to ensuring employees work in a discrimination-free environment. The HKMA’s equal opportunities policy applies to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, compensation and benefits, performance appraisal, promotion, reassignment or training opportunities, and general conduct and ethics.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employs, trains, and maintains a professional and competent workforce to fulfill its policy objectives and adapt flexibly to changing work demands. The Authority requires its employees to uphold high standards of integrity and ethical conduct, adhering strictly to the highest standards of personal behavior and professional ethics at all times, and acting in the best interests of the HKMA.\n\n# Key Human Resources Data as of January 1, 2019\n\n# 2018 Organizational Structure Changes\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office was established on August 1, replacing the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserve Management Department and the Risk Management and Supervision Department. This move underscores the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) investment mandate, strengthens its institutional profile, and enables it to respond more flexibly to market dynamics, aligning with the ongoing expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing establishment and actual number of staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), categorized by department.\n\nTable 1: HKMA Staffing Structure and Actual Staff Numbers as of January 1, 2019\n\nEmployees responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the organizational structure of the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office. In this context, they are grouped under the Risk Management and Supervision Department to facilitate the presentation of their functions.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the salaries and service conditions of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff by seeking the opinions of its subordinate governance committees through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and taking into account market salary levels and practices. The compensation package includes cash compensation and the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), along with some basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a fixed monthly salary (basic salary) and variable pay, which is distributed annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the remuneration of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain recommendations from the HKMA’s Governance Committee. This review considers the Governance Committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of remuneration surveys for the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consulting firms, and other relevant factors. Individual employees with outstanding performance may also receive special adjustments to their salaries to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates approved funds for adjusting annual fixed and variable pay based on individual employees' performance. The variable pay system applicable to investment staff is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. For employees at or above the level of Assistant Governor, adjustments to fixed pay and the distribution of variable pay are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee. Such employees are excused from attending meetings where their own pay matters are discussed. For employees at or below the level of Director, adjustments to fixed pay and the distribution of variable pay are determined by the HKMA Governor, based on authorization from the Financial Secretary and in accordance with the approved lump sum allocated for salary payments.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 lists the compensation data for senior management in 2018.\n\n1. The first junior translator's translation is mostly accurate but uses \"pro-rata basis\" inappropriately; \"annualized\" or \"calculated on an annual basis\" would be better. The title \"Chairman of Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation\" should include \"Limited\" for legal accuracy. The second translation correctly uses \"Commissioner\" for \"專員\" but mislabels \"處置機制辦公室\" as \"Resolution Mechanism Office\" (correct) but \"Deputy Director\" is incorrect. The third translation uses \"Chief Executive\" for \"總裁,\" which is overly formal. The fourth translation misidentifies \"處置機制辦公室\" as \"Debt Repayment Office\" and \"外匯基金投資辦公室\" as \"Fund Investment Office.\" The fifth translation uses \"Fund Investment Office\" again, and \"contract allowances\" is vague. The sixth translation uses \"Resolution Office\" instead of \"Resolution Mechanism Office\" and \"senior management\" instead of \"senior personnel.\"  \n2. Key improvements: Use \"accrued annual leave\" consistently (more standard than \"accumulated\"). Ensure titles like \"Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited,\" \"Resolution Mechanism Office,\" and \"Exchange Fund Investment Office\" are precise. Replace \"pro-rata basis\" with \"annualized\" or \"calculated on an annual basis.\" Use \"Mandatory Provident Fund\" for clarity. Maintain consistency in terms like \"senior personnel\" or \"senior officials.\" Avoid overly formal titles like \"Chief Executive\" unless explicitly stated.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \n1. For employees with less than one year of service, their actual remuneration, excluding accrued annual leave, will be annualized to determine the average annual salary for their respective positions.  \n2. The number of employees listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of senior personnel at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority includes the Chairman of Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, the Commissioner of the Resolution Mechanism Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Exchange Fund Investment Office.  \n3.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019 年 4 月 4 日\n","en":"# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nAuditor-General's Report  \nForeign Exchange Fund Financial Statements  \nThe translations provided by junior translators vary in accuracy and appropriateness. Key observations:  \n1. **Title Accuracy**: \"審計署署長\" is best translated as \"Auditor-General\" (used in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions) rather than \"Audit Commission Chairman\" or \"Director of the Audit Office,\" which are less precise or contextually mismatched.  \n2. **Consistency**: The use of hyphens in the original text (\"審計署署長報告\") should be mirrored in English (\"Auditor-General's Report\") to maintain formal structure.  \n3. **Fluency**: \"Auditor General's Report\" (without hyphens) is grammatically correct but less formal than \"Auditor-General's Report,\" which aligns with official document conventions.  \n4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: \"Auditor-General\" is the standard title in Hong Kong's administrative framework, making it the most contextually appropriate choice.  \nThe best translation balances precision, formality, and adherence to the original structure.\n\n# Auditor-General's Report\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), set out on pages 167 to 273, which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2018, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2018, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as well as in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report titled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, were most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters in the course of my audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value amounted to HKD 36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 11,338.29 billion.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core information but vary in precision and terminology. Translations 1, 2, 4, and 5 are accurate in numbers and structure, though \"measured at fair value\" (used in 2, 4, 5) is more precise in accounting terminology than \"carried at fair value\" (used in 1). Translations 3 and 6 contain critical numerical errors (e.g., 369.3589 vs. 36,935.89 billion), rendering them incorrect. The use of \"HK$\" (4, 5) is acceptable but less formal than \"HKD,\" which is standard in financial reporting. The parallel structure in 2 (\"totaled... amounted to\") and 1 (\"amounted to... totaled\") is slightly inconsistent, though both are grammatically sound. The best translation balances accuracy, terminology, and formality.  \n**Improved Translation:**  \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value amounted to HKD 36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 11,338.29 billion.\n\nThe fair value of 93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities is based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or is estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets amount to HKD 275.631 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the use of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\n- Understand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring measures;  \n- Evaluate and test monitoring measures, including application-level monitoring measures for computer systems;  \n- Obtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;  \n- If market quotations are used, verify prices against independent sources;  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters against independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is appropriate, and assess the reasonableness of the related assumptions and parameters.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Carried at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 20, and 21 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, amounting to HKD 25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also holds interests in three associate companies and 20 joint ventures, which primarily engage in holding overseas investment properties, with the total value of these interests amounting to HKD 44.336 billion. Regardless of whether the investment properties are directly held by the Group or through associate companies or joint ventures, their fair values are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures for investment properties measured at fair value include:\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or by associates or joint ventures, and verify that the fair value is based on the valuations included in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters used.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for other information, which includes all the information in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2018 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of the financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other information and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with information obtained during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no such report.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Officer and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The officer must also implement internal controls that they deem necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Management Officer is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.  \n**Review and Reasoning:**  \nThe translations generally capture the core meaning but vary in precision and fluency. Key issues include:  \n1. **Title Accuracy:** \"Financial manager\" (Translations 1, 4) or \"Financial Commissioner\" (Translation 5) are imprecise. \"Financial Management Officer\" (Translation 2) aligns better with \"金融管理專員.\"  \n2. **Verb Choice:** \"Must be responsible for\" (Translations 1, 4) is overly rigid; \"are responsible for\" (Translation 3, 6) flows more naturally in formal contexts.  \n3. **Clause Structure:** \"In applicable cases\" (Translation 2) is awkward; \"where applicable\" (Translations 1, 3, 6) is standard.  \n4. **Redundancy:** Repeating \"going concern\" unnecessarily (e.g., \"disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable\" vs. \"disclosing matters related to the going concern where applicable\") is acceptable but could be streamlined.  \n5. **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"going concern basis of accounting\" is standard in financial contexts, so no changes are needed.  \nThe optimal translation balances precision, fluency, and adherence to financial terminology while avoiding redundancy and ensuring grammatical correctness.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditors' Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Material misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material if it is reasonably expected that they, individually or in aggregate, could influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process in accordance with the Audit Office's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error;  \nUnderstand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;  \nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;  \nDetermine whether the Financial Management Officer’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users’ attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor’s report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor’s report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;  \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and  \nObtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline, significant audit findings, and any material weaknesses in internal controls identified during the audit period.  \nThis version maintains the precise institutional name (\"Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\") without unnecessary elaboration, uses \"audit scope and timeline\" for clarity and concision, employs \"significant audit findings\" to align with the original's \"重大審計發現,\" and adopts the standard audit terminology \"material weaknesses\" for internal control deficiencies. It avoids redundancy (\"planned audit\" or \"of the plan\") and ensures proper noun capitalization (\"Audit Committee\"). The structure mirrors the original's logical flow while adhering to natural English phrasing.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements concerning independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, as well as the relevant safeguards where appropriate.\n\nFrom communications with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements, thereby constituting key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless laws and regulations prohibit disclosure of a particular matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation that communicating a matter in my report would result in adverse consequences outweighing the public interest, in which case I decide not to communicate the matter in the report.\n\nAuditor General Zhu Nai Zhang\nThe original text presents a title and name requiring precise translation. The junior translations exhibit several issues: (1) inconsistent title usage (\"Auditor General\" vs. \"Director of the Audit Office\" vs. \"Auditor-General\"), (2) name transliteration errors (\"Chu\" vs. \"Zhu,\" \"Nai-chang\" vs. \"Nai Zhang,\" and the addition of a non-existent given name \"Victor\"), and (3) unnecessary hyphenation in \"Auditor-General.\" The most accurate approach is to use the standard title \"Auditor General\" (commonly used in Hong Kong and international contexts) and follow the standard transliteration \"Zhu Nai Zhang\" for the name, avoiding speculative additions or non-standard romanizations.\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
