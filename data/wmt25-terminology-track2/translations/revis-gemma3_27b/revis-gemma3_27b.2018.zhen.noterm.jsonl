{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","en":"# CEO Report\n\n2018 marked the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis. Over the past decade, the international political and economic landscape has undergone significant transformation, witnessing events that even the most seasoned screenwriters would find hard to believe. In last year’s annual report, I described 2017’s financial market performance as a pleasant surprise, while also cautioning of underlying concerns. Looking back at 2018, the year could be characterized as beginning in optimism and ending in disappointment. Shortly after global stock indices reached record highs in January, buoyant investment sentiment was dampened by the onset of Sino-U.S. trade tensions, exacerbated by ongoing Brexit negotiations, deteriorating geopolitical conditions, and four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. This shift led to a rapid reversal of market optimism and a substantial decline in asset prices throughout the year. The MSCI Global Index fell by as much as 20.3% from its peak to its trough, with an overall annual decline of approximately 10%, representing its worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index dropped by as much as 26.7% from its high, declining 13.6% for the year, marking its largest annual drop in seven years.\n\n# Stable Exchange Rates Underpin Confidence.\n\nDespite the volatile external environment, Hong Kong’s financial system remains resilient, and the money market continues to function smoothly. The linked exchange rate system, in place for 35 years, has successfully withstood challenges from capital outflows. Since the global financial crisis, approximately HK$10,000 billion of funds has flowed into Hong Kong dollars. Last year, as U.S. interest rates rose and the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the U.S. widened, activity increased involving the sale of Hong Kong dollars and the purchase of U.S. dollars to profit from the difference. Consequently, the Hong Kong dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar at the beginning of the year, triggering the “weak-side convertibility undertaking” – established in 2005 – for the first time in April, and a further 26 times throughout the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) fulfilled the undertaking by purchasing Hong Kong dollars and selling U.S. dollars in accordance with established mechanisms, absorbing HK$103.5 billion in Hong Kong dollar sell orders in an orderly and transparent manner. As capital flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) rose by 105 basis points during 2018, and banks subsequently raised their prime lending rates following the U.S. interest rate hike in September. The HKMA repeatedly and proactively explained the operation of the weak-side convertibility undertaking to the public through various channels, helping them understand that capital outflows are a normal part of interest rate normalization in Hong Kong and a natural function of the linked exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the linked exchange rate system at the end of last year, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government emphasized that it remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary stability. This has helped to maintain public confidence in the linked exchange rate.\n\n# The banking system is stable and steadily improving.\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed significant vulnerabilities in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to implement a series of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including strengthened corporate governance and risk management in the banking sector. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) focuses its banking supervision on two key areas: prudent regulation of banks’ balance sheet risks, and banking conduct and ethics – both are equally important. As a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, the HKMA is responsible for fully implementing international regulatory standards to ensure the sound and prudent operation of Hong Kong’s banking sector. At the end of last year, Hong Kong’s capital adequacy ratio reached 20.3%, significantly exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8% and improving markedly from the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. Large banks’ average liquidity coverage ratio in the fourth quarter of last year was 167.6%, also well above the statutory minimum of 90%. To avoid repeating the experience of rescuing “too-big-to-fail” financial institutions with public funds during the global financial crisis, the Financial Stability Board established international standards for financial institution resolution mechanisms. Hong Kong is among the few Asian jurisdictions that have fully implemented these standards. The HKMA’s Resolution Mechanism Office is currently implementing the operational details of the mechanism, requiring banks to make structural changes to ensure resolution plans can be effectively executed when needed. Last year also saw the introduction of the “Loss Absorption Capacity Rules,” with further related rules to follow.\n\nIn view of the sustained rise in property prices, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) proactively implemented eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure the local banking system had sufficient capacity to absorb shocks should the property market reverse. These measures proved highly effective: the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018, while the average debt-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. During the year, bank credit grew modestly by 4.4%, and overall asset quality remained strong. The non-performing loan ratio for retail banks further declined to 0.5%, well below both international and local historical averages. The banking sector’s profitability continued to grow last year, with the overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%; several international banking groups achieved solid performance in Hong Kong, becoming key contributors to their group profits.\n\n# A Culture of Integrity: Leadership Sets the Standard.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Bank Conduct Division in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and enhance consumer protection. To address both the underlying causes and outward manifestations of misconduct, the HKMA has, in recent years, actively promoted reforms to banking culture. These reforms encourage banks to cultivate an ethical environment through strong governance, appropriate reward systems, and robust assessment and feedback mechanisms, fostering a culture where ethical behavior is modeled from leadership. Following the issuance of specific guidelines to all Hong Kong banks in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on banking culture at the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments of their corporate culture and the implementation of related measures, ensuring effective implementation of the three pillars supporting a sound banking system.\n\nAlthough the Internet and mobile finance are global trends, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to promote financial inclusion last year, ensuring access for communities unable to utilize new technologies. For example, the HKMA, together with the Hong Kong Bankers' Association, encouraged convenience stores to offer elderly customers a cash withdrawal service without requiring purchases. This network has now expanded to over 300 locations. The HKMA also collaborated with Hong Kong Post to launch a simplified withdrawal service for seniors at seven main post offices located in remote islands and the New Territories. In response to the HKMA’s recommendations, the banking sector actively increased accessibility features throughout the year, providing inclusive banking services for people with disabilities. Notably, the number of ATMs equipped with voice navigation more than doubled within a year, exceeding 700 units. Furthermore, with the HKMA’s active promotion, banks are expected to gradually open more physical branches and introduce mobile banking services in remote areas, enhancing convenience for the public.\n\n# Smart Banking: An Enhanced Experience\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) partnered closely with the banking and technology sectors to launch the “Smart Banking New Era” in September 2017, driving the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong and offering citizens a new payment and banking experience. A key achievement in 2018 was the September launch of “Faster Payments” (FPS). This unique retail fast payment system broke down barriers between different electronic payment platforms and bank accounts in Hong Kong, enabling residents to enjoy instant Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi transfers around the clock. Simultaneously, the HKMA introduced the world’s first “Common QR Code” standard and application, allowing merchants to accept multiple electronic payment systems with a single QR code. Since its launch, FPS has been widely adopted by the public, with over 2.58 million registrations and an average of 60,000 daily transactions, valued at HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 per transaction on average.\n\nLast May, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines for the approval of virtual banks, prompting 33 institutions to submit applications. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have been issued, and they are expected to launch operations within the year. Virtual banks will help promote the development and innovation of Hong Kong’s financial technology sector, providing new services and experiences for individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released an Open Application Programming Interface (OpenAPI) framework in July. Banks will open access to their products and services in four phases, fostering a more flexible and open financial technology environment. This will allow customers to more easily integrate their account data, access information, and select services tailored to their needs. This year, 42 new technology products were tested using the HKMA’s fintech regulatory sandbox, with 28 completing trials and subsequently being launched into the market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with several banks, launched \"Trade Link\" last October. This trade financing platform, which uses distributed ledger technology, enhances the efficiency of trade finance approval processes. \"Trade Link\" is currently testing connections with related platforms in other regions to facilitate cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFinTech is increasingly prevalent in everyday life and is now expanding into the realms of compliance and regulation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) encourages banks to leverage compliance technology (RegTech) to assist with daily operations such as monitoring for suspected money laundering and terrorist financing. Simultaneously, the HKMA is exploring supervisory technology (SupTech) to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its regulatory oversight.\n\n# Reinforcing and Growing Financial Strength\n\nThe competition among international financial centers is a contest of soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in the economic, social, and technological landscape, seize opportunities, and expand Hong Kong’s financial industry. Green finance presents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its bond and project finance markets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the government’s development of green finance, including assisting with the preparation of a HK$100 billion government green bond issuance plan. Last year, we also hosted numerous green finance seminars, including two large international conferences, to raise market awareness and encourage participation in the government’s green bond grant scheme and Hong Kong’s green finance certification services. Green bonds issued in Hong Kong last year exceeded US$11 billion, more than three times the amount issued in 2017.\n\nIn recent years, investment in infrastructure and related projects has been gaining momentum. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016, and its partner network has since more than doubled to 95 institutions, positioning it as a vital hub for infrastructure financing in the region. Last year, the HKMA and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council co-hosted their first high-level roundtable, discussing Hong Kong’s unique advantages in supporting the “going out” strategy of central state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This meeting fostered a strong basis for future collaborative opportunities between SOEs and Hong Kong’s financial and professional services sectors.\n"}

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","en":"# Introduction to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is Hong Kong’s central banking institution, with four primary functions: maintaining monetary stability within the framework of the linked exchange rate system; promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); assisting in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Statutory Authority of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly the Legislative Council) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly the Financial Commissioner) to appoint a Financial Management Commissioner. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Management Officer are set forth in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management Officer dated June 25, 2003, details the allocation of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial matters and indicates that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Financial Management Officer. This correspondence is a public document and is available on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Fund shall primarily be used to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center.\n\nThe Financial Secretary appoints the Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist in the execution of functions conferred by that Ordinance, as well as other functions prescribed by other Ordinances and assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury serves as the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Commissioner of Banking regulates and supervises banking and deposit-taking businesses as empowered by the Banking Ordinance. The Ordinance tasks the Commissioner with handling eligibility matters for licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Regime) Ordinance designates the Financial Secretary as the resolution authority for banking entities. The Ordinance confers a range of powers on the Financial Secretary to carry out an orderly resolution of relevant entities, to mitigate the risk that their unsustainable operations pose to the stability and effective functioning of the financial system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance confer certain powers on the Financial Services Commissioner concerning banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund business.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance stipulates that the Financial Secretary may delegate powers of inspection and investigation regarding a bank's insurance business to the Insurance Authority.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Financial Services Commissioner to supervise banks’ compliance with the Ordinance’s provisions.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance empowers the Financial Secretary to provide assistance with the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to initiate the payment of compensation to depositors of insolvent banks from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund.\n\nThe Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, under the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, may designate and oversee settlement and clearing systems essential for the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and for Hong Kong’s function as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also authorizes the Financial Secretary to administer the licensing regime for stored value facilities and to designate retail payment systems, supervising their operation to ensure safety and efficiency.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, but it may employ staff under terms different from those governing civil servants to attract individuals with relevant experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and its staff are public officers. The HKMA’s day-to-day operations enjoy a high degree of autonomy within the scope of statutory powers delegated to the Financial Management Director.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that currency stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately HK$7.80 per US dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving these monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, instruments, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and preserving its status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the Commissioner for Financial Services is responsible for:\n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system\n- Collaborating with relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market\n- Managing the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins\n- Enhancing the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing and, where appropriate, operating payment, settlement, and clearing systems\n- Collaborating with relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Financial Secretary has control over the Exchange Fund. The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Ensuring Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority operates with a high degree of autonomy in its daily operations and policy implementation, coupled with strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and supervising a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and promoting economic development.\n\nTo effectively fulfill its mandate, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must earn the public’s trust. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach to explaining its policies and operations and proactively addresses issues of public concern within its remit.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is appointed through the Financial Secretary, and is therefore accountable to the public via the Financial Secretary. Furthermore, as the HKMA’s powers are derived from legislation enacted by the Legislative Council, it is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. Beyond this, the HKMA recognizes its broader responsibility to foster public understanding of its role and objectives, and to stay attuned to matters of public concern. In its daily operations and engagement with the community, the HKMA is committed to transparency and maintaining an open policy, with two primary objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public are as fully informed as possible about the HKMA’s work, subject to statutory limitations on the disclosure of market-sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data;\n- To ensure that the HKMA remains responsive to public sentiment and appropriately addresses public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. It maintains extensive communication with the media and publishes a variety of bilingual journals and special publications. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections on economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and supporting materials issued by the HKMA. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital era. The HKMA’s office houses an information centre comprising a library and an exhibition hall, open to the public six days a week. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, delivering talks and guided tours of the information centre to explain its work to the public, particularly students, and to improve financial literacy among citizens. Detailed information on the HKMA’s media relations, publications, and public education activities can be found in the “Institutional Functions” chapter.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively increased both the frequency and detail of its publication of Exchange Fund and Currency Board account data. The HKMA began participating in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) program for central banks in 1999. It also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has featured banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the Legislative Council’s Financial Affairs Committee on the HKMA’s operations and policies three times a year and answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives will attend meetings of the Financial Affairs Committee and Bills Committee as needed to explain and discuss specific matters, and to assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Advisory Committees and Other Committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nThe Financial Secretary exercises control over the Exchange Fund in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This provision stipulates that the Financial Secretary must consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, while other members, including the Commissioner for Financial Management, are appointed individually by the Financial Secretary with the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed for their professional expertise and experience, which enhances the effectiveness of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. Their expertise covers areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, commerce, and law.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five sub-committees responsible for overseeing specific aspects of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work and advising the Financial Secretary through the Committee. In 2018, the Committee held five meetings to discuss matters related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, most of which were previously discussed by the relevant sub-committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and provides recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the HKMA’s remuneration and service conditions, human resources policies, financial budget, and administrative and governance affairs. The Committee held five meetings in 2018, covering the HKMA’s expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual remuneration review, and strategic planning. It also reviewed the HKMA’s regular work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) financial reporting procedures and assesses the effectiveness of its internal control systems, submitting reports as a result. The Committee is responsible for examining the HKMA’s financial statements, the elements comprising those statements, and the accounting principles applied in their preparation, and for reviewing the scope and results of audits with external and internal auditors. Audit Committee members do not hold any operational roles within the HKMA. The Committee convened two meetings in 2018 and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee oversees the operation of the Currency Issuance System and reports on its role as a pillar of Hong Kong’s linked exchange rate system. The Committee is responsible for ensuring the System operates in accordance with established policies, proposing improvements to the System, and ensuring its operation maintains a high degree of transparency. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly publishes the minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Currency Issuance System submitted to the Committee. The Committee held four meetings in 2018.\n"}

With slower global economic growth anticipated, Hong Kong’s economic growth is also expected to slow in 2019.\n\n# Review of the Economy\n\n# Real economy\n\nHong Kong’s economy continued to expand in 2018, although the year-on-year growth rate eased from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), resulting in a decline in the full-year growth rate from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected slower growth in domestic demand and the continuing drag from net exports (Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter but subsequently lost steam, partly due to rising uncertainty stemming from increasing trade protectionism and the impact of local asset price adjustments on wealth. Overall investment expenditure also moderated as business confidence remained weak. Externally, merchandise exports remained relatively stable in the first three quarters but deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter as US-China trade tensions escalated. Merchandise imports also slowed, reflecting weaker export-driven demand. In contrast, service exports recorded faster annual growth, benefiting in part from a thriving inbound tourism sector, while service imports maintained growth largely due to increases in transport, commercial, and other services. In net terms, the trade balance shifted from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, dampening local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to Previous Period)\n\nNote: The quarterly change in total local fixed capital formation, seasonally adjusted, is not specified.\nData source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Monetary Conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar depreciated throughout 2018, largely due to arbitrage activity stemming from the negative interest rate differential between the two currencies. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) was prompted to intervene in the market in April, May, and August, triggered by the lower limit of the linked exchange rate system.  The HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars and sold US dollars at the rate of 7.85 HKD per 1 USD, as stipulated by the system. This intervention contracted the Hong Kong dollar monetary base, reducing interbank liquidity.  Combined with expectations of US interest rate increases, this led to a rise in Hong Kong dollar interbank offered rates (HIBOR).  As funding costs for banks increased, they raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points in late September following the increase in the US federal funds rate target range.  Regarding credit growth, the overall growth rate of bank loans slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018, partly attributable to slower local economic growth and weaker external trade performance.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressure edged up slightly in 2018. Excluding the impact of one-off government relief measures, the underlying inflation rate rose from 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, remaining at a moderate level. The housing rental component increased at a faster pace, reflecting the impact of earlier increases in private residential rents (Figure 2). Broader analysis indicated that nominal labor costs and commercial property rents grew slightly faster, intensifying local cost pressures. Concurrently, import price inflation also climbed as inflation increased in several of Hong Kong’s major sources of imports.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market held steady in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate fell from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, reaching its lowest level since 1997. This decline was observed across most major service sectors, particularly in accommodation and food services. As total employment and private sector job vacancies continued to rise, overall labor demand strengthened, and labor force participation increased slightly. Consequently, real wages and income rose further in response to these tightening labor market conditions.\n\nFigure 3 Labor Market Conditions\nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a notable downturn in 2018. Following strong gains in 2017, the Hang Seng Index reached a record high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, concerns over tightening monetary policy by major central banks, escalating US-China trade tensions, and slowing local economic growth triggered a shift in investor sentiment. The Index fell to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed the year at 25,846 points, representing a 13.6% decline from the previous year. Despite this, average daily trading volume increased from HK$88.2 billion in 2017 to HK$107.4 billion, and total funds raised through initial public offerings in Hong Kong also rose substantially, driven by listings of several companies in emerging technology sectors.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\nData Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Real Estate Market\n\nThe residential property market remained strong in the first half of 2018, but cooled in the second half amid escalating US-China trade tensions, global stock market adjustments, and rising prime lending rates in Hong Kong. Overall property prices fell 9% from their peak between July and December, although they still recorded a 2% increase for the year (Figure 4). Property transaction volume also decreased by 7% year-on-year to 57,247 transactions in 2018, due to a significant reduction in buying and selling activity in both the primary and secondary markets. Furthermore, affordability remained tight, with the price-to-income ratio and debt-to-income ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both significantly higher than long-term averages. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, but declined slightly toward the end of the year. For the year, both prices and rents continued to increase, while rental yields remained low.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic expansion is expected to slow in 2019, reflecting a global economic slowdown. The external environment remains challenging, and the city’s export performance is likely to remain under pressure. Domestically, while low unemployment and rising household incomes will continue to support private consumption, its growth rate is expected to ease, partly due to weakening consumer confidence and the wealth-eroding effects of earlier asset price adjustments. Regarding fixed capital formation, increased housing supply should support steady growth in construction activity, but businesses are likely to become more cautious about capital investment amid heightened economic uncertainty. The government forecasts real GDP growth of between 2% and 3% for 2019, while the latest average forecast from private sector analysts is 2.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nDue to slowing global growth, including in Hong Kong, easing external price pressures and local costs are expected to moderate inflationary pressures in 2019. Recent declines in new residential rental agreements will also help to curb inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 2.2% for 2019, while the government projects an underlying inflation rate of 2.5%. Continued economic growth and a strong tourism sector should keep the labor market tight, with private sector analysts predicting an unemployment rate of around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Unidentified Risks and Factors\n\nThe economic outlook for 2019 faced headwinds from factors such as trade tensions, the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, China’s economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical developments. Should these uncertainties intensify and persist in the long term, financial market sentiment and business confidence could be significantly affected, putting downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activity.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is subject to numerous external and local factors, making its prospects uncertain. Externally, uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions could dampen market sentiment, economic growth, and financial stability, continuing to cast a shadow over Hong Kong’s property market. Domestically, while economic growth is slowing, employment and income levels remain relatively stable, which may support demand for residential properties. Hong Kong interest rates will be partially determined by future US policy rate adjustments, though the direction of those adjustments remains unclear. Looking ahead, increased residential completions in recent years, coupled with the government’s ongoing efforts to expand land and housing supply, are expected to narrow the housing supply-demand gap.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite increased external headwinds, including the US-China trade conflict, Brexit, and rising interest rates, Hong Kong’s banking system remained resilient in 2018. Capital and liquidity remained strong, and asset quality was well-maintained. Higher interest rates expanded net interest margins, significantly boosting bank profitability.\n\n# Balance Sheet Progression\n\nThe banking system continued to grow steadily in 2018, with a 5.9% expansion of its balance sheet. Economic headwinds, including trade tensions between major economies and rising interest rates, prompted businesses to adopt a more cautious approach to new borrowing. As a result, overall loan growth slowed to 4.4% during the year, compared to 16.1% in 2017. This growth was supported by increases in loans to Hong Kong (+6.5%) and from Hong Kong (+2%). However, trade finance declined by 7.6% amid global trade uncertainties. Loan growth to mainland China also decelerated sharply, falling from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system represented 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, unchanged from 2017.  Credit risk remained low, as most of these debt securities were investment-grade instruments issued by governments and banks.\n\nTotal deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a slower rate of growth than the 8.7% recorded in 2017. Anticipating further interest rate increases in the United States, some banks raised fixed deposit rates to attract depositors to shift funds from demand and savings accounts to fixed deposits, thereby securing those funds. Consequently, the proportion of demand and savings deposits fell from 57.4% to 51.4% of total deposits by the end of 2018, increasing funding costs. As deposit growth outpaced loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio declined slightly from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital Adequacy Ratio\n\nThe banking system maintains ample capital, indicating a strong capacity to absorb potential shocks. Capital adequacy ratios are at historically high levels since the implementation of Basel III; the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions rose from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Composite Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered and Recognized Institutions.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio took effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based requirement designed to limit excessive leverage in the banking system. At the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, substantially higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Recognized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust, reflecting its strong capacity to withstand financial and economic shocks. Regarding short-term liquidity – covering funding over a one-month period – Category 1 institutions’ average Liquidity Coverage Ratio in the fourth quarter was 167.6%, significantly above the statutory minimum requirement of 90% applicable in 2018. The average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio for Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nHong Kong dollar interest rates generally rose in 2018, while the spot exchange rate softened, approaching the lower limit of its permitted trading range. Despite this, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly. The linked exchange rate system remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and continues to demonstrate its ability to absorb external shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nHong Kong’s monetary policy’s primary objective is to maintain currency stability, ensuring the Hong Kong dollar trades within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This system operates under a currency board system, which requires the Exchange Fund’s US dollar reserves to provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base. Any change in the monetary base must be matched by a corresponding increase or decrease in the US dollar reserves, maintaining a 100% proportional relationship.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of indebtedness, representing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n- Currency in circulation issued by the Government, including coins\n- The aggregate balances of banks’ settlement accounts held with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to the exchange rate guarantee. When market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the exchange rate to strengthen towards the upper limit of the band at 7.75 HKD per US dollar, the HKMA sells Hong Kong dollars and buys US dollars from banks, increasing the aggregate balance and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates. This action brings the exchange rate back within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per US dollar. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars exceeds demand, causing the exchange rate to weaken towards the lower limit of the band at 7.85 HKD per US dollar, the HKMA buys Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing the aggregate balance and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby restoring the exchange rate to within the established range.\n\n# 2018 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange rates are stable.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which spurred carry trade activity, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12th, the exchange rate guarantee, established at 7.85 since 2005, was activated for the first time. Throughout 2018, the guarantee was triggered a total of 27 times, including 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Despite these interventions, Hong Kong dollar transactions remained smooth and orderly, with the exchange rate fluctuating around the 7.85 level from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar strengthened slightly, partly reflecting tighter interbank liquidity as holidays, quarter-end, and year-end approached, prompting the unwinding of some carry trade positions. The Hong Kong dollar also benefited to some extent from improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market functioned normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rates\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side convertibility undertaking, the aggregate balance and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds decreased from HK$122.68 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$113.62 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$103.5 billion at the 7.85 exchange rate, in response to requests from banks under the linked exchange rate system. Consequently, the aggregate balance fell from HK$17.98 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$7.64 billion at the end of 2018. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund notes and bonds remained largely unchanged during the year. The monetary base continued to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds was HK$1.1362 trillion.\n\nFigure 2: 2018 Net Position and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nHong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally rose throughout 2018, driven by reduced interbank liquidity following the triggering of the exchange rate guarantee and market expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes. Short-term HIBOR experienced greater volatility due to increased funding demand related to new share offerings and seasonal liquidity needs (Figure 3). Overall, short-term HIBOR remained largely below the benchmark rate in 2018. As banking system funding costs rose, banks increased their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the Federal Reserve’s upward adjustment of its target range for the federal funds rate in late September.\n\nThe Federal Funds rate target range was raised four times this year, for a combined increase of 100 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50% to 2.25% to 2.50%. Consequently, the base rate was also increased by a total of 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, moving from 1.75% to 2.75%. These adjustments to the base rate were made according to a revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. The formula sets the base rate at the higher of either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the Federal Funds rate target range, or the average of the five-day moving average of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR).\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) in 2018\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate discount widened in the first four months, largely tracking the movement of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate differential. The 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points – representing basis points – reached negative 620 in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate differential narrowed, the forward discount slightly decreased before widening again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market continued to function normally. Discount window lending increased from HK$10.3 billion in 2017 to HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4: US Dollar\/Hong Kong Dollar Forward Exchange Rate Quotes, 2018\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate Mechanism\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System, implemented in 1983, has been a vital cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. It has consistently demonstrated its resilience in the face of numerous regional and global financial crises. The triggering of the system’s lower limit, a built-in component of the Linked Exchange Rate System, occurred multiple times in April, May, and August due to the Hong Kong dollar’s depreciation. Capital outflows from Hong Kong dollars are a natural consequence of interest rate normalization and a normal function within the system. To enhance public understanding of these operations and the system’s mechanisms, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to clarifying the technical details and demonstrating the robustness of Hong Kong’s financial system. The government remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System, which underpins stability in the foreign exchange and money markets and reinforces public confidence in both the government’s commitment and the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payments and a store of value. During its 2018 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Linked Exchange Rate System, stating that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong – a pillar of stability that supports sustained economic growth, maintains competitiveness, and facilitates the smooth operation of the city’s substantial financial services sector.\n\nGiven that a sound banking system is crucial for the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results. It also maintains supervision of banks’ corporate, property-related, and Mainland China-related lending to ensure the banking system’s resilience to shocks. Banks hold substantial Exchange Fund bills and bonds, which can be discounted through the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate fluctuations. The HKMA is prepared to adjust the issuance of Exchange Fund bills and bonds to provide additional liquidity in response to potential rapid outflows of Hong Kong dollars. The HKMA also reminds the public to prudently manage market and interest rate risks and to prepare for possible market volatility.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) accounts, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to support the monetary base since October 1998. The support ratio – that is, the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base – fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching its limits (Figure 5). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, the entire asset base of the Exchange Fund can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources provide a strong buffer to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Fluctuation of Support Ratio in 2018\n\n# Currency Issuing Authority\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee, operating under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues relating to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. In 2018, the Committee’s work included assessing the potential impact of coordinated exits from unconventional monetary policies by multiple central banks on the supply of U.S. dollar loans from foreign banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of demand for Hong Kong dollars, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical underpinnings of the Linked Exchange Rate System following the implementation of three improvements. Meeting minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee and the reports on the operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Financial Research Centre (the Centre) continues to support research in monetary policy, banking, and the financial sector. Over the past four years, the Centre has significantly increased its focus on policy research, a shift particularly evident in the seminars it has organized and its visiting scholar program. It has strengthened collaboration with major central banks and policy research institutions, jointly hosting a greater number of seminars focused on policy issues. Furthermore, in 2016, the Centre launched a specialized Research Scholar Program to support more research projects related to the policymaking of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\nIn 2018, the research center hosted 16 visiting scholars and published 25 research papers. The center also organized four international seminars throughout the year:\n- The 9th China Economic Annual Seminar, held in January, focused on “The Impact of the Chinese Property Market on Economic and Financial Stability.” Co-sponsored by the research center, the Institute of Market Economy Research at the State Council Development Research Center, and the Financial Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China, the seminar addressed issues and risks related to the mainland’s property market.\n- In October, a seminar on “Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Frameworks” was co-hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). This event marked the 20th anniversary of the BIS’s Asia-Pacific Office in Hong Kong and explored the role of exchange rates within monetary policy.\n- The 2018 Annual Seminar on Central Bank Financial Market Microstructure took place in November, discussing theoretical and empirical research, as well as the policy implications of recent developments in this field.\n- Also in November, the HKMA, the European Central Bank, and the U.S. Federal Reserve co-hosted a China Experts Network Seminar on “China’s New Economic Era.” The seminar examined pressing challenges facing the Chinese economy and their global impact, with a particular focus on policy considerations for central bank policymakers. This was the first time the China Experts Network Seminar had been held outside of Europe.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","en":"# Banking System Soundness\n\nDespite increased uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2018. The effectiveness of liquidity and credit risk management systems at authorized institutions continued to be a key regulatory focus for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) throughout the year. Given the ongoing rise in cyber threats and the broader adoption of financial technology by the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its oversight of authorized institutions’ technology risk management and business continuity capabilities. In May, the HKMA issued a revised guideline on the authorization of virtual banks and began processing applications for virtual bank authorization. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA took further measures to strengthen oversight of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products, promote accessible banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly complex and globalized, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to enhance Hong Kong’s capabilities in combating money laundering and terrorist financing through the adoption of new technologies and a risk-based approach. The HKMA has made significant progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including those related to capital adequacy, disclosure, liquidity, and large exposure limits. Furthermore, the HKMA has strengthened communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution framework for authorized institutions, including the introduction of rules on minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to overcome a key obstacle to their orderly resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s primary goal is to foster the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this requires establishing and maintaining a financial system that is highly resilient and capable of providing the essential financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational practices, or even, in extreme cases, through disorderly collapse. As the regulatory authority, the Financial Secretary plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and restore normal functioning, ultimately helping to prevent bank failures. The Financial Secretary is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licensed banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as “authorized institutions”). The Financial Secretary also oversees the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the Financial Secretary cannot guarantee a risk-free financial system, nor is Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime designed to eliminate all risk. As one of the resolution authorities, the Financial Secretary strives to ensure that, should an authorized institution become unsustainable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution framework, under which the Financial Secretary serves as the resolution authority for certain financial institutions, including authorized institutions. To build a smoothly functioning resolution framework, it is essential to establish resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and develop the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s operational capacity to resolve non-viable authorized institutions. To effectively carry out this work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority needs to adopt approaches consistent with international standards.\n\n# 2018: Year in Review\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nIn 2018, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted 187 off-site reviews covering a wide range of areas, including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, risk management, and their business strategies for addressing financial technology developments. To further strengthen risk governance, the HKMA held 27 meetings with the boards of directors or board committees of authorized institutions and monitored their implementation of corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to conduct regular on-site inspections, complemented by thematic assessments to evaluate areas considered higher risk. During the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 392 on-site inspections and thematic assessments, with a primary focus on credit risk management. Other key areas of emphasis included technology risk and operational risk management, as well as measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments relating to liquidity and market risk management, and the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Dedicated review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions’ businesses involving securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) matters.\n\nTable 1 presents an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s supervisory work in 2018.\n\n# Credit Risk Supervision\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality.\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with total loans increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a 16.1% increase in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing decreased by 7.6% in 2018. This slowdown in lending was primarily attributable to increasing uncertainty in the global economic and trade environment, resulting in a contraction of credit demand.\n\nIncrease in Loans and Advances\n\nLoans to the mainland increased by 1.4% to HK$424.9 billion at the end of 2018, a slower pace than the growth seen in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth of Loans to Mainland China\n\nThe asset quality of financial institutions remained stable in 2018. The non-performing loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, significantly below the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000. During the same period, the overall banking sector’s non-performing loan ratio fell from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding Mainland loans, the non-performing loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also decreased from 0.67% the previous year to 0.54%.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will strengthen its regulatory oversight to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit risk management practices. In particular, the HKMA will proactively enhance its understanding of the background and structure of large enterprises, thereby improving the monitoring of corporate credit risk. Furthermore, the HKMA will conduct thematic assessments focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, including loan approval criteria and risk management for large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management for loans to property developers, and loans secured by insurance policies.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018 but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) since October 2009 have enhanced the Hong Kong banking system’s ability to withstand a potential downturn in the local property market. The average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages fell from 64% in September 2009, before the first round of countercyclical measures, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt service-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the ratio cap was first introduced, to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Repayment-to-Income Ratio for Newly Constructed Residential Mortgages\n\n# Operational and Technology Risk Oversight\n\nThe technology risks facing the banking sector remain relatively high. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Cybersecurity Assessment Framework. The first phase covered 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks, which have completed a three-stage assessment process: self-assessment of risk levels, maturity assessment, and, where applicable, cyber attack simulation exercises guided by risk intelligence. These assessments have helped institutions identify areas for improvement and take corrective actions to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses. Meanwhile, the HKMA has established a timetable for the second and third phases, which will encompass the remaining authorized institutions. This year, the HKMA will conduct on-site reviews, focusing on cybersecurity controls, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance.\n\n# Intelligent Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with the banking sector on the seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote smart banking and foster the development of financial technology in Hong Kong. On the regulatory front, the HKMA issued a revised version of the “Guidelines on the Authorization of Virtual Banks” in May. Furthermore, under the “Banking Facilitation” initiative, the HKMA has simplified regulatory requirements relating to remote account opening, online loans, and online wealth management. These streamlined requirements help banks provide an improved online banking experience. In September, the scope of the “Banking Facilitation” initiative was expanded to encourage the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) by banks, with three new areas of focus: technology for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, Regtech for prudent risk management and compliance, and machine-readable regulatory requirements.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Deputy Governor Ryan Wong delivered a speech titled “Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking” at the Hong Kong Bankers’ Summit 2018, hosted by the Hong Kong Bankers’ Association.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nAs the U.S. monetary policy continues to normalize, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened its regulation of liquidity risk to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. During the year, the HKMA conducted a thematic review to assess the preparedness of authorized institutions for potential tightening of dollar liquidity and their ability to conduct internal liquidity stress tests. In addition, the HKMA monitored compliance by authorized institutions with the “Net Stable Funding Ratio” requirements that took effect in January.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reviewed the market risk management of authorized institutions’ bond portfolios and conducted a targeted on-site review of margin and risk mitigation standards for non-centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives, as well as the Global Foreign Exchange Code, to assess authorized institutions’ compliance with new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nThe Hong Kong government’s “Risk Assessment Report on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing,” published in April, highlighted that Hong Kong’s banking system faces significant money laundering threats, similar to other international financial centers. This reflects the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. These threats originate primarily from overseas activities, though local criminal activity also contributes. These overseas activities include illicit proceeds from foreign corruption, fraud committed by transnational criminal organizations, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions, stemming from Hong Kong’s position as a key payment and trade hub. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the government has formulated a policy statement on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, outlining its response to these threats. The objective is to strengthen the system’s ability to counter these illicit activities while also attracting and facilitating legitimate business.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 came into effect on March 1, introducing amendments that provide flexibility in customer due diligence to accommodate the development of technology-enabled customer onboarding by authorized institutions. The new legislation also expands its scope, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to bear responsibility for countering money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby comprehensively strengthening the AML\/CFT regime. These amendments, together with revisions to the Companies Ordinance aimed at enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership, will assist authorized institutions in their AML\/CFT efforts.\n\nTo consolidate and strengthen communication with recognized institutions regarding policies and regulations for countering money laundering and terrorist financing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a new section, “Regulatory Approaches to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing,” under its “Regulatory Policy Manual” in October. Accompanying this was a revised “Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Applicable to Recognized Institutions)” to align with relevant legislative amendments. These measures aim to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce challenges for recognized institutions in adopting new technologies for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing systems.\n\nThe role of information sharing is increasingly important in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. With the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), the banking sector has actively participated in the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group (the Working Group) and has achieved substantial results. A review of the Working Group’s pilot scheme commenced at the end of 2018 and will be completed in early 2019.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","en":"# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Center\n\nStrengthening Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center is a key responsibility of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Seven initiatives to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment industries have made significant progress this year, most notably with the successful launch of the fast payment system, FPS.\n\nThe optimization measures for the mutual market access programs between Mainland China and Hong Kong, coupled with the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, have further strengthened Hong Kong’s unique position as a primary gateway to Mainland China. Hong Kong’s status as a global offshore RMB business hub has also been solidified, with robust growth in RMB financial activities.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively pursuing new opportunities to bolster Hong Kong’s financial competitiveness, focusing on areas such as infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centers, and the green bond market. The HKMA is also enhancing its outreach to international and mainland counterparts to promote Hong Kong’s advantages. Internationally, the HKMA takes a leading role in numerous regional and global committees, showcasing Hong Kong’s expertise and dedication to these important initiatives.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo bolster Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s financial technology hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to implementing the seven measures announced in September 2017 to foster the development and application of fintech in the banking and payment sectors. Key progress made this year on these initiatives to promote smart banking includes:\n\nSuccessfully launched the fast payment system “FPS” (轉數快), fully connecting different banks and stored value payment tools (collectively referred to as “e-wallets”).\nPublished the banking industry Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework and promoted its implementation.\nEnhanced financial technology research and talent development.\nStrengthened cross-border financial technology cooperation.\nRevised the guidelines on the recognition of virtual banks and processed virtual bank license applications.\nThe upgraded “Fintech Regulatory Sandbox” (FSS 2.0) is operating smoothly.\nExpanded “BankEasy” to promote the adoption of financial compliance technology by banks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Financial Technology Promotion Office (FFO), together with the HKMA’s banking departments, plays a vital role in implementing these measures.\n\nWith the implementation of enhanced measures for the mutual market access schemes between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong’s unique position as a key gateway to the Mainland market has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the “Bond Connect” scheme with simultaneous delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement, coupled with the State Council’s announcement of tax exemptions for overseas investors in China’s bond market, has significantly boosted the scheme’s efficiency and appeal. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also collaborating closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement various financial support measures, facilitating business and investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Hong Kong’s offshore RMB business continues to thrive, with the RMB deposit pool increasing by 6% year-on-year to RMB 657.7 billion; the average daily transaction volume of the RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a high of RMB 1.0101 trillion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively pursuing new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the Hong Kong bond market, the HKMA has launched the “Bond Subsidy Pilot Scheme” outlined in the Budget, providing subsidies to institutions issuing bonds in Hong Kong for the first time. It is also collaborating closely with the Government to amend legislation, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the “Eligible Debt Instruments Scheme.” Furthermore, the HKMA is strengthening its marketing efforts to promote Hong Kong’s advantages to stakeholders in overseas and Mainland China, including organizing a number of large-scale and specialized outreach events to position Hong Kong as a leading hub for green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) chairs multiple regional and international committees. It currently chairs the Standing Committee on Regulatory Cooperation under the Financial Stability Board, the Task Force on Regulatory and Implementation Standards under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe secure and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center. In 2018, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Securities Central Clearing System (CMU System), and the Hong Kong Trading Data Repository (Hong Kong Repository) achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts with two central securities depositories in mainland China, the CMU System continued to facilitate the settlement of Northbound “Bond Connect” transactions and held mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU System members.\n\nTo facilitate the overall security and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designated two additional retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”), bringing the total number of systems under HKMA supervision to six. The HKMA also regulates 16 licensed stored value facility operators, who are actively introducing new products and services to enhance customer experience and provide greater choice. Furthermore, the scope of electronic cheque and electronic bill payment services has been expanded to include cross-border transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# 2018 Retrospective\n\n# Hong Kong as Asia's Fintech Hub\n\n# Advancing Smart Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced seven measures to promote smart banking in September 2017, aiming to help the banking industry advance and capitalize on the significant opportunities presented by the convergence of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress during the year in implementing these measures and transforming Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem.\n\n# Sharp and quick-thinking.\n\nFast Transfer was successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored-value payment tool users to make instant cross-bank transfers in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi by simply entering the recipient’s mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored-value payment tool operators have joined the system, offering customers instant payment services and account linking services.\n\nFast Transfer has received over 2 million registrations within 3.5 months, representing 27% of Hong Kong’s population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total value exceeding HK$104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Shared QR Code Standard and its associated mobile application, “HKQR,” in the same month. This globally pioneering application unifies multiple QR codes into a single code, enabling merchants – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – to accept payment schemes from different payment service providers using just one QR code, eliminating the need to display multiple codes to customers.\n\n# Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen APIs enable banks to share their data with third-party service providers, fostering seamless integration of banking services with other industries. This allows users to access a comprehensive range of services through a single, secure system. To encourage the development and adoption of Open APIs within the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Open API Framework in July. The framework employs a risk-based approach and is being implemented in four phases. As of January 31, 2019, 20 banks had opened approximately 500 API interfaces in the first phase, providing data access to over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Scientific Research and Talent Development\n\nA consortium of Hong Kong banks launched TradeConnect, a trade finance platform based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), in October, building on the results of a trade finance proof-of-concept led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade finance processes. By the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined the consortium. In October, TradeConnect signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade finance platform we.trade to conduct a proof-of-concept integration between the two platforms. The HKMA is also exploring opportunities to connect TradeConnect with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the Global Trade Connectivity Network.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue (left) at the Trade Connect launch ceremony.\n\nTo cultivate more fintech talent, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched an upgraded version of the “Fintech Talent Development Program” (FCAS 2.0) in January, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). FCAS 2.0 features four initiatives tailored to young professionals at different career stages, and has benefited over 200 students.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue (second from the left) attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony with Cyberport Chairman Victor Lam (first from the left), Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Chairman Wang Ming-xin (second from the right), and Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation CEO Albert Wong (first from the right).\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government Financial Development Service Office (Shenzhen Financial Office) in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has continued to strengthen its collaboration with Shenzhen in financial technology. This includes the HKMA’s sponsorship of the “Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Program,” which enabled 50 students to undertake six-week internships at several leading companies in Shenzhen, experiencing the local fintech ecosystem. Furthermore, the HKMA co-hosted the “Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Awards” for a second time with the Shenzhen Financial Office.\n\nMr. Li Dazhi, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the right), speaks with the first batch of Shenzhen Fintech summer interns.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also signed financial technology cooperation agreements in 2018 with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Abu Dhabi International Financial Centre Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Central Bank of Brazil, to promote financial technology cooperation.\n\nIn August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the “Global Financial Innovation Network” initiative in collaboration with 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions. The network aims to provide innovative companies with a more effective way to engage with regulators and to foster cooperation among them on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Bank\n\nIntroducing virtual banks will invigorate financial technology development in Hong Kong and offer customers enhanced digital banking experiences. These banks primarily target retail clients, including individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, and will contribute to greater financial inclusion. Following public consultation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued revised guidelines on the recognition of virtual banks in May and received around 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# FinTech Regulatory Sandbox\n\nSandbox usage has been steadily increasing throughout the year. To help establish a financial compliance technology ecosystem, the sandbox opened to related projects starting in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 financial technology or technology products had been approved for testing in the regulatory sandbox, of which 28 had completed trials and their products had subsequently been released to the market. The HKMA also received 220 inquiries through the “Fintech Regulatory Chatroom,” seeking regulatory feedback during the early stages of fintech project development. Approximately 70% of these inquiries came from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2018 was a difficult year for investors, as the investment landscape faced numerous risks, including tighter financial conditions resulting from continued U.S. interest rate normalization, increased trade tensions between major economies, and the rise of populism alongside heightened geopolitical risks globally. Global stock markets generally declined, and U.S. Treasury yields rose following the Federal Reserve’s four interest rate hikes. The U.S. dollar strengthened with rising U.S. interest rates. Several emerging markets, grappling with significant domestic political and economic pressures, experienced substantial currency depreciations. Despite these challenges, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$10.9 billion in 2018.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Asset Allocation\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee establishes and defines the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund.\n\n(a) Preserve capital;\n(b) Ensure the entire monetary base is fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(c) Maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Subject to the foregoing (a) through (c), optimize investment returns to protect the fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives fully consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full backing for the monetary base in accordance with the provisions of a currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the debt and equity markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the aim of preserving asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is prudently and gradually diversifying a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus plus the total of deposits from the Future Fund and Exchange Fund affiliates linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes through the Exchange Fund. Due to its unique nature, the portfolio’s investment performance is not included in the Exchange Fund’s assessment.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations on an irregular basis. Interest rates are generally tied to the performance of its investment portfolio, with the exception of the Future Fund. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is dependent on the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate determined by the allocation between the two. At the end of 2018, the Future Fund’s assets were allocated approximately 50:50 between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation defines the long-term asset mix reflected in the investment benchmark, representing the Fund’s target allocation to achieve its objectives. The Fund then uses this strategic allocation as a guide for tactical asset allocation, aiming to outperform the benchmark. Consequently, the actual allocation will often differ from the benchmark (the strategic allocation), and this difference is known as “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and define the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can then select investments within this range to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Exchange Fund Investment Office in August, responsible for investment and related risk management. The office’s staff directly manage approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio, which is invested in global fixed income markets. They execute the Exchange Fund’s macro risk strategies through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) engages external investment managers to oversee approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of this engagement is to leverage the best professional investment techniques available in the market to achieve sustainable returns for the Fund, enabling it to benefit from diversified and complementary investment strategies, and to acquire valuable market knowledge and expertise.\n\nExpenses related to engaging external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses vary annually, primarily due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Monitoring\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, highlighting the importance of risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed investment portfolios, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The HKMA has enhanced its risk assessments to align with the increasing diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investments, and employs risk management tools to assess market risk under both normal and severely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed investment performance attribution analysis to identify the drivers of different performance outcomes, thereby evaluating how to best leverage the investment management expertise of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible Investing\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the Stewardship Principles published by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). These principles aim to help investors fulfill their ownership responsibilities in Hong Kong-listed companies. Regarding the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, applicable to the selection, appointment, and monitoring of external fund managers. Fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios must adhere to the Stewardship Principles when managing these investments. Overall, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA closely monitors developments in relevant ESG standards and assesses how these standards can be further integrated into its investment processes. Furthermore, to promote international cooperation on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit organization that aims to promote business and investment decisions based on a long-term orientation.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# The Financial Markets in 2018\n\nIn 2018, several risk factors previously underestimated by the market began to materialize, including the pace of U.S. interest rate normalization, the impact of U.S. trade policy – including protectionist measures – on global trade, and geopolitical risks. These developments triggered significant volatility in international financial markets.\n\nThe escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China caused significant concern among investors. Emerging markets and the Hong Kong stock market have experienced repeated declines since the end of January, with the Hang Seng Index falling as much as 27% from its peak that month. Major European and American stock markets also saw substantial decreases starting in the fourth quarter, with double-digit percentage losses. Overall in 2018, global stock markets generally declined, with the MSCI Global Index, covering developed market stocks, down 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index down 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields generally rose in 2018 due to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy. However, the bond market remained volatile throughout the year. For example, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased from around 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November, but softened to 2.7% by year-end due to investor concerns over the Sino-U.S. trade dispute and a shift towards risk-averse investments.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened this year, following interest rate hikes in the United States. The US Dollar Index rose 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and the Renminbi depreciated approximately 5% against the dollar. Additionally, currencies in some emerging markets experienced further declines due to domestic political and economic instability. For instance, the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira fell by around 50% and 30% against the dollar, respectively. In contrast, demand for safe-haven assets drove the Japanese yen up 2.7% against the dollar.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1: 2018 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded HKD 10.9 billion in investment income in 2018, including gains of HKD 57.4 billion from debt investments, losses of HKD 20.7 billion from Hong Kong equity investments, losses of HKD 38.7 billion from other equity investments, an FX valuation adjustment of HKD 9 billion for non-HKD assets, and other investment income of HKD 21.9 billion from its investment holding subsidiary. The strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation decline of HKD 500 million.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 40,549 billion. The total market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolio was HKD 283.6 billion, comprising HKD 191.1 billion in private equity and HKD 92.5 billion in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn for investment was HKD 202.4 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) achieved a 0.3% investment return in 2018, comprised of a -2.4% return from the portfolio and a 2.1% return from supporting assets. The long-term growth portfolio has generated an annualized internal rate of return of 12.9% since its inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rates of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 displays the Exchange Fund’s investment return rate in 2018 and its average investment return rates over different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return rates were 3.2% over the past three years, 2.1% over the past five years, 2.8% over the past ten years, and 4.7% from 1994. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund’s assets as of December 31, 2018.\n"}

In 2018, the HKMA held 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 interviews, and 64 other public activities. Additionally, it arranged 39 media interviews and issued 462 bilingual press releases, handling numerous media inquiries daily.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) key functions, the HKMA held media briefings and workshops for local and overseas media, covering a variety of topics including the linked exchange rate system, FinTech development, green finance, and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching content on its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the HKMA launched its official Facebook page in July to further utilize social media for enhanced public communication.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue (left) and the Environment Bureau’s mascot, “Big Waster,” are collaborating through social media to promote the use of new banknotes for Lunar New Year red packets.\n\n# Public Questions\n\nThe Public Inquiry Service is an effective channel for enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s key functions and operations. In 2018, it handled a total of 9,950 inquiries, about half of which related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking matters, and banknotes and coins, particularly the Coin Collection Scheme, banking products and services, banking guidelines and notices, the Faster Payment System (FPS), virtual banks, and the 2018 Hong Kong banknote series.\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2015, while Figure 2 details the proportion of inquiry types in 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Total Public Queries\n\nFigure 2: Inquiries received in 2018, categorized by nature.\n\n# Publications\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Semi-annual Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Report in 2018, and regularly updated the Monthly Financial Data, providing the latest specialized data and analysis on Hong Kong’s currency, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published 13 “Insights” articles, elaborating on various topics related to its work.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in English and both Traditional and Simplified Chinese, offering the public easy access to the latest updates from the HKMA. The website also hosts the “Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Securities Business Employees of Authorized Institutions,” maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the “Register of Licensed Stored Value Facility Operators” maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated web pages and prominent quick links to inform the public about new HKMA initiatives, such as the Faster Payment System (FPS), and important timely information, such as precautions against phone scams and the locations of cash collection vehicles during the coin collection program.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is taking the lead in promoting the adoption of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in the banking sector, having launched open APIs on its website starting in July to facilitate public access to important HKMA information. The first batch of 50 sets of open API-formatted data was successfully launched in July, covering areas frequently consulted by the public, such as statistical data on the banking system and Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and cash-in-transit schedules. The remaining 80 sets of data will be rolled out in phases before mid-2019. To further enhance public access to the latest news and information about the HKMA on its website, the HKMA is comprehensively revising the website’s design and content to make it more user-friendly. The completely redesigned website is expected to launch within 2019.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is taking the lead in fostering the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Initiative\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2. It introduces the HKMA’s work and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre features an exhibition hall and a library, both open to the public six days a week. The exhibition hall highlights the HKMA’s functions and the development of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking industries, with reading materials and exhibits available for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking sector, and financial affairs.\n\nThe Currency Display at the Information Centre showcases the design, security features, production process, and fascinating facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. The display underwent renovation in the first quarter of 2018, with the addition of interactive elements, including engaging games that make learning fun. Visitors can now explore Hong Kong currency in an enjoyable and informative way. A striking artistic Bauhinia tree has also been added, constructed from 2,018 transparent cubes made from shredded, unfit-for-circulation banknotes. This installation provides a compelling contrast to a mosaic artwork within the display, created using Hong Kong coins. The revitalized Currency Display reopened to the public on August 16th.\n\nThe Information Centre offers guided tours to visitors. This year, it hosted over 59,000 visitors and conducted more than 580 tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since opening in December 2003, the Centre has welcomed a total of over 705,000 visitors. The library, adjacent to the exhibition hall, houses a collection of over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for research on Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking. It also maintains the “Register of Recognized Institutions and Local Representative Offices” and the “Register of Employees Engaged in Securities Business of Recognized Institutions,” as required under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nLaunch an interactive game showcasing the production of Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nThe artistic Bauhinia tree is suspended in mid-air, with lighting effects displaying its beauty through the changing seasons.\n\nThe Information Center offers guided tours to schools and other groups.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers from various districts attended a public education seminar.\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) work, the HKMA held three public education seminars in 2018, attracting approximately 1,500 secondary school students and teachers. The seminars covered topics including the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking system stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, the Fast Payment System (FPS), stored value facilities, financial technology, consumer protection, and employment information in the financial industry. Since their launch in 1998, the education seminars have involved nearly 60,000 teachers and students.\n\nFigure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Center in 2018\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staff\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the government structure but employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract professionals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA continuously streamlines work processes to maximize efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It is committed to maintaining a lean and flexible organizational structure and, as far as possible, implements new initiatives and manages rising workloads by reallocating existing staff.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is an equal opportunity employer committed to providing a workplace free from discrimination. The Authority’s equal opportunities policy applies to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, compensation and benefits, performance appraisals, promotion, transfer and training opportunities, and conduct and ethics.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and highly qualified workforce to achieve its policy objectives and respond effectively to evolving job requirements. The Authority expects all staff to uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct, consistently demonstrating exemplary personal behavior and acting in its best interests.\n\n# Key Human Resources Data as of January 1, 2019\n\n# Organizational Structure Changes in 2018\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office was established on August 1, replacing the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserve Management Department and the Risk Management and Supervision Department. The establishment of the Office highlights the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) investment capabilities, enhances its institutional image, and enables more flexible responses to market changes, supporting the continued expansion and diversification of Exchange Fund investment activities.\n\nTable 1 lists the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s authorized positions and actual staffing levels, by department.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority: Approved Staffing Levels and Actual Staff Numbers as of January 1, 2019\n\nEmployees responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office’s organizational structure, and are assigned to the Risk Management and Supervision Department for reporting purposes.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Remuneration Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary determines the salaries and terms of service for Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff, based on recommendations from advisory committees under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and with reference to prevailing market compensation levels and practices. The compensation package includes cash compensation and contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), as well as a range of basic benefits. Cash compensation consists of a fixed monthly salary (basic salary) and a variable component paid annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff annually, seeking advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which in turn considers recommendations from the HKMA’s oversight committee. This review takes into account the oversight committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of financial sector compensation surveys conducted by independent human resources firms, and other relevant factors. Individual employees with outstanding performance may also receive special salary adjustments to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed and variable compensation based on individual employee performance. The variable compensation system applicable to employees responsible for investments is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and compensation. Adjustments to fixed compensation and the distribution of variable compensation for employees at the level of Assistant Chief Executive and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee, and these employees abstain from meetings where their own compensation proposals are discussed. For employees at the level of Director and below, adjustments to fixed compensation and the distribution of variable compensation are determined by the HKMA Governor, based on authorization from the Financial Secretary and in accordance with the approved allocation for salary payments.\n\n# Senior Management Compensation\n\nTable 2 sets out the compensation data for senior management in 2018.\n\nIn addition to accrued annual leave, the actual remuneration of employees with less than one year of service will be annualized to determine the average annual remuneration for their respective positions.\nThe number of employees listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of senior personnel at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority includes the President of the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, the Commissioner of the Resolution Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Exchange Fund Investment Office.\nOther benefits include Mandatory Provident Fund contributions or contractual bonuses (as applicable), medical and life insurance, and accrued annual leave during the year.

These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2018, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI consider that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2018, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# The Foundation of Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities regarding the financial statement audit are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Responsibilities of the Auditor for the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters during the audit and in forming my opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and I do not express a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value were HK$36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities were HK$11,338.29 billion.\n\nThe fair value of 93% of these financial assets and all financial liabilities is determined by quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation techniques with inputs derived from observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques based on parameters not observable in the market (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets, totaling HKD 275.63 billion, primarily consist of unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value involve:\n\nUnderstand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including associated monitoring controls.\nEvaluate and test these monitoring controls, including those related to computer system applications.\nObtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities.\nIf market quotations are used, verify prices against independent sources.\nIf valuation method parameters are based on observable market data, assess the suitability of the method and the reasonableness of its assumptions, and verify the parameters using independent sources.\nIf valuation method parameters are not based on observable market data, assess the suitability of the method and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters.\n\n# Valuation of investment property measured at fair value.\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 20, and 21 of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value, totaling HK$25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also has interests in 3 associate companies and 20 joint ventures, whose primary business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with a combined value of HK$44.336 billion. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by associate or joint venture companies, is primarily determined based on valuations from independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgment and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures for investment properties measured at fair value include:\n\nObtain and review valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associate companies or joint ventures, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports; assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate and whether the assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Commissioner is responsible for all other information included in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2018 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to any other information, and I express no assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nAs an auditor, I am responsible for reviewing other information to assess whether it contains inconsistencies with the financial statements or information obtained during the audit, or appears to be materially misstated. Based on my work, I have no matters to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Commissioner and the Audit Committee within the framework of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The officer must also implement internal controls they deem necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Management Officer is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing any related matters if necessary, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Responsibilities of Auditors in Auditing Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if they could individually or in aggregate influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nWhen auditing in accordance with the Audit Commission’s auditing standards, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence supporting my opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect one resulting from error.\nUnderstand the internal controls relevant to the audit to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this does not involve expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies adopted by management and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures.\nDetermine whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting by management is appropriate and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether material uncertainties exist relating to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that material uncertainties exist, I am required to draw attention to related disclosures in the financial statements in my auditor’s report, or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to issue a qualified auditor’s report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to operate as a going concern.\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the underlying transactions and events.\nObtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit and assume full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will report to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements concerning independence, and communicate to them any relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to affect my independence, as well as any related safeguards where applicable.\n\nI determine which matters communicated through the audit committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements, and designate these as key audit matters. I will describe these matters in my auditor’s report, unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit disclosure, or, in extremely rare circumstances, I believe that communicating a matter would create negative consequences exceeding the public benefit.\n\nAuditor General Zhu Nai Zhang\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
