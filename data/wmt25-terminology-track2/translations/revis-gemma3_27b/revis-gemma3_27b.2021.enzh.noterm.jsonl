{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n","zh":"# 行政長官發言\n\n2021年是既鞏固又發展並行的一年。\n\n2021年，疫情勢如破竹地進入第二年：全球供應鏈受到干擾，通貨膨脹壓力不斷攀升，全球金融環境過早收緊的風險亦隨之增加。此外，新冠病毒變異株的出現以及地緣政治緊張局勢的加劇，更增添了不確定性。儘管面對充滿不確定性的宏觀環境，我們仍持續維護貨幣與金融穩定，並保持營運韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來復甦的希望，這得益於COVID-19疫苗的普及接種，以及多個經濟體採取的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟自2020年的嚴重衰退開始復甦。香港方面，在經歷了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮後，2021年經濟增長了6.3%，主要歸功於疫苗接種計劃的推展和特區政府的抗疫紓困措施，為經濟復甦提供了重要助力。\n\n在金融及貨幣保持穩定，宏觀經濟環境亦趨於穩健的背景下，二零二一年為我們提供了開展更多發展工作的契機。我們積極把握良機，大力推進各項發展舉措，以提升金融業的競爭力。在金融科技、綠色金融，以及香港作為連接內地市場的重要橋樑所帶來的機遇這三大重點領域，我們均取得顯著進展。\n\n進入2022年，全球經濟環境面臨挑戰。但正如俗話所說，情況困難時，更要奮發圖強。我們將繼續積極主動，推動發展目標與重點，以更充分的準備應對未來的挑戰，並鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將一如既往地堅定承諾，確保香港貨幣及金融體系的穩健，正如過去多次一樣，我們已成功克服重重困難。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，協助香港抵禦了多次衝擊和挑戰。儘管新冠疫情帶來持續的不確定性，且市場對美國貨幣政策收緊步伐仍有憂慮，但港元匯率及貨幣市場全年均保持有序運作，充分反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n我們對本系統的信心並非一蹴可就，而是建立在多年來穩固的基礎之上。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年《外部部門報告》中再次重申，LERS的可信度源於一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、完善的金融監管與監督、具彈性的經濟體制，以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n信心亦來自我們在公共及市場層面的積極參與，以及有效的監控。尤其在監控方面，我們藉由科技與數據分析，大幅提升金融穩定及宏觀審慎監測的分析效能，使其更為及時、全面。\n\n香港銀行體系的穩健性對金融穩定至關重要。新冠疫情爆發兩年後，本港銀行在流動資金及資本充足率方面仍具韌性，表現符合國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足率為20.2%，遠高於8%的最低要求；大型銀行在2021年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋率為151.9%，亦遠高於100%的法定最低要求。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，銀行業的資產質素在當年大致保持穩定。截至2021年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的堅實支柱\n\n銀行業一向是支持經濟活動的重要支柱，尤其是在新冠疫情對經濟造成衝擊的此刻，其作用更為關鍵。過去一年，主要挑戰在於如何在銀行業管理信貸風險的同時，維持對實體經濟的支持。憑藉多年的監管經驗，銀行持續有效地管理信貸風險。同時，我們與銀行密切合作，透過「預先批准本金償還寬限計劃」（PPPHS）及其他紓緩措施，為企業和個人客戶提供急切所需的協助。\n「預先批准本金償還寬限計劃」於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制同步推出，允許符合資格的企業客戶在預先批准的基礎上，將貸款本金償還期限延後六個月。鑒於部分經濟領域持續受到疫情影響，亟需進一步信貸紓緩，該計劃在2021年兩度延長，直至2022年4月。\n隨後，因應本地新冠病毒感染病例再度增加，於2022年2月，該計劃進一步延長至2022年10月底。令人鼓舞的是，銀行業與香港金融管理局攜手合作，協助企業和個人借款人緩解現金流壓力，即使銀行業本身也面臨疫情所帶來的營運挑戰。\n\n除了信貸環境的挑戰外，疫情亦帶來了更嚴峻的營運環境，以及網路安全威脅不斷升高的數位化趨勢。為提升銀行業的營運及網路韌性，並加強消費者與投資者在數位化加速及網路釣魚詐騙案件頻發情況下的保障，我們已加倍努力。尤其，《銀行業行為準則》已進行修訂，以強化對數碼金融服務中消費者權益的保護。\n\n除了監督工作外，我們致力於推動銀行業的金融包容性及以客戶為中心的文化。提升有需要客戶獲得銀行服務的可及性一直是我們的重點工作，我們與業界密切合作，制定行業指引。繼無障礙銀行服務指引及為智力障礙人士提供銀行服務指引後，業界在香港金融管理局的支持下，於2021年12月發布指引，闡述銀行業為失智症患者及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好常規。\n\n為支持銀行業未來持續發展，並應對新興的增長機會與挑戰，香港金融管理局制定了一項全面的人才發展策略——「連結人才，展望未來」，旨在以更系統、更有針對性的方式培育未來人才，並提升現有從業人員的技能。 我們的全新策略建立在三個「連結」方向之上：連結學生與銀行業、連結從業員與銀行業的未來，以及連結各關鍵利益相關者，以加強策略落實的協作。 我們已推出一系列外展及宣傳活動，吸引更多學生投身銀行業。 為讓大學生更好地為未來做好準備，我們與香港銀行專業發展學會合辦「未來銀行橋樑計劃」，該計劃包含一系列涵蓋實務銀行知識及銀行業高度需求軟技能的課程。 針對現有的銀行從業員，我們一直與業界緊密合作，提供更多符合市場需求的培訓課程，以提升他們的技能。 二零二一年十二月，我們在「加強銀行業從業員能力發展框架」下，正式推出了全新的金融科技模組。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與各方攜手合作，強化人才儲備，促進業界進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強大地位依托無與倫比的機遇。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭優勢，在於其所擁有的獨特且全面的發展機遇。普遍認為，全球金融科技的普及應用、內地金融市場的進一步開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的蓬勃發展，都為香港金融業的未來發展帶來了巨大的潛力。香港金融管理局一直致力於充分發揮香港的獨有優勢，以把握這些機遇。首先，讓我談談金融科技和內地市場的機遇。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情已清楚地證明了金融科技的強大力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為模式。為確保我們能持續領先全球金融科技發展趨勢，並充分發揮金融科技的潛力，我們必須構建一個生態系統，讓各行各業和所有社群都能實際體驗到金融科技的價值。\n\n這個願景促使我們制定新的策略「金融科技2025」，於2021年6月正式公布。該策略旨在促進金融業在2025年前全面應用科技。策略涵蓋五大重點領域，囊括建立成功生態系統所需的各項關鍵要素，並推動生態系統持續良性發展。策略首兩部分，分別為「銀行全面採用金融科技」和「為香港的央行數字貨幣（CBDCs）做好準備」，主要目標是創造更多金融科技應用的需求。策略其餘部分則涉及數據、基礎設施、人才和資金，這些對於生態系統的發展至關重要。\n\n根據此策略，已推出一系列新舉措，其中包括廣東-香港-澳門大灣區金融科技試點平台，讓金融機構和科技企業得以進行先導測試，並從監管機構和使用者處獲得其跨境金融科技方案的早期意見回饋。同時，我們也啟動了商業數據交換試點，藉由運用另類數據來促進中小企業的融資。此外，我們已加強研究將批發型央行數字貨幣（wholesale CBDC）應用於跨境支付，並探討電子港幣（e-HKD）的發展前景，藉此提升香港在採用央行數字貨幣方面的準備，為未來數十年的金融基礎設施奠定堅實基礎。\n\n在把握科技進步帶來的機遇的同時，我們亦將持續鞏固現有成果，並密切留意潛在的新風險。例如，2018年推出的即時支付系統（FPS）近年來發展迅速，截至2021年底，註冊用戶數已達960萬，較去年增長40%。2021年平均每日交易額亦較2020年增加90%，達到約67.3萬筆即時交易。與此同時，鑒於加密資產，尤其是與支付相關的穩定幣快速發展，我們今年早些時候已發布諮詢文件，以徵求市場對制定適當監管框架的意見。\n\n我們全新的前瞻性策略將為金融科技生態系統的健康發展奠定基礎。隨著銀行業日益掌握金融科技帶來的機遇，這最終將有益於金融機構和香港市民，並強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港為內地的首要門戶\n\n香港一直扮演著連接內地市場與國際金融市場的重要戰略角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，以便從事各項金融、投資及財富管理活動。國家「十四五」規劃進一步鞏固香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。配合全球經濟趨勢，這更堅定了我們對香港應持續提升其連接內地與國際市場獨特價值的信心。\n\n二零二一年，我們在提升互聯互通方面取得重要里程碑，為「Connect」系列計劃增添兩項新成員，分別是粵港澳大灣區的「跨境理財 Connect」計劃，以及債券通下的南向交易。這基本上完成了股票、債務和理財等廣泛金融市場的雙向互通。這兩項計劃的推出將為香港帶來多方面的全新機遇。透過滿足內地投資者日益增長的多元化需求，這兩項計劃將擴大我們的債券市場和理財行業的客戶基礎。我很高興看到這兩項計劃運作順利。香港金融管理局將繼續與內地當局協調，隨時間推移進一步優化這些計劃。\n"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n","zh":"# 2022年及以後的要務\n\n全球及本地情況在2022年顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級以及美國聯邦儲備局加息預期引發市場波動；另一方面，本地經濟受到新一波新冠疫情的衝擊。然而，香港金融體系憑藉其韌性和多年累積的緩衝，仍能有效應對不利衝擊。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。為此，我們將致力於防範新興風險，並以靈活敏捷的方式應對。同時，香港金融管理局亦會尋找機會，以鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的領導地位。在管理複雜投資環境下的外匯基金時，香港金融管理局將繼續審慎投資，保持靈活性，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高度流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與健全\n\n全球經濟展望仍面臨重大不確定性。香港金融管理局將密切關注最新發展，並對潛在風險保持高度警覺，以維持金融體系的韌性與穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕，防範風險\n\n展望未來，市場可能因各項不確定性增加而出現較大波動。一方面，若美國聯邦儲備系統持續快速收緊貨幣政策，將顯著收緊全球金融環境，並加劇全球債務壓力。另一方面，自2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級以來，地緣政治風險，包括中美關係的緊張，可能持續存在，並再次引發金融市場動盪。此外，疫情的演變也可能導致大規模封鎖措施重啟，進而加劇全球供應鏈瓶頸，對全球經濟增長和通脹造成不利影響。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年累積的韌性與緩衝，已具備足夠的實力應對不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦擁有充沛的資源、專業能力和堅定承諾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續密切監察本地及國際環境中的風險及弱點，並在必要時隨時部署適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。二零二二年的研究計劃將探討影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛在風險。同時，金管局持續進行的數字化計劃將有助提升其監測能力，以支援對金融系統更全面及深入的分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n隨著發達經濟體收緊貨幣政策，加上疫情影響持續，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預料將持續具挑戰性。與此同時，科技的快速發展和數位化為銀行業帶來了機遇與挑戰。面對不斷演變的金融局勢，香港金融管理局致力透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行能夠有效抵禦衝擊。金管局亦將持續優化和完善銀行監管框架及政策，並充分參考國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監管重點\n\n# 債信風險\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將加強對銀行信貸風險的監測，並採取主動措施，確保整體風險水平持續受到良好控制。\n\n香港金管局將繼續監察疫情發展及其對企業營運狀況的影響，並與銀行及商業界保持緊密溝通，同時檢視各項紓困措施。\n\n# 運營及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局於2022年5月發佈新的《監管政策手冊》「業務韌性」模組後，將繼續與業界溝通，了解持牌金融機構在建立業務韌性架構方面的進展。同時，金管局亦會根據《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》評估結果跟進相關事宜，並監察持牌金融機構落實安全第三層數據備份措施，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。另一個重要的監管重點是評估及應對持牌金融機構對科技服務供應商日益增長依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉疫情期間增強的數位能力及累積的遠程工作經驗，部分運用人工智能的機構正計劃在恢復常態運作的基礎上轉向混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將密切關注此發展，並評估業界是否已充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n香港金融管理局將於2022年專注監控資產負債管理者的流動性及市場風險管理。具體而言，香港金融管理局將繼續監控這些管理者在2023年6月30日前，轉離剩餘倫敦銀行同業拆息設定的進展情況，以應對該等設定即將停止刊發。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐融資\n\n```\n2022年，香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的工作，將繼續著重透過合作與資訊共享，加強對詐騙和金融犯罪的應對，並與AML\/CFT生態系統內的各利益相關者加強合作。其他重點包括，善用增強的數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，實施更廣泛的風險敏感型監管技術，以及推動銀行採用監管科技（Regtech），包括交易監控系統。\n```\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續與政府、銀行業及儲值支付工具業界緊密合作，發佈最新的香港洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估報告，並協助業界應對及防範新興風險。同時，亦會持續研究洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險的發展趨勢，修訂反洗錢法規及相關指引以配合國際標準，並與其他監管機構及國際標準制定機構保持積極溝通與合作。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性退休基金相關業務\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將對持牌金融機構在財富管理及證券銷售、強積金（MPF）以及其他投資及保險產品方面的行為進行現場檢查和非現場監管，重點包括粵港澳大灣區的跨境財富管理通（跨境WMC）計劃、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資掛鉤的長期保險產品。\n\n香港金融管理局在與其他監管機構及銀行業界保持緊密溝通的同時，將就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售提供進一步監管標準指引。這些指引將涵蓋多個範疇，包括與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售保障連結保險計劃，這是一類新型的投資連繫保險產品，具備較高的保險保障水平。香港金融管理局、保險業監管局及強積金計劃管理局將聯手展開一項覆蓋資格延期年金保單及稅務扣減自願供款銷售環節的暗訪行動，以評估中介機構的銷售手法。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在跨境WMC順利啓動後，將繼續與業界及相關監管機構合作，以完善該計劃。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局將着手準備，根據新的《監管手冊》模組及新的《操守準則》監管人工智能信託業務。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》(PSSVFO)、《金融市場基礎設施原則》(PFMI)¹及支付與市場基礎設施委員會(CPMI)發出的各項指引，促進其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施(FMIs)的安全與效率。管理局將因應最新的科技及市場發展，不斷完善金融市場基礎設施的監管框架。\n\n香港金融管理局將與金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）合作，確保其遵守《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI），並按需要進行評估及更新。此外，香港金融管理局將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO（支付與市場基礎設施委員會暨國際證券事務委員會）對PFMI實施情況的監測與評估。香港金融管理局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並根據市場及科技發展以及國際慣例，加強其監管要求。香港金融管理局將與相關機關合作，在適當情況下進一步加強合作監管安排。\n\n# 政策發展\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續完善及優化其銀行監管框架和政策，並融入國際標準及最佳實踐。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾協議\n\n# 資本準則\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續透過實施近年來巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）發布的一系列標準，以強化資本框架，其中包括：\n\n銀行對基金股權投資的資本要求（2013年12月EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日隨《銀行（資本）（修訂）規則》2022年版在立法會通過無異議程序後生效。\n\n2017年12月《巴塞爾三號協議後危機改革最終方案》、2019年1月《市場風險最低資本要求》（2019年2月修訂），以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險框架的定向修訂》，統稱為「巴塞爾三號最終改革方案」。 這些修訂後的資本標準闡明了對信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整（CVA）風險及操作風險的資本處理方式，導入最低產出要求，並強化了槓桿比率框架。為使《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）的修正案於2023年7月1日起生效作為最低要求，目前正與業界協商擬定相關條文（市場風險及信用估值調整風險除外）。\n\n鑒於在巴塞爾銀行監理委員會的大型風險敞口框架下，以及《銀行（風險限額）規則》的實施，香港金融管理局將與修訂《銀行（風險限額）規則》事宜同步，提出對資本規則的相關修訂建議。\n\n# 接觸限制\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續與業界及律政司磋商擬議的《銀行（風險敞口）規則》修訂，目標實施日期與巴塞爾III最終改革方案的日期一致，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露準則\n\n與巴塞爾協議 III 最終改革方案中修訂後的資本標準相關的新或修訂披露要求，主要載於巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發布的《第三支柱披露要求－更新框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發布《槓桿比率披露要求修訂》，旨在修訂槓桿比率的披露要求，以解決銀行在報告日期前後減少特定交易量，藉此人工提高其槓桿比率以供報告及公開披露的潛在「粉飾」問題。為實施這些新或修訂的披露要求，香港當局亦正在準備對《銀行（披露）規則》作出相應修訂，目標是在香港與相關修訂後的資本標準同步生效。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理方針\n\n為配合監管規定及國際標準的發展，香港金融管理局計劃更新若干審慎監管指引（SPM）模組，包括與巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案中修訂後的資本及披露標準相關的模組，例如「逆周期資本緩衝 – 實施方法」、「銀行簿記的利率風險」、「新股認購及股份質押融資」和「壓力測試」。香港金融管理局亦會繼續修訂「行為守則」及《銀行條例》下對獲授權機構外部審計師的報告要求相關的SPM模組，目標是在2022年內完成修訂。鑒於《銀行（風險限額）規則》的建議修訂，相關的行為準則及SPM模組，例如CR-G-8「大額風險及風險集中度」和CR-G-9「關連方風險」，將會相應地更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n憑藉強勁的商品出口、內需復甦以及政府支持政策的助力，香港經濟在2021年重現正增長，扭轉了2019年及2020年的經濟下滑。勞動力市場亦有所改善，通脹保持溫和，並略有上升。儘管預期在第五波新冠疫情緩和後，經濟將繼續復甦，但其力度和速度仍受多項不確定因素和風險影響，尤其包括疫情發展以及美國貨幣政策逐步正常化的進程。\n\n# 經濟概況\n\n# 真實活動\n\n在強勁的商品出口和內需改善帶動下，香港經濟在2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年及2020年的經濟萎縮（表1及圖1）。私人消費因勞動市場狀況改善及政府消費券計劃的推動而恢復。整體投資開支亦隨着商業環境和前景好轉而回升。外部方面，香港全年貨物出口錄得強勁增長，部分得益於全球經濟的持續復甦。服務出口則錄得溫和增長，反映區域貿易及貨運流量活躍，以及跨境商業和金融活動增加。總體進口顯著上升，主要由於本地及轉口需求增加。從淨出口角度來看，外貿在2021年對實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長作出正面貢獻（圖1），原因是總出口增長速度快於進口。\n\n表1 實質GDP按支出項目成長率（環比）\n\n註：經季節調整的固定資本形成季對季變動率資料不可用。資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在年內略有上升，但整體仍保持溫和。扣除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，核心通脹率逐步上升，至12月達到1.4%（圖表2）。隨著本地消費需求改善，餐飲、交通、服裝鞋類等消費品價格重新展現增長動力。同時，全球供應鏈瓶頸以及國際能源與大宗商品價格飆升，也推動進口價格顯著上升。與此相對，住宅物業價格則對整體通脹構成拖累，反映此前私人住宅租金下跌的影響（圖表2）。更廣泛地說，名義工資與商業租金的增長緩慢，有助於抑制國內企業的成本壓力。整體而言，2021年核心通脹率與整體通脹率分別維持在0.6%與1.6%的溫和水平。\n\n圖表 2 核心消費者物價通貨膨脹\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 就業市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，2021年勞動市場亦見改善。失業率在2月達17年高點7.2%後，至12月顯著回落至4.0%（圖3），且此降幅在多數經濟部門均有顯現。整體勞動力需求逐步增強，體現在總就業人數增加（圖3）及私營部門職缺的增長，儘管目前仍未恢復至疫情前的水準。另一方面，12月勞動力較去年同期略減1.3%，部分原因在於勞動力參與率的小幅下降。2021年前三季，名義工資與勞動所得的年增長率雖仍屬溫和，但已展現加速趨勢，扭轉了2019至2020年間的減緩趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n儘管部分主要海外股市持續上漲（圖表4），但本地股市在年內整體表現欠佳。恆生指數延續2020年末的反彈，於2021年2月17日升至31,085點高位，但其後因多項因素影響，市場情緒急劇轉為負面，包括對新型冠狀病毒變種的擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及透過滬港通南向交易的資金流入減少。恆生指數全年收市報23,398點，較去年大幅下跌14.1%。\n\n圖表四 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2021年上半年，在經濟前景改善的帶動下，住宅物業市場重拾上漲勢頭，但下半年因資產市場情緒轉弱而出現盤整（見圖4）。整體而言，2021年住宅價格和成交量分別增長3.7%和24.1%。家庭負擔能力亦進一步加重，部分源於家庭收入減少。另一方面，經歷2019年和2020年的顯著調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍改善，工業物業的價格和租金多已回升至疫情前的水平，而零售和辦公空間的價格則仍低於各自的高點。\n\n請參閱第326至327頁的表B：主要經濟指標，以了解更多詳情，包括2017年到2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟概況與展望\n\n# 經濟狀況\n\n2022年初，本地第五波新冠病毒疫情對經濟活動造成壓力。為此，政府在2022–23年度預算案中推出第五及第六輪抗疫基金，並加強逆周期調節措施以支持經濟。香港金融管理局與銀行界亦將預先批准的本金還款寬限期延長至2022年10月底。\n\n整體而言，預期2022年經濟將持續復甦，惟相較於2021年，增長步伐將趨於溫和，主要受到第五波COVID-19疫情、全球經濟成長放緩、基數效應消退，以及美國貨幣政策正常化等因素影響。政府預測2022年實質GDP成長率介於1%至2%之間，國際機構與私人分析師的最新預估平均值為1.1%。然而，復甦的強度與速度仍存在諸多不確定性與風險，尤其在疫情發展、烏克蘭局勢，以及美國貨幣政策正常化進程等方面。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n隨著進口價格上漲及疫情導致的物流擾亂，通脹壓力預期在短期內將略微攀升，但由於租金回落及本地勞動成本壓力溫和，整體應可大致維持穩定。市場普遍預測2022年整體通脹率為2.4%，而政府則預測整體通脹率及核心通脹率分別為2.1%及2.0%。今年初，本地第五波新冠病毒感染對勞動市場造成壓力，尤其是在人際接觸頻繁的行業。放眼長遠，勞動市場狀況將取決於疫情發展及本地經濟復甦的步調。\n\n# 銀行業經營表現\n\n香港銀行業於2021年保持穩定。銀行總資產適度增長，貸款和存款均有增加。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況依然穩健。資產質量在歷史及國際標準下均維持健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業資產負債表於2021年增長1.9%。 受到經濟復甦的帶動，全年貸款總額增長3.8%，較2020年的1.2%有所增加。 其中，用於香港的貸款增長4.4%，用於香港以外的貸款增長1.1%，貿易融資則增長14.2%。 與中國大陸相關的貸款在2021年增長3.6%，此前在2020年則基本保持穩定。\n\n在負債方面，2021年總存款增加4.6%，相較於2020年的5.4%有所放緩。由於總存款增長速度快於總貸款，整體貸款與存款比率在2021年底微降至71.8%，一年前為72.3%（見圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行業的貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業的資本狀況依然穩健。截至2021年底，本地設立的獲授權機構（AIs）合併總資本充足率為20.2%（圖6）。一級資本充足率為18.2%。兩項比率均遠高於各自的國際最低要求8%及6%。\n\n截至2021年底，巴塞爾III槓桿比率為7.9%，遠高於法定最低要求3%（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況穩健。第一類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）在2021年第四季為151.9%，表現良好。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的25%（圖表8）。\n\n圖8 認可金融機構的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n銀行業的資金來源維持穩定。截至2021年底，第一類金融機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低100%。核心資金…\n\n2A類機構的資本充足率（CFR）於2021年底為150.3%，遠高於法定最低要求的75%（圖9）。\n\n圖表9 指定認可金融機構的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資產素質\n\n資產質素在年內保持穩定，並符合歷史及國際標準的健康水平。截至2021年底，分類貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降；逾期及重組貸款比率亦微降至0.56%，較2020年底的0.57%下降（圖表10）。與中國內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率，於2021年底為0.86%，較2020年底的0.96%下降。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的逾期比率分別維持在0.04%及0.20%的低水平（圖表11）。香港金融管理局將持續密切監察銀行業資產質素的變化。\n\n# 盈利動態\n\n低利率環境持續壓縮銀行業的盈利能力。2021年零售銀行稅前營運利潤下降19.8%（圖表12），主要係因淨利息收入減少（-13.6%）及總營運費用增加（+7.1%）。手續費及佣金收入增加（+9.6%）與貸款減損費用下降（-25.1%）部分抵消了上述影響。淨息差由2020年的1.18%進一步收窄至2021年的0.98%（圖表13）。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比從2020年的47.0%上升至2021年的54.7%（圖14）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠疫情仍具不確定性，且對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的關注日益增加，香港的匯率及資金市場仍維持平穩有序的運作。自1983年實施以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並充分展現了其抵禦外部衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定定義為港幣對美元的匯率在匯率市場上維持於港幣7.75至7.85元兌1美元的區間內。 貨幣體系的結構特點是採用貨幣局制度，規定貨幣基礎必須至少以存放在外匯基金的美元儲備100%背書，且貨幣基礎的任何變動均須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表 1）包括：\n\n債務證書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供充分擔保；政府發行的流通貨幣紙鈔和硬幣；總結餘，即存放在香港金融管理局（HKMA）清算賬戶中的餘額總和；以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及票據 (Exchange Fund Bills and Notes，EFBNs)。\n\n香港元匯率的穩定，仰賴自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）。當聯繫匯率承諾的強方或弱方觸發條件達成時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求，以每美元7.75元或7.85元的匯率買入或賣出港元，藉此擴大或縮減結餘，以壓低或推高港元利率，使匯率回歸7.75至7.85元的聯繫匯率區間。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n受集資活動及南向股票通帶來的資金需求推動，年初港元匯率一度接近強方兌換率上限。其後，受股市回調及部分新上市企業回購首次公開募股（IPO）資金影響，港元匯率一度走弱，但因企業股息支付需求及南向股票通的淨流入，第二季略有反彈。進入下半年，儘管股市情緒轉淡令港元匯率小幅下調，但整體仍維持在可兌換約束區間強方，並持續以平穩有序的態勢交易（圖一）。總體而言，2021年港元外匯市場運作正常。\n\n圖表 1：2021年市場匯率\n\n由於未啟動貨幣穩定化工具（CUs），2021年餘額總計與未償還的外匯基金票據總額幾乎維持不變，約為1,526.3億港元（見圖2）。 該年內，香港金融管理局共發行了額外80億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行體系充裕的流動性下銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，導致餘額總計從2020年末的457.5億港元縮減至2021年末的377.5億港元。\n\n反映庫務債券額外發行及按照既定慣例發行盈餘票據以支付利息，本年度未償還盈餘票據由港幣1,069.2億元增加至港幣1,148.8億元。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 港幣1兆5263億元\n\n總合餘額及未償餘額的EFBNs\n\n圖表2 2021年總餘額（未扣除貼現窗口）及未償還之交換基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於龐大的結餘額，香港銀行間拆息於全年度內大致維持在低水平（圖3）。雖然首季因首次公開招股活動帶動港元需求上升，但各期限的香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）波動不大。其後，即使市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐存有擔憂，HIBOR仍保持大致穩定。至2021年底，HIBOR出現溫和回升，部分反映年底預期的資金需求。在零售方面，銀行維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場運作正常。2021年，貼現窗口貸款減少至68億港元，較2020年的91億港元有所下降。\n\n圖表3 2021年香港銀行間利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）已作為香港金融體系的堅實基石超過三十年，並在應對各種挑戰中展現其穩定性和韌性。儘管全球經濟復甦仍具不確定性，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作依然有序，充分反映聯繫匯率制度的穩健。政府堅定支持此制度。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年《外部部門報告》中再次指出，聯繫匯率制度的可信度源於一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、嚴謹的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續運作順利，流動性狀況及資本充足率均遠超國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直密切監察銀行信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，並關注壓力測試結果，持續加強對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高聯繫匯率制度帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分指定用於支持貨幣基礎。2021年，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）介於109.8%至110.5%之間，並未觸及上下限觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率為110.2%（見圖4）。根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為後備資產組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可動用以維持港元匯率穩定。外匯基金充裕的財政資源，加上穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供堅實的保障。\n\n圖表4 2021年擔保比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣局小組委員會\n\n香港金融管理局外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會小組（CBC）負責監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2021年，CBC審議了包括評估美國通脹情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估因聯邦儲備局縮減量化寬鬆政策所引發的市場波動風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解來自內地的資金流動對香港貨幣狀況的影響等議題。CBC就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，均會在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n截至2021年底，發鈔銀行發行的紙幣流通總值為5926億港元，較去年增加5.9%（圖表5、6及7）。政府發行的紙幣及硬幣流通總值為129億港元，較去年增加1.7%（圖表8及9）。\n\n# 港幣五千九百二十六億六千萬元，增5.9%\n\n發鈔銀行發行紙幣總價值\n\n# 129億港元，+1.7%\n\n政府發行紙幣及硬幣總值\n\n# 圖表 5\n\n截至2021年底，發鈔銀行流通中的紙幣\n\n# 圖表6\n\n2021年底流通紙幣分佈狀況\n\n# 港幣\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局舉辦了14場研討會，吸引逾4,000名參與者，包括銀行及零售業專業人士和學生，以提升他們鑑別真偽港幣的知識及技能。這些關於香港紙幣設計及防偽特徵的公眾教育計劃廣受好評。\n\n# 錢幣收藏計畫\n\n硬幣收藏計劃持續受到公眾歡迎。有關該計劃的更多資訊，請參閱第198頁的永續發展章節。\n\n# 外匯基金票據\n\n拓展票據計劃運作暢順。為配合銀行體系充裕的流動資金，並以滿足銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，香港金融管理局於2021年下半年發行額外800億港元的外匯基金票據。 額外發行導致總結餘相應減少。截至2021年底，未償還外匯基金票據的總面值為1,148.6億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 交換基金票據及債券的未償還金額\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融穩定局 (HKIMR) 於2021年，即使疫情持續，仍保持穩定的研究產出。年內，HKIMR發布了30篇工作論文，並舉辦了九場網上研討會，涵蓋廣泛的主題，包括貨幣政策、銀行穩定性、市場微結構及金融科技發展。HKIMR亦舉辦了一場國際研討會及一場混合形式的網上研討會。\n\n標題為「人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望」的網絡研討會，於八月十七日與香港金融學院聯合舉辦，並透過多個網絡平台進行直播，吸引超過一百一十六萬人即時觀看。\n\n第十一屆國際中國經濟會議，主題為「邁向共同富裕：雙循環下的中國經濟發展」，於十一月十一日舉行。會議探討了與共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷法規、房地產市場、跨境理財通以及粵港澳大灣區金融發展相關的最新政策動向。與會專家學者亦深入分析了人口老化對社會保障基金可持續性的影響，以及中國對全球金融穩定和世界經濟的貢獻。本次會議共設六個分場，吸引三千兩百餘名線上及現場觀眾，總觀看次數達五千九百次。\n\n"}

Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2021年保持穩健，即使面對更具傳染性的新冠病毒變異株對全球經濟復甦構成不確定性。年內，香港金融管理局持續專注於對授權機構風險管理的監管，並因應網絡威脅日益增加及銀行業數位化加速，加強對授權機構營運及網絡韌性的監管。\n\n在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局向銀行提供指引，以促進透過非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作制定針對市場上新產品（例如與保險掛鈎證券及虛擬資產）的監管要求。銀行業操守守則亦已修訂，以加強電子金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資領域，香港金融管理局的首要任務是進一步強化銀行在生態系統中的守門人角色，以及其預防和偵測與疫情期間網上詐騙、馬伕賬戶網絡及其他金融犯罪活動相關的非法資金流動的能力。為提高客戶帳戶對詐騙及金融犯罪的防護，金管局透過公私合作夥伴關係加強與其他相關方的協作與資訊共享。在支持遠程客戶開戶流程的同時，金管局亦鼓勵採用其他技術，包括網絡分析，並於十一月推出首個反洗錢監管科技實驗室。在國際層面，金管局積極參與，使其在全球反洗錢及反恐融資行動中保持領先地位，並在金融行動特別工作組的相關工作中發揮重要作用。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區「跨境理財通」試點計劃於九月順利啟動。本年度，香港金融管理局持續推進在香港推動監管科技應用的兩年路線圖。為銀行業的氣候風險管理奠定基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色及可持續銀行業務，已推出多項措施，詳情請參閱「可持續發展」章節。此外，亦加強了軟性基礎設施建設，包括推廣以客戶為中心的企業文化，並與銀行業界合作推出人才培訓計劃。\n\n同時，香港金融管理局與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監管政策和流程。在本地推行國際監管標準方面取得顯著進展，當中包括資本充足率和資訊披露等規定。金融管理局繼續致力完善授權銀行危機處理框架，包括制定新的解決標準，以及落實吸收虧損能力的要求，以提升銀行在緊急情況下的可有序處理能力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於一個高度韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行營運方式可能影響金融體系的穩定，在極端情況下，更可能導致失序倒閉。 貨幣管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，透過確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中恢復運作，從而預防金融機構失效。 貨幣管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監管，並負責認可香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可金融機構。\n\n然而，香港金融管理局無法保證，亦非香港審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，作為處置機構，香港金融管理局致力於確保當認可金融機構出現不可持續經營的情況時，其破產程序能夠有序地進行。為此，香港已建立金融機構處置機制，香港金融管理局則為該機制中負責處置認可金融機構等不同類型機構的處置機構。為有效推行此機制，制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除影響認可金融機構可處置性的障礙，並提升香港金融管理局處理認可金融機構破產的運作能力至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，香港金融管理局採取與國際接軌且協調一致的方法。\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施。在監管這些基礎設施時，金管局旨在提升其整體安全及效率，降低系統性風險，並促進市場透明度。增強金融市場基礎設施的韌性，可保障香港的貨幣及金融系統免受相關中斷可能造成的影響。有關金管局監管方法的詳情，請參閱金管局網站。\n\n# 年度總結 (2021年)\n\n# 授權\n\n二零二一年底，香港有：\n\n年內，香港金融管理局（金管局）向三間非本地銀行批出兩張銀行牌照及一張受限制銀行牌照。金管局亦批准一間外國交易平台營運商從事貨幣經紀業務。年內，三間持牌銀行及兩間受限制牌照銀行的授權均被撤銷。\n\n有關人工智能及香港本地代表辦事處的詳情，請參閱第321至324頁及第330至333頁的附錄和D至F表。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n香港金融管理局進行了189項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為持續加強風險管治，香港金融管理局與持牌金融機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會層級委員會舉行了40次會議。此外，香港金融管理局、持牌金融機構及其外部審計師亦舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了現場檢查外，香港金融管理局亦定期進行主題審查，並針對風險較高的領域加強監管。本年度共進行了679次現場檢查及主題審查，重點關注信貸風險管理。隨着銀行對科技應用的日益普及，營運風險和科技風險的管理亦成為另一主要關注範疇。香港金融管理局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場檢查和主題審查次數。此外，專門團隊對持牌機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務中，人工智能技術的應用情況，以及其反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施進行了現場檢查和主題審查。表1概述了香港金融管理局2021年的監管活動。\n\n# 信貸風險\n\n#信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款額於2021年較2020年增長3.8%，2020年則增長1.2%。表2顯示貸款及墊款增長的細分。\n\n與內地相關的貸款於2021年增加3.6%，至4,725億港元（表3）。\n\n銀行業的資產品質在年內保持穩定，並符合歷史及國際標準的健康水準。截至2021年底，行業不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。與中國大陸相關的貸款比率亦由去年的0.96%下降至0.86%。\n\n年內，新冠疫情持續對部分經濟領域造成影響，而中國內地房地產市場的信用事件亦引起市場關注。香港金融管理局加強並深化監察，著重審視銀行對高槓桿借款人的風險敞口。金管局與銀行保持緊密溝通，以便評估經濟及市場發展的最新情況，以及銀行風險管理措施的充分性。銀行體系整體信用風險可控。金管局最新的償付能力壓力測試結果顯示，銀行業持續維持充足的資本緩衝，足以應對極端壓力。\n\n本年度進行了重點審查，以評估採用人工智能技術的系統在貸款分類及貸款減損提列、海外貸款業務，以及向私人銀行及財富管理客戶提供的擔保貸款方面的控制措施。\n\n# 紓解客戶現金流壓力\n\n九月，香港金融管理局與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制宣布，將預先批准的本金償還延期計劃延長六個月，至二零二二年四月底。此計劃於二零二零年五月首次推出，旨在讓合資格的企業客戶延後貸款本金償還六個月。鑒於本地新型冠狀病毒感染病例再度增加，該計劃於二零二二年二月進一步延長至二零二二年十月底。此外，該計劃亦已優化，為具備足夠財力且有意逐步恢復本金償還的客戶提供為期一年的部分本金償還選項。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准超過8.3萬宗貸款期限延長及其他紓緩措施，涉及總金額逾9200億港元。 其中，針對個人客戶方面，銀行已批准超過5.2萬宗住宅按揭及其他個人貸款的本金寬限期，涉及金額逾530億港元。\n\n# 房產按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局逐步推行一系列逆周期宏觀審慎措施，加強銀行風險管理能力，提升銀行業對本地樓市可能出現急劇下跌的抗風險能力。2021年12月獲批准的新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率為53%，較2009年9月首次推行這些措施前的64%有所下降。同期，新按揭貸款的平均還款比率維持在較低水平，為36%，較2010年8月首次實施還款比率上限時的41%為低（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n鑒於銀行日益依賴科技以支持其營運，香港金融管理局加強了對營運及科技風險的監管。本年度重點監管範疇包括雲端外包及遠距工作安排的控制措施。香港金融管理局於12月發起業界諮詢，就新《監管政策手冊》（SPM）「營運韌性」模組草案徵求意見。新模組旨在為銀行提供指引，協助其建立全面且整合的營運韌性架構。\n\n香港金融管理局於一月推出《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》，以反映最新的網絡安全風險管理良好做法。本年度，金管局監察了持牌金融機構對《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》的落實情況，並審閱了它們的網絡韌性能力。鑒於破壞性網絡攻擊的風險日益增加，金管局於五月要求所有持牌金融機構評估是否需要設立安全的第三級數據備份，並可參考香港銀行同業公會發布的《安全三級數據備份指引》。\n\n面對日益嚴峻的風險和網絡釣魚攻擊不斷增加，香港金融管理局與業界緊密合作，加強網上及手機銀行服務的安全性。香港金融管理局與香港銀行公會於七月展開一項大規模聯合公眾教育運動，主題為「保護您的個人數字鑰匙；謹防詐騙連結！」（參見圖1）。\n\n圖1 提高公眾對釣魚攻擊的意識\n\n保護您的數位憑證，小心詐騙連結！\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n為加強監測授權機構的流動風險敞口，香港金融管理局在其流動性壓力測試框架中納入了額外情境，以評估授權機構應對長時間流動衝擊的能力。\n\n香港金融管理局於本年度進行主題審查，以評估授權機構流動性壓力測試計劃的充分性，並評估其監測指標及控制限額在管理流動性風險方面的充足性。香港金融管理局亦已審查授權機構在債務證券投資方面的市場風險管理架構的有效性，以及對庫務活動的作業控制。\n\n香港金融管理局密切監察金融機構為應對倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）過渡所做的準備。局方與業界協會合作，並開發工具協助金融機構支持客戶轉向替代參考利率，包括發放傳單以提高企業對過渡的意識，以及發佈貸款市場中可用以取代美元LIBOR選項的資訊備忘錄。金融機構已大幅修改參照LIBOR利率的合約，而這些利率於2021年底停止公布。局方亦提醒金融機構自2022年1月1日起不得再訂立新的LIBOR合約。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n在2021年，香港金管局透過多管齊下的方式，鞏固香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心地位，並取得顯著進展。\n\n香港金融管理局公布「金融科技2025」策略，旨在推廣金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並進一步鞏固香港作為金融科技中心的地位。在快速支付系統方面，新冠疫情期間，本年度交易額出現顯著增長。\n\n憑藉世界一流的市場基礎設施以及「互聯互通」機制，香港已成為內地資金參與全球市場，以及國際投資者接觸快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。本年度在「互聯互通」機制下，新增了「跨境財富管理互聯互通」和「債券通南向交易」，進一步拓展了該機制的功能。\n\n在2021年，香港金融管理局投入大量資源，積極拓展新的商業機會，以強化香港金融平台的競爭力，重點領域包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心以及綠色和可持續金融。為推廣香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強與海外及內地相關機構的聯繫，讓他們了解香港金融體系的穩健性及其發展前景。\n\n同時，香港金融管理局積極參與國際及區域中央銀行和監管論壇，以協助維持全球金融穩定並促進金融市場發展。\n\n# 總覽\n\n香港金融管理局宣布其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列推動金融科技廣泛應用及強化香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位的舉措。香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門合作，在過去一年中積極推動多項關鍵倡議，其中包括：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）的採用\n推行科技基線評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣中心，其地位依然穩固，離岸人民幣業務在今年錄得強勁增長。 隨著主要金融市場指數持續納入境內證券，流入人民幣資產的速度亦持續加快。香港在促進國際投資者增加對人民幣資產的配置方面發揮著不可或缺的作用，內地與香港的「滬港通」及「深港通」計劃被廣泛視為國際投資者進入內地資本市場的首選渠道。2021年，北向債券通的日均成交額增加34%，達到約人民幣258億元。\n\n在北向債券通取得成功後，南向債券通於九月推出，實現了內地與國際債券市場的雙向互通。同月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）、香港金融管理局（HKMA）及澳門金融管理局公布了粵港澳大灣區（GBA）跨境理財通（Crossboundary WMC）計劃的實施細則。十月，香港合資格銀行開始與內地合作銀行共同提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為主要離岸人民幣中心的作用，香港金融管理局（HKMA）、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（HKEX）組成工作小組，進行可行性研究，探討在香港推廣人民幣計值股本證券交易。中國人民銀行（PBoC）與香港金融管理局於十二月聯合舉辦研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領先人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局持續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為進一步提高香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業界攜手合作，致力為基金成立提供更具利的稅務及監管環境。此外，在提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心，以及債券發行中心的地位方面，亦取得顯著進展。與此同時，金管局亦積極拓展市場推廣，向海外及內地各界介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，對維持香港作為國際金融中心的領先地位至關重要。二零二一年，四個銀行間實時總額結算系統（RTGS）、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易所結算所均實現百分之百系統可用性，超越目標的百分之九十九點九五。隨著九月南向債券通的推出，中央貨幣市場單位成為北向及南向債券通項下交易的結算及保管服務提供者。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）的使用於2021年持續擴展。截至2021年底，註冊用戶數已達960萬人，全年平均每日交易額較2020年提升90%。 促使交易量持續增長的主要因素包括：政府帳單的繳納、商戶付款以及為儲值服務（SVF）電子錢包或銀行帳戶充值的需求增加，加上個人對個人和企業間支付的穩定成長。\n\n為提升本地零售支付行業的安全及效率，香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具設施條例》監察六個指定零售支付系統，並監理十五間持牌儲值支付工具營運者。本年度，金管局協調各相關政府部門與獲委任參與消費券計劃的儲值支付工具營運者之間的對話與合作，以順利推行政府消費券計劃。\n\n2022年1月，香港金融管理局發佈了一份關於加密資產及穩定幣的討論文件，闡述了金管局對相關監管框架的看法，並邀請利益相關者提供意見。在制定適當的監管框架時，將會考慮相關因素，包括對此討論文件的意見以及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局是中央銀行界積極的成員，在多個區域及國際委員會中扮演領導角色。例如，香港金融管理局主持東亞太平洋中央銀行高級別會議（EMEAP）轄下的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）。此外，香港金融管理局亦與其他機構共同領導巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（Basel Committee）的政策與標準小組、非銀行監測專家小組，以及金融穩定理事會（FSB）的金融創新網絡；並帶領團隊專研與金融指標過渡相關的監管議題。\n\n# 2021年回顧\n\n# 香港金融科技樞紐\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n六月，香港金融管理局發布《金融科技2025》策略，以推動香港金融科技發展。該策略旨在鼓勵金融界於二零二五年全面採用科技，並促進提供公平且高效的金融服務，以惠及香港市民和經濟。該策略的五大重點領域如下：\n\n各銀行擁抱金融科技\n為香港迎接央行數位貨幣時代做好準備\n構建新一代數據基礎設施\n擴展具備金融科技專業知識的人才隊伍\n以資金及政策扶持生態系統發展\n\n香港金融管理局的「金融科技2025」策略帶動香港金融科技的發展。\n\n# 銀行業金融科技的採用與發展\n\n為配合「金融科技2025」策略中「銀行業邁向金融科技」的倡議，香港金融管理局於2021年6月展開「科技基線評估」。此評估旨在協助香港金融管理局更深入了解銀行業的金融科技發展現況，並識別可能需要香港金融管理局提供支援的相關領域。所有於香港有重大業務的持牌銀行，均須於2021年底前提交為期三年的金融科技應用規劃。\n\n香港金融管理局今年繼續推行其為期兩年的路線圖，以促進香港銀行採用合規科技，並在其監管過程中融入科技，藉此提升效率及改善成效。詳情請參閱《銀行穩定性》章節第98頁。\n\n# 批發型中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局與泰國央行於2021年2月擴大聯合研究項目範圍，納入阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行及中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所參與。該項目隨後更名為「多央行數字貨幣橋（mBridge）」，並獲得國際清算銀行（BIS）香港創新中心的大力支持，旨在進一步探討分布式賬本技術在多司法管轄區環境下，促進24\/7全天候即時跨境外匯支付對沖（PvP）交易。項目於9月發布聯合報告，公布中期研究成果，並於11月發布潛在應用場景及未來發展路線圖。\n\n# 零售型中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在零售央行數字貨幣（CBDC）的發展中保持領先地位，香港金融管理局已展開研究，探討在香港發行零售CBDC（即電子港元）的前景，涵蓋技術及政策方面的考慮。為深入探討發行零售CBDC的技術可行性，香港金融管理局與銀行國際結算中心（BIS）在香港的創新中心合作，啟動名為「Aurum項目」的研究。同時，金管局亦成立跨部門工作小組，專門研究相關的技術、政策及法律議題。今年十月，金管局發布了一份技術白皮書，題為《電子港元：技術視角》，旨在探討並徵求公眾對發行及分發零售CBDC潛在技術設計方案的意見。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局支持中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所，就利用電子人民幣進行跨境支付的技術試點合作。此舉有助於促進大灣區互聯互通，並透過提升跨境支付的效率及使用者體驗，為香港及內地旅客帶來更大便利。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n七月，香港金融管理局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行及穩定幣發行商加入CDI（下一代金融數據基礎設施），以提升銀行體系內金融中介效率。為進一步推動CDI的發展與應用，金融管理局於研討會上宣布啟動CDI創新中心。為促進中小企業融資，香港金融管理局已完成兩階段的概念驗證研究，評估CDI的技術可行性。透過應用替代數據輔助信貸評估及貸款承銷，參與銀行在研究期間已批准超過550筆中小企業貸款，總額逾9億港元。基於積極成果，香港金融管理局於十一月宣布CDI試點計劃正式啟動。\n\n中小企業主讚揚CDI簡化貸款申請程序。\n\n# 人才培育\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局與其策略夥伴持續合作，推行「金融科技職業加速器計劃2.0」，以培育各階段的年輕人才。二零二一年，共有超過一百八十名學生受惠於此計劃。另於同年九月，試辦「產業專案碩士網絡計劃」，為修讀金融科技專業的碩士學生提供參與實際金融科技專案的機會。為建立策略合作夥伴關係，並促進金融科技人才發展等領域的合作，香港金融管理局於十月與四所本地大學簽訂諒解備忘錄。\n\n香港金融管理局財務基建執行總監 Colin Pou（中）於與四所本地大學簽署諒解備忘錄儀式上。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）的使用量在本年度持續上升。截至2021年12月底，自2016年推出以來，FSS已批准234項金融科技試點計劃，較2020年底的193項增加。截至2021年12月底，香港金融管理局亦已收到666宗申請，希望透過2017年推出的FSS Chatroom，在金融科技項目初期階段獲取監管意見。其中超過63%的Chatroom申請來自科技公司。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.

Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response.

{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n","zh":"# 永續性\n\n香港金融管理局現將首份可持續發展報告納入《2021年年度報告》之中，以闡明其可持續發展策略，記錄自身在相關領域的推進工作，以及與金融業界攜手合作，支持政府氣候變遷策略，並為構建更具氣候韌性及可持續性的世界貢獻力量。\n\n香港金融管理局在其主要職能和角色中，將可持續性原則貫穿其中，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，抑或維持金融及貨幣穩定。此外，香港金融管理局亦與本地及海外對應機構合作，加強氣候風險的管理與披露，並推動綠色及可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局致力履行企業社會責任，並以成為負責任且可持續發展的機構為目標。這種承諾體現在多個方面，包括促進可持續、普惠金融和環保的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境以及營造關懷的職場。\n\n# 概述\n\n氣候變遷是當今世界面臨的最迫切挑戰之一。為了應對氣候變遷，各國在《巴黎協定》中同意採取行動，以減少溫室氣體排放，並在本世紀內最終實現碳中和。實現《巴黎協定》的氣候目標，預計全球每年將需要投資約 1 至 2 萬億美元，使永續發展成為未來數十年資本流動的主要驅動力。\n\n香港致力於成為這項轉型的領先者。政府宣布將努力在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球發達經濟體保持一致。香港亦是首個承諾於2025年前，在相關行業將披露要求與氣候相關財務資訊揭露工作小組（TCFD）的建議對齊的亞洲地區。\n\n對金融業而言，氣候變遷既是風險，亦是機遇。金融業雖難以置身事外於氣候變遷帶來的威脅，但在推動轉型方面卻扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金投入符合低碳排放路徑及具備氣候適應性的發展項目，以促進永續發展。\n\n香港金融管理局致力強化香港的金融體系，以支持更綠色和可持續的未來，推動各項行動支持政府的氣候目標，並貢獻於全球議程。為此，金管局在其主要職能和運作中融入可持續發展的考慮因素。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，香港金管局致力於加強銀行體系對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行支持向低碳經濟過渡的進程。為此，金管局已制定監管框架，明確銀行在管理及披露氣候風險方面的監管要求。此外，金管局於2021年已成功完成氣候風險壓力測試的試點計劃，以評估銀行業的韌性。同時，金管局持續將氣候變化計入監測金融穩定風險之中。\n\n其次，在市場發展方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正集中精力提升香港作為區域內，包括粵港澳大灣區的綠色和可持續金融中心地位。作為中國內地的離岸金融中心，香港具備良好條件，可引導全球投資支持內地實現二零三零年碳排放達峰及二零六零年碳中和目標。金管局亦透過其共同主持的綠色及可持續金融跨部門 steering group (CASG)³，致力提升業界能力、解決數據缺口，並探討建立本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融領域處於領先地位，率先推出全球首個政府主導的全球中期票據計劃，專門用於發行政府綠色債券，並自2019年起逐步擴大發行種類，包括不同貨幣和期限。為支持私營部門發行綠色及可持續債券和貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色及可持續金融資助計劃。此計劃由香港金融管理局管理，鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，並促進更多綠色顧問及外部審核機構在本地設立或擴大業務。\n\n第三，作為匯換基金的管理機構，香港金融管理局（香港金融管理局）已確保環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素是其投資流程和資產配置決策的重要組成部分。在本報告的後一部分，香港金融管理局將首次披露匯換基金投資組合的氣候情景分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，香港金融管理局正加強綠色辦公室行動，以確保其營運符合管理及減緩氣候風險的最佳實踐。作為首步，香港金融管理局已確立其範圍一及範圍二排放的碳足跡，並據此進行披露。同時，香港金融管理局已採取措施提升行業運作效率，並減少資源消耗。此外，香港金融管理局致力履行企業社會責任，並與各利益相關者合作，促進金融普及及提升金融素養。\n\n將金融體系轉向綠色金融需要中央銀行與監管機構的密切合作。香港金融管理局積極參與國際社會的全球政策制定及可持續發展標準的協調工作，並支持「綠色金融體系中央銀行與監管機構網絡」（NGFS）的格拉斯哥宣言⁵，重申致力落實 NGFS 建議，以促進更綠色的金融體系發展。\n\n為推動永續發展，並評估與氣候相關的機遇與風險，香港金融管理局已將永續發展及環保考量融入其管治和風險管理框架。領導層積極參與設定整體目標與指導原則，並諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其轄下委員會的意見。香港金融管理局的企業社會責任及永續發展委員會（CSC）亦會評估永續發展及氣候相關議題對機構的潛在影響，並制定策略以減輕這些影響。相關策略和行動的執行情況會受到密切監察，並定期向高層管理層匯報。此外，香港金融管理局已委聘外部顧問，就特定工作範疇提供專業意見。\n\n本章後續章節將深入探討香港金融管理局（HKMA）在履行其各項職能時，在綠色金融及可持續發展方面的治理架構、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參考二零二一年十二月發布的網絡綠色金融工作小組（NGFS）《中央銀行氣候相關披露指南》中建議的披露要素。 此外，香港金融管理局辦公室的營運資訊，主要參照全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準下的報告原則，以及香港交易所有限公司頒布的《環境、社會及管治報告指引》。\n\n# 中央銀行及監管機構綠色金融體系網絡\n\n網路零碳金融工作小組（NGFS）為全球中央銀行與審慎監管機構提供一個交流經驗、分享最佳實踐，推動金融部門環境與氣候風險管理發展，並動員主流金融資源以支持經濟轉型至永續發展的平台。 其目的在於界定並推廣最佳實踐，無論成員機構內外皆可應用，並執行或委託有關綠色金融的分析研究。\n\n# 氣候相關財務披露工作小組\n\n二零一五年十二月，金融穩定理事會（FSB）成立氣候相關財務披露工作小組（TCFD），旨在制定建議，協助企業更有效地向投資者、貸款人及保險承保人披露與氣候相關的財務資訊，藉此促進其做出更明智的決策。 TCFD的建議架構建立於四個主題領域，這些領域涵蓋組織運作的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理以及指標與目標。\n\n# 銀行業監管專員\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應積極管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資本引導至綠色及可持續活動。作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（金管局）專注於提升銀行抵禦氣候風險的韌性，並加速銀行支持向低碳經濟轉型的努力。\n\n# 香港金融管理局三階段方法概覽\n\n自2019年5月以來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直推動綠色和可持續銀行業務，分三個階段：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n建立一套共同的評估框架，以評估各銀行「綠色基線」水平，並與國際機構合作，為香港銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二期\n\n就綠色及永續銀行業的監管期望與要求，諮詢業界及其他利害關係人。\n\n# 第三階段\n\n聚焦於落實監管要求，並監測與評估銀行在綠色及永續金融方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管規範\n\n2020年，香港金融管理局與業界合作，制定了一套評估各銀行「綠色基準」的通用框架。香港金融管理局亦完成了首次銀行綠色評估，標誌第一階段的完成。為協助銀行準備新的監管要求，香港金融管理局於2020年6月發表一份白皮書，概述其對氣候風險管理監管預期的初步想法。\n\n於二零二一年十二月，香港金融管理局在聽取業界意見後，發佈銀行監管要求，將氣候相關考量納入治理、策略、風險管理及資訊披露。 尤其，根據TCFD建議，銀行須於不遲於二零二五年前，按照相關指引進行氣候相關資訊披露，並已訂明具體要求及時間表。 這些要求將確立銀行提升風險管理能力的基準。\n\n下一步是香港金融管理局監察銀行落實相關條款。為此，香港金融管理局已強化銀行監管部的監管能力，並在其內成立專責小組，以執行氣候風險監管工作。\n\n此三階段方法為一項迭代且不斷演進的過程。繼2020年進行的首次綠色評估後，香港金融管理局正檢視該框架，以涵蓋新的氣候風險管理監管要求，並可能擴大範圍至其他環境風險以及支持淨零轉型的措施。香港金融管理局計劃於2022年下半年推出更新後的框架。\n\n# 助力邁向碳中和的健全做法\n\n除了將氣候風險納入風險管理架構外，部分銀行已投入資源並採取措施，支持《巴黎協議》的目標，助力實現全球淨零排放。香港金融管理局於2021年12月發出通函，與業界分享這些銀行的良好實踐，供業界其他銀行制定氣候策略時參考。這些良好實踐歸納為四大範疇：減少銀行自身營運的溫室氣體排放、透過投資組合導向策略降低融資排放、協助客戶轉型，以及推動集體行動以協助經濟實現淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類架構以引導綠色金融流動。\n\n為提升金融市場透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的協調一致，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正與其他金融監管機構合作，研擬本地綠色分類框架，以協助金融業界更易於理解並應用國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）制定的《共識分類法》（Common Ground Taxonomy，簡稱CGT）以及中國和歐盟採用的綠色定義。此項工作將以互通性、可比性及包容性為原則，並充分考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地情況。此舉有助於降低綠色洗白風險，提升產品可比性，並最終加強投資者保障。\n\n# 氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化所帶來的潛在衝擊，香港金融管理局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）演練，計有20間主要零售銀行及七家國際銀行集團分行參與。香港金融管理局於2021年12月發布相關演練結果報告。結果顯示，即使面對極端氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍能有效應對，但這些衝擊仍可能對銀行財務狀況造成重大不利影響。本次CRST演練有助提升銀行測量及評估氣候風險的能力。根據演練結果，參與銀行已制定計劃以強化氣候策略及風險治理框架。香港金融管理局將持續與業界合作，提升銀行相關能力並完善CRST框架，並吸取本次演練的經驗教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit\n","zh":"# 匯儲基金\n\n審計署署長關於交換基金財務報表的報告\n\n# 審計署 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 致財政司長的獨立核數師報告\n\n# 觀點\n\n我證明我已審計交換基金及其附屬機構（「該集團」）所載於第217至319頁的財務報表，包括交換基金及該集團於2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入支出表、綜合損益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，截至二零二一年十二月三十一日，財務報表真實且公允地反映了基金及集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現與現金流量。此等財務報表乃根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並已依照根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官發出的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見依據\n\n我遵照根據《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，以及審計署的審計準則執行審計。我於報告內的「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一段，進一步闡述了根據該等準則所應負的責任。我與本集團保持獨立，並已完全履行了該等準則所規定的其他專業道德義務。我相信我所取得的審計證據充分且適當，足以為我的審計意見提供可靠依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指在我對截至2021年12月31日止年度財務報表進行審計時，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。這些事項在整體財務報表審計的過程中已獲處理，並構成我形成審計意見的基礎。我並未就此另行發表意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債之公允價值計量\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總額為港幣4,502,475億元，金融負債總額為港幣1,150,861億元，均按公允價值計量。\n\n這類金融資產和金融負債中，89% 的公允價值來自於活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一等級輸入），其餘則使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術估算（第二等級輸入）。\n\n對於其餘11%的金融資產，其公允價值乃採用估值技術，並以非可觀察市場數據為輸入（第三層輸入）估計。 這些金融資產總額為港幣5173.16億元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於金額重大且涉及複雜估計，金融資產和金融負債按公允價值計量為關鍵審計事項。\n\n財務資產及金融負債以公允價值計量之審計程序包括：\n\n取得對不同類別金融資產及金融負債估值程序（包括相關控制措施）的了解；\n評估及測試相關控制措施，包括電腦系統之相關應用控制；\n就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在性、權利義務及完整性取得外部確認；\n如使用報價市場價格，則驗證價格是否來自獨立來源；\n如使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並驗證輸入數據是否來自獨立來源；以及\n如使用非以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設與輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表的附註2.11、18及19。\n\n本集團的投資物業按公允價值列賬，截至2021年12月31日總額為270.89億港元。本集團亦於一家聯營公司及二十一家合營企業中擁有權益，總額為451.72億港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由本集團直接持有、聯營公司或合營企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。 該等估值涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所用假設。\n\n針對投資性不動產公允價值衡量的審計程序包括：\n\n取得並審閱本集團直接持有或透過聯營公司或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並確認公允價值乃根據估值報告中所載的評估結果釐定；評估估值師的獨立性及資格；及評估估值方法的適當性與假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他內容。 該等內容包括香港金融管理局2021年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及其審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見僅限於財務報表，並不涵蓋其他資訊，且對此類資訊不表達任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估其是否與財務報表或我審計過程中所得知的資訊存在重大不一致，或有重大錯誤陳述。若經我執行相關工作後，認為該等資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我須據實報告。現無須報告事項。\n\n# 香港外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣當局及審計小組對財務報表的職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，編製真實且公允的財務報表，並為此建立必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營能力，在適用情況下披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營會計。\n\n結匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監理本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的職責\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以評估財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，不論該等錯誤陳述是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並發出包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證代表高度的信心，但並非保證，即使依照審計準則進行審計，亦無法確保能偵出所有存在的重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若其單獨或彙總效應合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n作為審計總署審計準則的審計一部分，我會審慎判斷，並於審計過程中保持警惕。此外，我：\n\n識別並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，不論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，設計及執行相應的審計程序，並獲取充分且適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的依據。因舞弊而導致的重大錯誤陳述未被發現的風險，高於因錯誤而導致的風險，因為舞弊可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n瞭解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計適於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n評估所使用的會計政策的適當性，以及貨幣管理局所作的會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n對貨幣管理局採用持續經營會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大不確定性的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我需要於審計報告中引起注意財務報表中的相關披露，或者，如果該等披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計報告日所獲取的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致本集團停止持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體列報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現的方式反映其基礎交易和事件；及\n獲取關於本集團內實體或業務活動的充分適當審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的方向、監督和執行。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組就審計的預計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷進行溝通。\n\n我亦向外匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向彼等披露所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組的溝通，我確定本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，並將其列為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項可能造成的負面影響，合理預期將高於其對公共利益的效益，否則我將在審計師報告中予以說明。\n\n約翰·朱 審計主任\n"}
