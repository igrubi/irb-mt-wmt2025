{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","zh":"# 2015年亮點\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求減弱及出口表現欠佳。本地股市受全球金融市場波動影響，出現大幅震盪。住宅物業市場在二月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始趨緩。\n\n香港銀行業具韌性。本地註冊的持牌金融機構（AIs）資本充足，其流動性狀況持續穩健。零售銀行的資產質素略有下降，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n港元兌美元匯率大致維持穩定，今年四月、九月及十月多次觸發強方兌換承諾。儘管全球金融市場波動，港元匯率市場仍有序運作，充分展現聯繫匯率制度抵禦外部衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。繼美國聯邦儲備系統決定提高聯邦基金利率目標範圍後，香港基準利率於12月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n對人工智慧的風險治理監督措施已加強，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資和保險產品的銷售行為。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布在香港實施逆周期資本緩衝，並指定五間獲授權機構為本地系統重要性銀行。為建立香港金融機構的決議機制，以及加快存款保障計劃的賠付速度，相關立法建議已分別提交立法會。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。為改善稅務環境以促進香港發展成為企業財務中心，相關立法建議已於12月呈交立法會。\n\n香港仍然是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，擁有廣闊且完善的市場。內地與香港基金互認安排已於七月實施，進一步擴展香港的人民幣產品服務。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施因十二月成功推出e-支票服務而進一步提升，讓客戶可網上簽發及存入支票。一套新的監管制度於十一月開始運作，為多用途儲值機構發牌並指定重要的零售支付系統。\n\n# 儲備管理\n在充滿挑戰的投資環境下，外匯基金錄得整體投資回報為負0.6%。截至2015年底，基金總資產達到港幣3,422.9億元。\n\n香港金融管理局加快投資多元化，特別透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）的投資。截至2015年底，LTGP投資組合的總市值達1421億港元，其中私募股權投資為913億港元，房地產投資為508億港元，尚有1224億港元的投資承諾未到位。\n\n# 公司職務\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策和運作的理解。為提升企業管治水平，管理局致力支持員工專業發展，嚴守財務紀律，加強資訊安全，並重新協調高級管理層的職責，以應對新措施推行及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟金融局勢\n\n香港經濟在2015年增長放緩，反映內需較弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長將維持偏弱的趨勢，並受到嚴峻的外部挑戰和金融市場不穩定因素的影響。\n\n# 經濟概況\n\n# 概述\n\n香港經濟於本年度增長放緩，實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長由2014年的2.6% 降至2.4%（表1）。這反映內需增長較為溫和，但淨出口轉為對GDP增長的貢獻，原因是總進口下降速度快於總出口（圖1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞動力市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低位。由於本地成本和進口價格的壓力減退，通脹進一步緩和。本地股市在環球金融市場波動加劇的情況下，出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月份公布第七輪審慎措施後開始降溫，房屋價格在年底進一步顯示出盤整跡象。\n\n圖表 1 實際國內生產總值各項貢獻\n資料來源：統計處\n\n表一 實質GDP按支出項目增長率（環比）\n\n注意：經季節性調整的固定資本形成總額季度對季度變動率目前不可用。\n來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟金融局勢\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年港元匯率保持穩定，並維持在約7.75美元水平。由於股權資金流入，4月觸發了強方兌換保證，9月及10月再次因離岸人民幣兌換港元及部分商業需求而觸發。 隨着總結餘擴大，本地利率維持低水平，而香港金融管理局基礎利率在12月中美國加息後，由0.5%調升至0.75%。 由於信貸需求減弱，銀行業總貸款增長放緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降。 銀行業整體貸款質素略有惡化，但不良貸款比率仍維持低水平。\n\n# 國內需求\n\n二零一五年，國內需求增長趨緩。儘管就業與所得狀況維持穩定，持續提供支撐，但消費者信心疲軟及資產價格修正，對下半年私人消費造成抑制。然而，受益於上半年強勁的增長動能，全年私人消費增長率由二零一四年的3.3%提升至4.8%。政府消費增長率為3.4%，略高於私人消費。事實上，國內需求增長放緩主要源於總體固定資本形成減少2.2%（圖2）。私人部門機械設備投資連續第二年下滑，反映出商業信心轉弱，同時建築與工程活動亦因公共工程進度延緩而動能減弱。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年轉趨疲軟（圖3）。商品出口整體下跌1.7%，為自2009年以來的首次負增長。對日本及歐盟的出口均呈下降趨勢，而對美國的出口增長則微乎其微。這些已開發市場的最終需求疲弱，亦對區域內的工業活動和貿易造成不利影響。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣的出口亦隨之下降，原因是這些經濟體的中間需求和最終需求均顯著減弱。香港的服務出口在過去數年維持高速增長後，於2015年增速放緩，並錄得0.6%的跌幅，主要受到入境旅遊人數減少的影響。與此同時，商品進口亦因內需和出口需求的雙重疲軟而下降。然而，本地居民的旅遊意願強勁帶動了服務進口的增長。綜合來看，2015年香港的貿易順差略有擴大，為GDP增長帶來了溫和的正面效益。\n\n圖表 2 國內需求\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 物價膨脹\n\n2015年，核心通脹進一步緩和，主要受到本地成本壓力減輕及進口物價通脹下降的影響。扣除政府一次性紓緩措施後，核心通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（見圖4）。在經濟活動趨於平穩的背景下，勞工成本壓力保持穩定，而商業及工業物業租賃成本壓力則有所緩解，尤其是在下半年。由於全球大宗商品價格回落及港元保持強勁，進口物價壓力減輕，食品通脹亦維持低位。由於較早季度新租賃住宅租金的傳導效應溫和，通脹中的租金組成部分受到有效控制。\n\n圖表 3 商品及服務出口\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n圖4 核心消費者物價通脹\n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟金融局勢\n\n# 就業市場\n\n2015年勞動市場狀況保持穩定。 勞動需求維持強勁，儘管貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業人數略有減少，但其他行業的聘用增加有效彌補了這部分降幅，使總體就業人數較去年增加1.3%。 勞動力供應亦增長1.3%，經季節調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3% (圖表5)。 由於勞動市場依然供不應求，今年首季名義工資較去年同期上漲4.7%，高於2014年的4.3%。 隨著通脹壓力減緩，今年首季實際工資增長1.3%，而2014年同期則為下降0.1%。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在外部環境劇烈變動下，經歷了一年波動。年初首季表現平穩，隨後在第二季因內地A股市場的樂觀氣氛及資金流入而走高。恒生指數在四月一度升至七年高位，滬港通南向交易每日額度自2014年11月開通以來首次全數用罄（見圖6）。然而，自六月底起，本地市場趨勢逆轉，受內地A股市場及全球股市的拋售、全球外匯市場波動加劇以及國際商品價格下跌等因素影響，恒生指數在九月跌至年內低點，跌幅達28%。隨著全球及內地金融市場穩定，香港股市在第四季有所回升。整體而言，2015年恒生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而平均每日成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。儘管下半年集資活動有所放緩，但本地股市集資的整體股本金額仍由前一年的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅房地產市場出現盤整跡象。在2015年初經歷一段活躍期後，隨着二月份公布第七輪審慎措施，市場隨後趨於降溫。儘管房價在去年第四季增長速度放緩並開始下跌，但2015年全年房價累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。與去年同期相比，交易量減少12.3%，降至55,982個單位，主要原因是下半年二手市場的交易活動明顯減少。投機性交易，包括確認交易和短期炒房，持續保持低水平。儘管如此，家庭購房負擔依然沉重，房屋價格與收入比達到15.7，收入負擔比率也遠高於長期平均水準。商業及工業物業市場上半年表現強勁，但其後交易活動趨緩，去年第四季的價格和租金均出現下跌。租金回報率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖表六 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 經濟金融局勢\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2016年的經濟增長預料將維持偏緩步勢。私人機構分析師預測經濟平均增長率將放緩至1.7%，而政府則預測增長幅度介乎1%至2%之間。更具體而言，全球經濟前景不明朗、訪港旅遊持續低迷，以及全球金融市場波動所帶來的負面影響，將繼續制約香港出口表現。本地方面，預期私人消費將溫和增長，但勞動市場或因經濟動能減弱而面臨壓力，本地資產價格調整亦可能削弱消費者信心，進而引發負面財富效應。儘管建築及工程活動或能保持穩定，但疲弱的商業氣氛和利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 物價膨脹與勞工市場\n\n預計2016年通膨壓力將維持在可控水準。進口物價壓力預料將保持平穩，而國內成本壓力在溫和的經濟成長動能支撐下，預期亦將維持溫和。由於2015年底新建租屋市場的租金壓力趨於緩解，通膨結構中的租金項目也可能隨之下降。市場普遍預測2016年整體通膨率為2.5%，政府則預估核心通膨率為2.0%。受入境旅遊趨緩及出口持續疲弱影響，勞動市場可能略有鬆動。私人部門分析師目前預測2016年失業率將升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定因素與風險\n\n二零一六年經濟前景存在若干不確定性及風險。特別是美國利率進一步升息的步伐、全球經濟增長狀況以及商品價格走勢，將持續構成主要的不確定因素。任何重大的不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場和國際資本流動的波動，進而收緊本地貨幣及金融環境，並對香港的經濟增長前景造成影響。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響程度，將取決於其透過財富效應和資產負債表效應對房地產市場的影響。儘管房地產市場正面臨全球及本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及房屋供需缺口收窄等多重下行風險，但仍需時間觀察市場是否已進入下行週期。雖然房地產市場的急劇調整可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但過去幾年實施的逆週期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施已顯著提升香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在本年度仍保持穩健，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體的風險不斷累積。獲授權機構的流動性狀況持續保持良好，而本地註冊的獲授權機構則資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略為下降，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n與美元利率同步，港元銀行間利率全年維持低位。零售銀行的港元融資成本上半年隨綜合利率走勢下行，下半年則保持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖表7 HIBOR定盤利率、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）\n註：\n1.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管2015年金融市場動盪，且美國於十二月加息，港元匯率整體仍保持穩定。資金市場運作正常，銀行體系間流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度作為過去數十年香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，持續展現高度韌性，有效抵禦外部衝擊。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定定義為港元於外匯市場對美元的匯率，維持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元之間。貨幣體系的結構以貨幣發行局制度為特色，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有100%的美元儲備於匯基金作支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動均須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表1）由以下各項組成。\n\n債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供十足擔保。\n政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣。\n結算餘額，即銀行於香港金融管理局持有的結算戶餘額總和。\n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及紙幣。\n\n香港特區的港元匯率穩定，仰賴自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）。當市場上對港元的需求超過供應，匯率升至強方承諾水平每美元7.75港元時，金管局會即時向銀行出售港元，以換取美元。此舉將增加總結餘，壓低港元利率，從而促使匯率由強方水平回落至7.75至7.85港元的兌換區間內。反之，若港元供應過多，需求不足，匯率跌至弱方承諾水平每美元7.85港元時，金管局則會向銀行買入港元。此舉將減少總結餘，提高港元利率，使匯率由弱方水平回升，維持在兌換區間之內。\n\n本處所列的債務證書以及流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣，均以港幣面值列示。匯兌基金的資產負債表所載的相關項目，以相當於其贖回所需美元金額的港幣計值，並按資產負債表日的匯率換算。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\n於本報告中所示的EFBN金額，與交換基金在本年度報告中的資產負債表所列金額有所不同。 根據香港公認會計原則，香港金融管理局代表交換基金在二級市場交易EFBN所持有的EFBN，將與已發行的EFBN沖抵，並將淨額記錄在資產負債表中。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2015年，港元兌美元匯率大致穩定，於7.7500至7.7657之間窄幅波動（見圖1）。年初時，市場對美國加息的擔憂一度令港元承受輕微貶值壓力。然而，第二季港元匯率回升至接近7.75水平，主要由於股市活躍，帶動股權相關的港元需求增加，4月強方觸發機制因而多次被觸發。進入下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著沽售，全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動加劇，港元兌美元匯率在8月仍維持於接近7.75水平。9月及10月，受離岸人民幣兌換成港元的影響，強方觸發機制再次被觸發。美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調25個基點，但港元兌美元匯率仍維持於窄幅區間內波動，資金外流壓力不明顯。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場動盪，2015年港元匯市運作保持有序。\n\n圖表1：2015年市場匯率\n\n由於強方兌換觸發在四月、九月及十月多次出現，香港金融管理局根據貨幣發行局原則，被動地從銀行購入總額293億美元，並兌換了2,272億港元。此舉導致總結餘相應擴大，部分擴大因應銀行對流動性管理的強勁需求，透過額外發行發鈔基金債券及發鈔基金紙幣來抵銷（圖2）。額外發行發鈔基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這代表貨幣基礎的組成部分發生變化，而貨幣基礎完全以外匯儲備支持。截至2015年底，總結餘與未償發鈔基金債券及紙幣的總額增至1,221.0億港元，較一年前的992.5億港元為高。\n\n圖表 2：二零一五年結餘及未償還之交換基金票據總額\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在銀行體系充裕的流動資金支持下，2015年香港銀行同業利率維持低位。美國聯邦基金利率目標區間於12月16日（美國時間）由0–0.25%調升至0.25–0.5%，隨之香港銀行利率亦根據預設公式於12月17日由0.5%調升至0.75%。2015年整體而言，隔夜至三個月期的銀行同業利率均低於基準利率（見圖3），其波動主要受到銀行季節性資金需求，以及8月金融市場動盪導致流動性收緊的影響。香港元遠期點數大致沿著香港銀行同業拆息率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息率（LIBOR）的利差走勢，8月因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著升水，其後因美國利率普遍上漲而於年底轉為貼水（見圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場運作正常，再貼現窗口借款活動甚少，2015年總額僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖表三：二零一五年港幣銀行同業利率\n\n圖表4 2015年港元遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直運作暢順，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重要貢獻。鑒於香港經濟體規模細小且具開放性，以及其作為國際金融中心的地位，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定致力於維持聯繫匯率制度。實際上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，公眾對港元作為支付工具及價值儲存的信心依然強烈。在2015年國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）對香港的第四條諮詢中，IMF繼續肯定聯繫匯率制度是香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局持續密切監察銀行在信貸、流動性及利率風險管理方面的表現，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管力度，以提升銀行業的抗風險能力。 鑒於美國利率上升，香港金融管理局提醒公眾做好風險管理的必要準備，並指出觸發聯繫匯率制度的弱方兌換機制及港元資金外流，是港元利率正常化的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高外匯基金帳戶的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分撥作支持貨幣基礎。二零一五年，後備比率（定義為後備資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3%至107.5%的窄幅區間內，並未觸及上下限觸發水平。截至十二月三十一日，該比率收報106.3%（見圖表5）。根據《聯繫匯率制度》，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為後備組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可動用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財務資源為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強有力的後盾，以應對突發衝擊。\n\n圖5 2015年Backing Ratio每日波動\n\n# 其他活動項目\n\n香港金融管理局結匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行局小組委員會負責監察及審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。二零一五年，該小組委員會審議的議題包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應情況、國際宏觀審慎措施的應用、美國加息對香港房地產市場的影響、基礎利率的慗定機制、港元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。該小組委員會的討論記錄和提交予該小組委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告均已在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）繼續資助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。二零一五年，該學院接待了十六位研究員，並發表了二十七篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議與研討會：\n\n一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟研討會，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。研討會發表了十一篇高品質的研究論文，內容涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸擴張與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等廣泛議題。\n五月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦了「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、制度與經濟增長研討會」，探討了銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場等多項經濟議題。\n十月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦了「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」研討會。會議深入探討了貨幣政策、國際資本流動與匯率之間的關係，分歧的貨幣政策對全球金融穩定的影響，主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等議題。\n\n香港金融管理局研究局於八月舉辦了第十三屆夏季研討營，並於九月舉辦了第十三屆內地經濟研討會，探討中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。研討營及研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業和全球中央銀行的參與者。此外，該局在當年共舉辦了二十四場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通銀行券總值為3602億港元，較一年前增加5.3%（圖表6、7及8）。政府發行紙幣及硬幣的總值為112億港元，上升2.9%（圖表9及10）。其中，政府發行的10港元紙幣流通總值為40億港元，85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將監管重點放在授權機構的風險管治上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理體系、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售實務。隨著系統性風險的累積，金管局宣布自2016年1月1日起，香港實施0.625%的逆週期資本緩衝比率（並於2017年1月1日起提高至1.25%）。五家授權機構被指定為系統重要性銀行，將需遵守較高的資本吸收能力緩衝。在《金融機構（解決）條例草案》提交立法會後，復原及解決機制改革取得重大進展。金管局亦加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融從業員的技能和知識發展。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的情況下，新興市場於2015年面臨較高的資本外流風險及經濟增長放緩。為維持銀行體系在宏觀經濟環境可能急劇惡化的狀況下的韌性，香港金融管理局持續密切監察持牌金融機構的風險治理及其信貸和流動性風險管理系統的有效性。\n\n# 運作監督\n\n二零一五年，香港金融管理局繼續採取監管方式，透過定期現場檢查，並輔以增加主題性審查。主題性審查是對選定持牌金融機構的特定風險領域或業務活動進行深入的非現場評估。這種做法使香港金融管理局能夠更有效地運用監管資源，專注於持牌金融機構所面臨的新興及重大風險。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局共進行了193次現場檢查。鑑於金融機構貸款組合的資產質量出現惡化跡象，金融管理局加強了對信貸風險管理及資產質素的主題性深入現場檢查。此外，考慮到主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分歧導致市場不確定性增加，金融管理局亦增加了對與庫務相關活動的檢查次數。檢查範圍亦涵蓋與內地業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，以及金融機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型。本年度，專門團隊亦對金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，其覆蓋範圍與主題性現場檢查相似。表1詳列了營運監管工作的資料。\n\n2015年，共進行了196次非現場審查，以評估金融機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務經營情況。監管重點包括風險治理、資本規劃、企業信貸以及巴塞爾III標準的落實監督。監管團隊與所選金融機構的董事會及外部審計師保持密切聯繫。與金融機構高層管理人員及外部審計師召開了20次三方會議，並與所選金融機構的董事會或委員會舉行了23次會議。\n\n銀行監管審查委員會審議了四宗案件，均涉及人工智能的授權事宜。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以處理多項競爭優先事項，香港金融管理局持續根據《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求持牌銀行委任外部審計師跟進可能對監管構成重大影響的問題。香港金融管理局於2015年根據此條款委託了六份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢／反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，另外兩份報告則涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，沒有任何持牌金融機構違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動比率的規定。雖然出現了84宗違反《銀行條例》各項條文的個案，但這些個案均未損害存款人的權益，並已由持牌金融機構及時糾正。\n\n表一 運作管理\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條賦予之權力\n\n美利銀行有限公司繼續受《銀行條例》第52條賦予的權力規管。 貨幣管理局於2008年6月25日根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條，對美利銀行有限公司香港分行的事務、業務及財產發出的指示，在本年度內仍然有效。香港金融管理局將繼續與有關當局保持定期溝通，以監察該分行及其英國總行的發展情況，並密切留意已採取的監管措施，以保障持牌金融機構存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL 評級審查\n\nCAMEL核准委員會審查並確定各金融機構的綜合CAMEL評分。各金融機構已獲告知評分結果，並給予要求覆審的機會。本年度並無任何機構提出覆審申請。\n\n# 專業性監督工作\n\n# 營運及科技風險監控\n\n香港金融管理局持續發布有關營運及科技風險管理的新指引或更新，以應對新興風險及行業發展。尤其，金管局已完成修訂《監察政策手冊》（SPM）中與電子銀行（e-banking）相關的章節，賦予認可機構在提供新的電子銀行服務方面更大的自主權。此外，金管局發佈了一份關於網絡安全的通函，重申董事會及認可機構高層管理人員對有效網絡安全風險管理進行監察的重要性。金管局亦定期發佈《營運事件通報》，重點介紹精選詐騙案件或營運事故的作案手法，以及所識別出的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局展開以風險為基礎的主題式現場及非現場監理檢視，以評估選定持牌機構在企業層面或特定業務範疇內的營運及科技風險管理。 這些檢視涵蓋持牌機構營運風險管理框架、網絡安全風險管理、防範違規交易的控制措施、重要外包服務供應商的監管、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢科技控制等相關範疇。 此外，年度獨立合規評審作為補充，覆蓋營運風險管理框架、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性規劃；選定持牌機構需委任獨立且具資格的評審人員，檢視其相關控制措施的充分性，並修復所發現的不足之處。 金融管理局亦會識別及分析持牌機構營運及科技風險的趨勢和監理重點，尤其關注於在維持香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的持牌機構。\n\n香港金融管理局監察銀行業界在二零一五年底完成以晶片為基礎的自動櫃員機技術的最後階段實施。透過此技術，發卡機構已完成純信用卡的換卡程序。香港金融管理局亦要求發卡機構實施認證控制措施，以進一步提升非接觸式信用卡交易的安全性。此外，在收到報告指部分非接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可能被暗中存取後，香港金融管理局要求相關發卡機構迅速採取行動，通知及保障受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局亦投入資源向公眾宣傳及解釋事件的規模和影響，以處理公眾疑慮，並監察發卡機構的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦公眾安全意識教育活動，建立網絡安全情報共享平台，以及為香港金融服務業務連續性管理論壇主辦的危機管理演習提供支持與協助，該演習涵蓋人工智能企業及其他金融機構。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金監察\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃的銷售提供指引並進行監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構理事會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議涵蓋金融服務業內業務關係密切的金融集團或持牌機構所涉及的各項議題，旨在確保監管行動更加協調和有效。\n\n本年度內，香港金融管理局對持牌金融機構進行了25項現場及非現場主題檢查，以及15項非現場監察。這些檢查涵蓋了投資產品銷售、處理證券交易結算及客戶證券的安全保管，以及涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品和強制性公積金（MPF）相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月份，香港金融管理局向認可機構發出通函，就向客戶銷售非保證投資連結保險（NLTI）產品的適合性評估和產品資料披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助認可機構遵守監管標準，包括保險事務專員公署和香港保險業聯會於七月份發出的相關規定。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與財經事務及庫務局密切合作，參與《2014年保險公司（修訂）條例》的立法程序，旨在設立獨立的保險業監管局，並為保險中介人實施法定牌照制度。2015年7月，立法會通過《2015年保險公司（修訂）條例》，其中規定授權金融管理局對保險中介人的保險中介活動進行檢查和調查。\n\n香港金融管理局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗由註冊機構提出的從事額外受規管活動的申請。管理局批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券業務的高級人員，並對註冊機構提交的9,697名人士進行背景審查，以納入香港金融管理局所維護的登記冊。\n\n# 財務監督\n\n香港金融管理局持續將持牌機構的流動性風險管理列為其監管重點之一，尤其是在預期美國利率正常化及隨後可能出現的資金流動逆轉，對持牌機構流動性狀況構成潛在影響的情況下。二零一五年全年，香港金融管理局繼續實施針對持牌機構的強化穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金支持貸款業務。自二零一五年一月一日起實施巴塞爾協議三的流動性覆蓋比率以來，香港金融管理局一直監測第一類機構的流動性覆蓋比率水平及趨勢。這些機構的流動性覆蓋比率普遍維持在百分之百或以上，遠高於二零一五年過渡期安排所規定的法定最低要求百分之六十。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（金管局）已對選定的認可金融機構的風險管理控制架構，就預期利率正常化相關風險進行主題性現場檢查。面對市場劇烈波動，金管局亦密切關注市場的快速變化及其對銀行業及個別認可金融機構的影響，並採取了必要的跟進措施。\n\n# 主管主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行自下而上的監管主導壓力測試計劃，以更深入了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟情況下的韌性，並鼓勵它們制定應對壓力情況的計劃。本年度引入多項改進措施，以收集更詳盡的資料，從而更深入掌握重點領域的風險動態。金管局分析了參與的認可機構提交的測試結果，並與它們探討如何進一步完善壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n自2015年下半年起，近年來觀測到的強勁信貸成長趨勢已趨緩。全年而言，銀行業總貸款額增長3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降（表2）。由於客戶存款成長速度高於銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率由去年的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n二零一五年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，亟需加強國際合作與溝通以維護穩定。年內，香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港強勁的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現持續獲得信用評級機構的認可，標準普爾亦維持香港的最高信用評級AAA。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際間關於全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題討論。今年七月，該局擔任亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）的共同主席，任期兩年。此小組旨在促進金融穩定理事會成員與非成員在政策倡議上的互動，鼓勵金融改革的落實，並促進金融穩定議題的觀點交流。香港金融管理局亦繼續與東盟加三機構緊密合作，加強東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作——該辦公室已升格為國際組織——以監測及分析區域經濟狀況，並協助清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策。\n\n本年，香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行額因多項市場因素而略有縮減。儘管如此，市場運作維持有序，人民幣貿易結算、銀行信貸及外匯交易額均保持穩定增長。此外，香港人民幣業務的發展，有助於國際貨幣基金組織確認人民幣為一種可自由使用的貨幣。國際貨幣基金組織將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子的決定，將進一步推動人民幣國際化，並促進香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作及其持續發展，對強化香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢至關重要。香港人民幣支付系統的交易額在二零一五年創下新高，而場外衍生工具交易報告庫亦持續支持各機構按照七月推出的新型場外衍生工具市場監管制度，申報其交易。\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年進一步加強香港的金融基礎設施，新增多項組件及服務，其中包括於12月成功推出電子支票服務，使超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及流動渠道為客戶接收及處理電子支票。2013年推出的電子帳單呈遞及支付（EBPP）服務在2015年持續擴展商戶參與度。同年7月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMu）在其資金訂單路由服務下推出新服務，支持內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）的實施。此外，11月起生效的《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）完善了零售支付產品及服務的監管框架。根據《PSSVFO》，香港金融管理局獲賦權對多用途儲值設施實施強制性牌照制度，並執行相關監管及執法職能，同時指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫日益緊密，香港金融管理局積極與其他司法管轄區合作，透過包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC）等國際及區域論壇，促進可持續經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦持續執行全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）區域諮詢小組（亞洲）（RCG(A)）的共同主席，並於十月在香港主辦該小組第九次會議。RCG(A)為FSB成員及非成員提供重要的溝通與合作平台，以探討金融穩定議題。來自亞洲十六個司法管轄區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高級代表出席會議，討論區內所面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險計劃的經驗。金管局亦於八月與全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）共同主辦一場有關香港宏觀審慎政策的研討會。該研討會吸引了來自世界各地十八個中央銀行的代表參與，與會者分享了宏觀審慎政策的經驗，重點關注政策工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及潛在的溢出效應。此外，金管局亦與英國央行及國際貨幣基金組織共同主辦一場會議，探討各國央行及其他政策制定者在選擇最佳貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了逾百名與會者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 推動亞洲金融及貨幣穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續致力於促進亞洲金融穩定，並在國際金融事務中發揮地區集體聲音。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行行長會議（EMEAP）轄下貨幣與金融穩定委員會的宏觀監測工作協調機構，金管局持續編製委員會的半年度《宏觀監測報告》，評估區內風險與脆弱性及其政策影響。同時，作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組的主席，金管局與副主席緊密合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準及最佳實務、以及國內和跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗交流與資訊共享。金管局亦領導該工作小組的跨境合作與發展子小組。六月，金管局在香港主辦了EMEAP\/BIS外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議。來自區內及主要經濟體的17個主管機構代表出席了會議，並審視了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革。\n\n在香港與東盟加三於去年簽署AMRO協議後，AMRO於二零一六年二月升格為國際組織，以支持其在強化區域貨幣互換機制下的關鍵作用。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局持續與國際信用評級機構保持緊密溝通，以提供香港經濟表現和財政實力的客觀評估。這些努力促成2015年各主要信用評級機構均確認香港的信用評級。標準普爾再次確認香港的最高AAA級評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體，其增長前景優於平均水平，擁有龐大的財政儲備，財政表現一直保持穩健，以及強勁的淨外部資產狀況。穆迪投資服務和惠譽評級機構亦分別維持香港的評級於Aa1和AA+，僅次於AAA級一個等級。\n\n# 香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務中心進程\n\n二零一五年，市場因素對香港的人民幣資金池產生影響。截至年底，人民幣客戶存款及存單餘額達1,010億元，較去年同期的1,158億元有所減少（圖1）。由於內地市場利率下降，離岸人民幣債券發行規模減緩，導致香港的人民幣債券發行量降至75億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增長9%，達到6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款餘額亦較去年同期增長58%，達297億元（圖2）。人民幣實時全額清算（RTGS）系統的日均交易額增至947億元，較2014年增長29%。與此同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步擴張，根據調查結果顯示，截至2015年4月底，日均交易額約為930億美元，較2013年4月上次BIS三年期調查時增長88%。香港仍然是最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，市場深度和廣度兼備。另一項強化此地位的重要發展是2015年7月推出的MRF計劃，進一步拓展了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局擴展跨境人民幣資金流動渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界攜手提升香港人民幣金融平台的努力，持續為香港帶來新的發展。今年六月，中國人民銀行宣布，離岸人民幣業務清算銀行及參與銀行可於內地銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得資金轉回離岸，以便利銀行進行人民幣流動性管理。九月，中國人民銀行進一步放寬跨境人民幣現金池管理規定，使更多跨國企業能夠在簡化安排下進行集團內部資金調撥。此外，內地當局於七月擴大外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金參與內地銀行間債券市場的准入，並於九月進一步開放內地外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n30日，國際貨幣基金組織宣布，自2016年10月1日起將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子。此舉肯定了人民幣作為一種可自由使用的貨幣地位，並進一步增強了國際社會對人民幣在全球交易中使用的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化以及中國大陸與全球經濟金融體系聯繫加強所帶來的全新商機中受惠。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務上的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同主辦第三屆人民幣貿易投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣商業論壇，並與馬來西亞及泰國再度合作，促進私營機構就人民幣業務展開交流。藉此，香港銀行加強了與其他市場的人民幣業務往來及聯繫，預期將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。此外，香港金融管理局積極拓展推廣工作，鼓勵企業和機構在貿易、投資及融資方面更廣泛使用人民幣，包括參與在香港及海外市場（例如加拿大、日本和非洲）的業界活動。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁岳家輝先生於2015年12月11日香港－倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間，在研討會上發言。\n\n# 《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》\n\n中國內地與香港於十一月在《更緊密經貿合作安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署一項新協議，旨在實現服務貿易的基本自由化。 該協議將二零一四年在廣東省試點推行的自由化措施擴展至全國範圍。 協議原則上賦予香港銀行國民待遇，預期將為這些銀行在內地從事業務提供更大的政策確定性及靈活性。\n\n# 培訓\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行（PBoC）、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行保險監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。課程內容涵蓋中央銀行業務和一般風險管理，另包括消費者保護、信用記錄、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健性指標分析以及系統性風險監測等。此外，亦為來自海外銀行和執法機構的代表團舉辦特別培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n香港金融管理局年內舉行八次機構投資者政府債券招標，總值204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構政府債券餘額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n二零一五年全球金融市場動盪不安，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此艱難的投資環境下，結匯基金於二零一五年錄得整體投資回報率為負零點六巴仙，但其虧損相較於主要市場指數及同類投資基金而言，相對輕微。這主要歸功於香港金融管理局過去數年實施的一系列防禦措施，有效提升了結匯基金的韌性。\n\n# 外匯穩定基金\n\n根據《交換基金條例》的規定，交換基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全，以協助鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位。交換基金由財政司司長控制，經諮詢交換基金諮詢委員會後，可投資於其認為合適的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交易所基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合的結構\n\n香港金融管理局已為外匯基金設定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 維護資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均由高流動性美元計價資產充分支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠流動性以維持貨幣與金融穩定；\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以維護基金長期購買力。\n\n這些目標全面考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並融入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金設有兩個主要投資組合，分別為擔保組合和投資組合。擔保組合持有高度流動的美元計價資產，以符合貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分擔保。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場，以保值並維持資產的長期購買力。兩大組合的整體長期債券與股票配置目標比例為72:28。在目標貨幣配置方面，81%的資產配置於美元和港元，其餘19%配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更有效管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已以審慎及漸進方式，將部分外匯基金的投資組合多元化，投資範圍包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股票投資於投資組合內，而私募股權及房地產投資則投資於長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。香港金融管理局維持LTGP投資的淨資產價值上限為外匯基金累積結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP的投資市值總額為1421億港元，其中私募股權投資為913億港元，房地產投資為508億港元，未償投資承諾金額為1224億港元。\n\n戰略投資組合於二零零七年成立，用以持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份。此組合乃政府代表外匯基金以策略性目的購入股份後所持有，因其性質特殊，故未納入基金投資表現評估範圍內。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資流程，建立在兩種資產配置決策之上：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置體現於投資基準，反映了外匯基金在投資目標下的長期最佳資產組合。在策略性配置的指導下，會根據市場情況對資產進行戰術性調整，以期超越基準的回報。這通常意味著實際資產配置與基準或策略性配置存在差異。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。投資基準及戰術偏離的幅度，由財政司司長諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後決定，而具體的戰術決策則由香港金融管理局在授權範圍內執行。在容許的戰術偏離幅度內，投資組合經理可採取投資策略，以把握短期市場的機會。\n\n# 投資管理業務\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，其中包括整個核心投資組合及部分投資組合。此部分投資組合涵蓋投資於全球固定收益市場的多個投資組合，以及用於實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的各類衍生工具對沖組合。\n\n# 外部管理之運用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦委任設立於多個國際金融中心的外部基金管理機構，管理約佔外匯基金資產的24%，其中包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產。委任外部管理機構的目的是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以獲取多元化的投資風格，並將市場知識和資訊轉移至內部專業人員。\n\n與外部經理人相關的支出包含基金管理費、托管費用、交易成本以及預扣稅款和其他稅項。此等支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及合規性\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。香港金融管理局已為內部及外部管理的投資組合建立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切留意其遵守情況。風險控制工具被應用於評估在正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險。金管局亦會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內外部管理者的投資技能。\n\n# 外匯基金績效\n\n# 2015年的金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動較大，其中股市表現尤為反覆。年初時，主要股市均創下新高。然而，受中國大陸經濟增長疑慮影響，市場情緒在第三季度急轉直下，導致主要股市先前漲幅盡數回落，並錄得顯著的季度虧損。隨後，隨著市場情緒的逐步改善，全球股市一度有所回升，但年底再次承壓下跌。由於與中國大陸經濟聯繫緊密，香港股市在2015年的表現相較於其他主要股市遜色。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國將啟動利率正常化並進入升息週期，但2015年美國長期國債收益率僅溫和上漲，原因是全球經濟增長擔憂、持續的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張局勢的影響。另一方面，在歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策下，歐洲短期政府債券收益率下跌，部分甚至跌入負利率。\n\n在2015年，美元於外匯市場持續走強，美元指數上漲近10%，主要受到市場預期美國將啟動升息的影響。歐元在第一季大幅走弱，跌幅為自1999年以來單季最大，源於歐洲中央銀行於一月宣布實施量化寬鬆政策。與此同時，日圓對美元匯率在2015年大致維持穩定。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表一所示。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n在極度動盪的金融市場及艱難的投資環境下，外匯基金於2015年錄得投資虧損158億港元。虧損主要來自：海外股票收益71億港元、香港股票虧損50億港元、債券收益159億港元，以及非港元資產因美元大幅升值而產生的負面匯率換算影響449億港元，另有基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益111億港元。去年美元走強，將外匯基金的非美元資產換算為港元，導致此項負面匯率影響在所難免。與此同時，策略性投資組合錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n截至2015年底，外匯基金總資產達3,4229億港元。2015年，外匯基金的投資回報率（不包括策略投資組合）為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及整體投資基金業界相比，外匯基金的虧損可謂相對較小。為預期投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局過去數年已採取一系列防禦措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化的步伐，特別是透過長期投資策略組合（LTGP，即長期投資政府基金）進行的投資。這些措施增強了外匯基金的韌性，並有助減輕潛在損失。\n\n基金於1994年至2015年的年度報酬率載於圖表1。表2顯示2015年的投資報酬率，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資報酬率。過去三年平均報酬率為1.2%，過去五年為1.8%，過去十年為3.3%，自1994年以來為5.0%。表3顯示基金於2015年12月31日的資產貨幣配置。\n\n圖表1 交易所基金投資回報（1994 – 2015）\n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略組合的持倉。\n2. 綜合消費者物價指數根據以2009\/2010年為基期的系列計算。\n"}

Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 公司部門職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及多種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策及運作的了解。二零一五年，香港金融管理局致力改善公司治理，具體措施包括支持員工專業發展、嚴格執行財務紀律、加強資訊科技安全，以及重新調整高層管理職責，藉此應對新計劃及系統實施以及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 與社區合作 企業發展\n\n# 新聞關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度並促進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。二零一五年，共舉辦五十九項公開媒體活動，包括十四場新聞發佈會、十四場現場採訪及三十一項其他公開活動。此外，另安排了四十三場媒體專訪，發佈三百二十五份中英雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為提升公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，特意安排兩次媒體參觀，分別前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司，以展示香港先進的鈔票印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時，亦舉辦了關於貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的研討會，為媒體提供更深入的資訊，以便更全面了解這些重要議題。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖（中）及執行董事（貨幣管理）李惠來（右）於香港印鈔有限公司的媒體參觀時，檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n香港銀行同業結算有限公司舉行傳媒參觀時的自動化支票分類演示。照片中央（由左至右）為香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德南先生、金融基礎設施執行董事李奕明先生，以及香港銀行同業結算有限公司行政總裁唐麗嫦女士。\n\n# 公司部門職能\n\n# 公眾詢問\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供有效途徑，從香港金融管理局獲取資訊，以加深對該機構主要職能的了解。該服務於2015年處理了9,078宗查詢，其中約一半涉及銀行政策及法規、紙幣硬幣以及消費者銀行業務。值得注意的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收集計劃。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年起收到的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則提供2015年查詢性質的分類資料。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除香港金融管理局年報外，過去一年香港金融管理局還發布了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》、四期《季刊》，並定期更新《每月統計通訊》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新及主題資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員發表了十四篇《洞察》文章，內容涵蓋各項切時的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局二零一四年年報在香港管理專業協會二零一五年最佳年報獎的「非牟利及慈善機構」類別中獲得銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過五萬頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的主要入口。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條所維護的「授權機構證券人員登記冊」及「授權機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站亦會載有根據該條例設立的「儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊」。網站設有專頁及醒目快捷連結，以引起公眾對重要及時資訊的關注，例如提醒市民提高警惕，防範電話詐騙，以及提供硬幣收集計劃中硬幣收集車的位置資訊。\n\n# 公司部門職能\n\n# 公共教育方案\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向公眾介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並提升市民對貨幣及銀行事務的認識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每周開放六日。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展歷程，並提供閱讀資料和展品，供公眾研究香港的貨幣、銀行和金融事務。\n\n資訊中心為訪客提供導覽服務。本年度，該中心接待訪客逾四萬八千三百人次，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過六百三十場導覽活動（見圖表三）。自二零零三年十二月開幕以來，已有超過五十三萬零四百人次造訪該中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，用於深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，圖書館亦維護香港授權機構的電子登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推行聯繫社區計劃，並繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。二零一五年，共舉辦三場講座，約有二千三百名中學生及教師參與。講座內容涵蓋聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡明智使用以及存款保障計劃。自一九九八年推出以來，已超過五萬四千七百人參與此計劃。\n\n圖3 資訊中心各類團體參觀\n\n年輕的遊客在導覽員帶領下參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣和銀行業的發展歷程。\n\n中學師生參與公眾教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招募、培訓一支高度專業的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的工作重點。儘管香港金融管理局是政府的一部分，但其可採用與公務員制度不同的聘用條件，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力維持精簡靈活的組織結構，並重新調配員工資源以開展新措施及應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織調整\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年12月根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》成立零售支付監理處，隸屬於貨幣管理部，以履行香港金融管理局在持牌及日常監管儲值設施和其他零售支付系統方面的法定職責。為提升部門協調，並重新分配資源以應對新措施帶來的挑戰及日益增加的工作複雜性，香港金融管理局於2015年計劃在2016年初對部分部門的職務作調整。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎建設部（FID）接管了執行部門（ENFD）及貨幣處（MMD）原有的存款保障計劃管理及結算職能。此外，該部亦接手銀行部門部分與銀行業相關的業務，包括消費者教育、董事培訓，以及銀行從業員專業發展規劃。\n\n外部部門接掌了MMD的市場開發職能，而MMD將繼續處理與國庫市場協會及金融基準相關的工作；且\n\nENFD 承接了銀行監理部門的反洗錢及金融犯罪風險部，並更名為執法及反洗錢部。\n\n# 公司部門職能\n\n# 人力配置\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年編制為841人。為確保提供足夠資源應對以下事項，2016年增加34人至875人（增幅為4%）：(i) 新法例及措施的落實；(ii) 維持持續進行且已被證明必要的試點計劃；以及(iii) 現有工作的日益複雜和工作量不斷增加。新增職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n強化銀行及金融體系的穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場審查、落實國際銀行標準及同業評審活動；\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險和網絡安全風險管理的監管；\n\n落實依據新生效之店頭衍生工具申報及紀錄保存規定，針對透過銀行及核准經紀商辦理之店頭衍生工具所建立的監理框架。\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監管與執法力度。\n\n為落實《金融機構復甦及解決機制條例》，目前正加緊規劃準備工作，此條例採用國際標準以應對金融業「大到不能倒」的問題。\n\n透過發展銀行獨立非執行董事的董事賦權計畫，提升銀行治理水平，並與業界合作，共同推動銀行核心業務領域從業人員的專業能力框架建置，藉此促進銀行業整體能力建設。\n\n加強銀行業行為準則政策及新興銀行、證券和保險產品的研究能力。\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；並\n\n加強對境內人民幣市場及CNH市場發展情況的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對未來基金設立及交易所基金投資組合多元化的投資、風險管理和法律協助，並提升戰略性資產配置及投資流程，以應對日趨嚴峻的投資環境。\n\n實施新的法定制度，賦權香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監管儲值設施及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 公司部門職能\n\n香港金融管理局會視乎其他工作需要，調動人力資源。局方會將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，協助該等機構處理與香港或香港金融管理局息息相關的活動或政策倡議。部分員工會以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障局及財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪資調整機制\n\n財政司長（FS）根據治理小組（GSC）的建議，透過匯率基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並參考現行市場水平與慣例。薪酬包括總現金薪酬及公積金計劃，實物福利極少。總現金薪酬由每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）與變動薪金組成，變動薪金視員工表現而定，每年以一次性方式發放。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工薪酬由財政司長（FS）每年審閱，其依據為政府總部（GSC）透過行政金融事務委員會（EFAC）向其提出的建議。審閱時會同時考慮GSC對香港金融管理局上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問機構對金融業界薪酬的調查結果，以及其他相關因素。為維持優秀員工的薪酬競爭力，財政司長或會不定期對表現卓越的個別員工作出特別調整。\n\n任何經批准的香港金融管理局固定薪酬年度調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據個別員工的表現分配。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員適用變動薪酬制度，旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。對於職級為執行董事或以上的員工，其薪酬調整或獎勵由財務服務（FS）在治理與策略委員會（GSC）的建議下批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬時不會在場。職級為部門主管或以下的員工薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金融管理局總裁根據財務服務的授權，在已批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 外匯穩定基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 審計署\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n我謹此證明，我已審核了第134至222頁所列載的外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）財務報表，包括截至2015年12月31日的本集團及外匯基金的資產負債表，以及截至同日止年度的收入支出表、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包含重大會計政策摘要及其他解釋性資料。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據行政長官根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）第7條發出的指示，以及香港財務報告準則，編製真實公允的財務報表，並實施其認為必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因詐欺或錯誤而導致的重大錯報。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計工作，對這些財務報表發表意見。我依照《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，以及審計署的審計準則執行審計。 這些準則要求我遵守道德規範，並規劃及執行審計程序，以獲取合理保證，確認財務報表不存在重大錯報。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以取得關於財務報表金額及揭露事項的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計人的專業判斷，包括評估財務報表重大錯報風險，不論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致。審計人於進行風險評估時，會考量與該實體編製真實公允財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適宜於具體情況的審計程序，但並非為評估該實體內部控制的有效性。審計亦包括評估貨幣當局所採用會計政策的適當性及所作會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體列報。\n\n我認為取得的審計證據足夠且恰當，足以作為審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計長報告（續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實且公允地反映了截至二零一五年十二月三十一日，交換基金及其集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現與現金流量，並已依照香港財務報告準則妥善編製，且符合根據《交換基金條例》第七條行政長官發出的指示。\n\n孫大衛 審計總監\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計署\n香港灣仔\n告士威路7號\n入境事務大樓26樓\n\n# 目錄\n\n收入與支出表\n全面收益表\n資產負債表\n股東權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註\n\n1.  主要業務活動\n2.  重要會計政策\n3.  會計政策變更\n4.  收入與支出\n5.  所得稅\n6.  金融資產與金融負債類別\n7.  現金及約當現金\n8.  存放於銀行及其他金融機構資金\n9.  指定以公允價值衡量之金融資產\n10. 可供出售證券\n11. 衍生金融工具\n12. 持有至到期日證券\n13. 貸款組合\n14. 黃金\n15. 其他資產\n16. 子公司權益\n17. 聯營公司及合資企業權益\n18. 投資物業\n19. 物業、廠房及設備\n20. 債務憑證、政府發行流通貨幣紙幣及硬幣\n21. 銀行體系餘額\n22. 銀行及其他金融機構存款\n23. 財政儲備存款\n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存款\n25. 發行之結匯基金票據及紙幣\n26. 銀行貸款\n27. 其他已發行債務證券\n28. 其他負債\n29. 股東權益\n30. 現金流量表內現金及現金等價物分析\n31. 營運部門資訊\n32. 質押資產\n33. 承諾事項\n34. 或有負債\n35. 重大關聯方交易\n36. 金融風險管理\n37. 金融工具公允價值衡量\n38. 財務報表日後非調整事項\n39. 截至2015年12月31日止年度已發布但尚未生效之修訂、新準則及詮釋可能產生之影響\n40. 財務報表核准\n\n# 外匯基金 – 收支帳戶\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為本財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 外匯儲備基金 – 綜合收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為本財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 交換基金 – 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n陳德霖\n香港金融管理局\n二零一六年四月七日\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註是這些財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 所有者權益變動表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為本財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 交換基金 – 現金流量表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n# 外匯基金 – 現金流量表（續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為本財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港元計。）\n\n# 1 主要營業項目\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長 selaku 外匯基金（「基金」）監管人的授權，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是維護港幣的匯兌價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全。\n\n基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：即支持性投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及策略投資組合。支持性投資組合的資產完全對應香港的貨幣基礎，由香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據聯繫匯率制度維持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司股份，由香港特別行政區政府代表基金購入，以作策略用途。經營分部資料載於附註31。\n\n# 2. 重大會計政策\n\n## 2.1 符合規定聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，此準則涵蓋所有個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發佈的解釋，並符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）所採納的重大會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發布若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，於本會計期間首次生效或可供早期採用。附註3載列因首次採納這些準則而導致的會計政策調整（如有），以及這些調整對本集團本期及過期財務報表所反映會計期間的影響。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港元計。）\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括本集團之財務報表以及其於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務詳見附註16及17。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按公允價值列示，詳情請參閱下述會計政策。\n\n交易金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n以公允價值計量的金融資產與金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n黃金（附註 2.11）；及\n投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需要運用判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響會計政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入及費用的報告金額。 這些估計及相關假設乃基於經驗及管理層在當時情況下認為合理的其他因素，其結果構成評估資產及負債賬面價值的依據，而這些賬面價值並非容易從其他來源直接得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所差異。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續審查。會計估計的修訂若僅影響當期，則於當期認列；若同時影響當期及未來期間，則於修訂當期及未來期間認列。\n\n附註18包含投資性不動產公允價值評估的相關假設資訊。附註37包含金融工具公允價值評估的相關假設資訊。除附註2.5所載特定金融工具的估值外，本集團應用會計政策未涉及關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及少數權益\n\n子公司是由本集團控制的實體。本集團控制一項實體，係指本集團因參與該實體而有權獲得變動回報，並有能力透過對該實體的控制權影響該等回報。評估本集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由本集團及其他各方持有）。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港元計。）\n\n對子公司的投資自取得控制權之日起至喪失控制權之日止，併入本集團財務報表。\n\n於編製集團財務報表時，集團內各公司間的帳戶餘額、交易及現金流動，以及因集團內交易而產生之未實現損益，均全部抵銷。\n\n非控制權益指子公司中未直接或間接歸屬於基金的權益，且本集團與該等權益持有人之間並未另訂任何條款，致使本集團整體就該等權益產生符合財務負債定義的合約義務。非控制權益於本集團資產負債表內權益部分單獨列示，與歸屬於基金的權益分開呈現。本集團的非控制權益於本集團損益表及綜合收益表中，以分配當年度盈餘或虧損以及綜合收益或損失予非控制權益與基金之間的方式列示。\n\n基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去減值損失（如有）（附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 關聯公司及合資企業\n\n本集團對聯營公司具有重大影響力，但並未擁有其控制權或共同控制權，此影響力源於本集團參與該聯營公司財務及營運政策決策的能力。\n"}
