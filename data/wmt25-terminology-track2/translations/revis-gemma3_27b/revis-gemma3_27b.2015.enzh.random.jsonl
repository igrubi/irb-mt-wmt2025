{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年錄得較慢的增長，反映內需轉弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年的經濟增長將保持緩和，在嚴峻的外部逆風和脆弱的金融市場情況下。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港的經濟增長在今年放緩，本地生產總值 (GDP) 增長從 2014 年的 2.6% 減慢至 2.4%（表 1）。這反映了內需擴大減緩，儘管淨出口恢復為對本地生產總值增長的貢獻者，因為總進口下跌速度快於總出口（圖 1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞動力市場大致穩定，失業率維持在約 3.3% 的低水平。由於國內成本和進口價格的壓力減弱，通脹進一步緩和。本地股市在環球金融市場加劇的波動下大幅上落。在 2 月公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始回軟，房價顯示出年底進一步盤整的跡象。\n\n圖 1 實際本地生產總值按貢獻計算的增長\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n表 1 實際本地生產總值按支出構成增長（期對期）\n\n注意：經季節因素調整的季對季國內固定資本形成變動率不可得。\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣前線，2015年維持了港元匯率穩定，港元兌美國的匯率維持在7.75附近。由於股權相關的流入，強方可換性承諾於4月被觸發，並於9月及10月再次被觸發，反映離岸人民幣拆倉轉為港元及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總體結餘擴大，本地利率繼續維持低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率則在12月中美國加息後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降。銀行業整體貸款質素輕微削弱，但分類貸款水平仍然維持在低水平。\n\n# 國內需求\n\n2015年國內需求增長步伐轉慢。雖然就業與收入情況大致穩定，繼續提供支持，但較弱的消費者信心以及資產價格的調整，拖累私人消費在第二上半年增長。然而，由於首輪相對強勁的增長動能，私人消費全年增長從2014年的3.3%增加至4.8%。政府消費則輕微加快，增長3.4%。事實上，國內需求增長步伐轉慢主要由於固定資本形成總額下跌2.2%（圖2）。私人部門機械與設備採購連續第二年收縮，企業信心轉弱，同時建築與建設活動也顯示出轉弱的增長動力，與公共工程進度放緩同步。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年轉差（圖3）。商品出口錄得廣泛下跌1.7%，為自2009年以來首輪。出口至日本及歐洲聯盟下跌，而出口至美國則僅錄得微弱增長。這些先進市場的呆滯最終需求亦拖累地區工業活動及區域內貿易。結果，香港出口至中國內地、新加坡、南韓及台灣亦因這些經濟體轉弱的中間及最終需求而下跌。香港的服務出口繼續從早年高增長路徑輕微放緩，並在2015年達到0.6%的下跌，主要由於入境旅遊放緩。商品進口亦因較弱的內需及出口引致需求而下跌。相對而言，服務進口因本地居民強勁的旅遊興趣而加快增長。以淨額計算，整體貿易順差在2015年輕微優化，對本地生產總值增長作出溫和正數貢獻。\n\n圖表 2 國內需求 資料來源：人口普查統計署\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n由於本地成本壓力放緩及進口物價通脹減退，2015年潛在通脹進一步下降。扣除政府的一項紓緩措施效應後，潛在通脹率從2014年的3.5%下降至2.5%（圖4）。在經濟活動欠佳的情況下，勞工成本壓力仍然穩定，而商業及工業租金成本壓力則有所減退，尤其是在第二季度。由於全球商品價格回軟及港元強勁，進口物價壓力減退，食品通脹亦平穩維持低水平。早前季度新訂房屋租金的影響輕微，因此通脹中的租金成分受到遏抑。\n\n圖3

勞動市場\n\n勞動市場情況在2015年仍然穩定。勞動需求持有，貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業下跌大致被其他商業部門穩定的招聘步伐抵銷，因此總就業人數較早前一年上升1.3%。勞動供應亦上升1.3%，經季節因素調整的失業率全年的平穩維持在約3.3%（圖5）。鑑於仍然偏緊的勞動市場，名義工資在首輪三個季度上升4.7%，對比2014年的4.3%。隨著通脹壓力減輕，首輪三個季度實際勞動工資增加1.3%，對比2014年的下跌0.1%。\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市因外部環境的重大變化而經歷一年的波動。首季表現平淡，然而在內地A股市場的牛市情緒及資金流入下，第二季本地股市顯著回升。恒生指數於4月激增至七年高位，這是自2014年11月起，滬港通南向每日額度首次被耗盡（圖6）。然而，自6月起，本地市場出現逆轉，恒生指數下跌28%，於9月跌至一年低位，受到內地A股市場及全球股市的拋售、全球外匯市場的波動加劇以及國際商品價格疲軟的影響。在環球及內地金融市場回穩下，本港股市在最後一季有所回升。整體而言，2015年恒生指數錄得7.2%的下跌，為自2011年以來最差的表現，而平均每日成交額從2014年的69.5億港元上升至1,115.6億港元。儘管集資活動在第二季後半段放緩，但從本地股市籌集到的整體股本資金增加至1,115.6億港元，較早前的942.7億港元增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整固的跡象。在2015年初經歷了一段活躍的期間，繼2月公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始回軟。雖然在去年第四季之前樓價上升步伐放緩，並在最後一個季下跌，但2015年樓價累計上升2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%上升幅度（圖6）。與此同時，交易量較去年同期下跌12.3%，至55,982宗，原因是二手市場的交易活動在下半年明顯減少。投機性交易，包括確認交易及短期炒賣交易，持續維持低水平。儘管如此，家庭購房負擔仍然沉重，樓價與收入比率達到15.7，而收入負擔比率則遠高於其長期平均水平。商業及工業物業市場在上半年表現活躍，但其後交易活動放緩，價格及租金在最後一個季錄得下跌。租金回報率大致與去年同期相同，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖

經濟環境\n\n香港的經濟增長在2016年預期將保持緩和。私人機構分析師項目經濟將以較慢的平均增長率1.7%擴大，而政府預測增長範圍在1–2%之間。具體而言，欠佳的全球經濟展望、持續的入境旅遊轉弱，以及來自動盪的全球金融市場情況的負面溢出效應將繼續抑制香港出口的表現。本地而言，預期私人消費將適度增長，因為勞動力市場情況可能面臨一些壓力下轉弱的經濟動能，以及本地資產價格調整可損及消費者信心並引起負面財富效應。建築和施工活動可持有，但疲弱的商業信心和利率上升將影響私人資本投資。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n通脹壓力預期在2016年將保持受到遏抑。進口價格壓力料將維持緩和，而國內成本壓力則預期在經濟增長動能輕微的情況下維持溫和。由於2015年底新訂房屋租賃壓力減弱，通脹中的租金成分亦可能減弱。市場共識預期2016年的整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府預計核心通脹率為2.0%。受入境旅遊放緩及出口部門持續疲軟影響，勞動市場也可能稍為回軟。目前私人機構分析師預期2016年的失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n2016年的經濟展望會面對數目不明朗因素和風險。特別是美國利率進一步上升的步伐、全球增長展望以及大宗商品價格走勢，將繼續成為主要的不確定資料來源。任何顯著不利發展都可加劇全球金融市場和國際資本流動的波動，從而緊縮本地貨幣和金融情況，並對香港的增長展望投下陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的因此效應，很大程度取決於它們對房地產市場的影響，透過財富效應和資產負債表效應。雖然房地產市場正面臨來自全球和本地金融市場轉弱、美國利率正常化，以及房屋供需差距收窄所帶來的日益下行風險，但仍需更多時間來設立房地產市場是否已進入下行周期。儘管房地產市場的突然調整可能構成對整體經濟的重大逆風，但過去幾年引入的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施已顯著增強了香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業績\n\n香港銀行業在該年仍然穩健，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策出現進一步分歧，以及新興市場經濟體的風險與不穩定因素積累。認可機構的流動性情況繼續良好，本地註冊的認可機構資本充裕。零售銀行的資產質素輕微轉差，但維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n與美國美元利率接軌，港元銀行間利率全年在低水平。零售銀行的港元資金成本首輪上半年隨綜合利率下行趨勢下跌，第二半年仍然穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖7

BlR 指香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報的最優惠貸款利率（每月平均）。\n\n\n# 盈利能力走勢\n\n銀行業的盈利能力於2015年放緩。零售銀行香港辦事處的總體稅前營業利潤下跌28%，因費用及佣金收入（上升9.7%）、外匯及衍生工具業務收入（上升22.4%）及淨利息收入（上升1.3%）被營運費用增加8.8%及貸款減值費用增加76%所抵銷。然而，零售銀行的稅後利潤增加14.7%，主要由於出售策略性投資所產生的收益。零售銀行的稅後資產回報率由2014年的0.99%優化至1.05%（圖8）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

貨幣穩定性\n\n港幣匯率在2015年全年大致穩定，儘管金融市場動盪，且美國於12月啟動升息。資金市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。作為過去數十年香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯匯制度仍然對外來衝擊穩健。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目的是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣於外匯市場對美國美元的匯率，於本港幣7.75至7.85兌美國美元1的區間內保持穩定。貨幣制度的結構以貨幣發行局安排為特徵，規定貨幣基礎至少需由持有於發行基金內的美國美元儲備支持百分之一百，且貨幣基礎的變動需與美國美元儲備的相應變動配合百分之一百。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括\n\n負債證明書，為3家發行銀行發行的票據提供十足的支持。\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣的流通金額。\n總體餘額，即銀行在香港金融管理局持有的結算賬戶餘額總額。\n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的票據。\n\n香港貨幣兌換率的穩定，是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局堅決履行兌換保證（CUs）的承諾而維持。當對港元的需求較大於供應，且市場兌換率轉強至每美元7.75港元的強方兌換保證時，香港金融管理局準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總體結餘將隨之擴大，推低港元利率，創造貨幣情況，使港元由強方上限回復至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供應較大於需求，且市場兌換率轉弱至每美元7.85港元的弱方兌換保證時，香港金融管理局會從銀行買入港元。總體結餘將隨之收縮，推高港元利率，使港元由弱方上限維持於兌換範圍內。\n\n負債證明書及政府發行的貨幣紙幣和硬幣的流通金額，均以港元面值計算。本年度報告中，交換基金的資產負債表所載的相應項目，以港元表示，等值於根據資產負債表日期的現行匯率換算所需的美元數額。此安排根據香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\n根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表交易所基金持有與其在二手市場交易 EFBN 有關的 EFBN，會抵銷發行的 EFBN，並於資產負債表中錄得淨金額。本年度報告中載於的 EFBN 金額與交易所基金資產負債表中的金額不同。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n香港貨幣兌美元匯率在2015年大致保持穩定，於7.7500至7.7657之間窄幅波動（圖1）。2015年初，市場對美國利率升息的憂慮使港元匯率出現輕微轉弱壓力。然而，第二季港元匯率轉強至貼近7.75，主要由於4月股市活動熱絡，帶動與股票相關的港元需求急升，導致強方兌換保證（CU）多次被觸發。踏入下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著沽售，以及全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動增加，港元兌美元匯率仍持續貼近7.75。受離岸人民幣拆倉推動，強方兌換保證在9月及10月再次被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調25個基點，但港元兌美元匯率全年仍維持於窄幅區間內波動，沒有顯著流出壓力。整體而言，2015年香港貨幣兌美元匯市運作有序，儘管全球金融市場情況動盪。\n\n圖一 二零一五年市場匯率\n\n由於強方兌換保證在4月、9月及10月多次被觸發，根據貨幣發行局原則，香港金融管理局被動地購入總計293億美元，換取2,272億港元。這導致總體結餘相應擴大，部分擴大被增發的外匯基金票據抵銷，以回應銀行對流動性管理的強烈需求（圖2）。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這顯示貨幣基礎的組成部分發生變化，而貨幣基礎則全面由外匯儲備支持。總體結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及紙幣總額，由早前的9,925億港元增加至2015年底的12,210億港元。\n\n圖2 總體餘額及2015年未償還外匯基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在銀行體系流動性充裕的情況下，港元銀行間利率於2015年全年仍然低位。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於美國時間12月16日由0–0.25%上調至0.25至0.5%後，根據既定公式，基準利率亦於12月17日上調至0.75%。整體而言，2015年銀行間利率從隔夜至三個月期均平穩於基準利率之下（圖3），輕微波動主要受銀行季節性流動性需要及8月金融市場情況波動導致的流動性收緊所影響。大致追蹤香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）的差距，港元遠期點數於8月市場流動性收緊期間轉為顯著溢價，其後因美元利率增加，年底時段則回落至折讓（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常運作，貼現窗借款並未活躍，2015年僅為28億本港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖3 2015年香港銀行同業拆息利率\n\n圖4 2015年港元遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯匯制度繼續暢順運作，並顯著推動了香港過去數十年的貨幣和金融穩定。鑑於香港經濟小而啟用，以及其作為國際金融中心的角色，聯匯制度維持對香港來說是最合適的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅決有決心維持聯匯制度。事實上，外匯和貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的公信力，公眾繼續對港幣作為支付方式和保值抱有信心。在2015年與香港的第四次諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織繼續支持聯匯制度為香港最優惠的貨幣安排，並引用香港健全的體制、法律和政策框架、充裕的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及良好的金融系統作為推動聯匯制度暢順運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於強健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測驗結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管，以優化銀行業的韌性。鑑於美國利率上升，香港金融管理局提醒公眾做好必要準備以管理風險，指出任何觸發弱方兌換保證及港元流出，均是港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月以來，已將特定部分的發鈔基金資產指定用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產分為貨幣基礎）於2015年於106.3至107.5%的窄範圍內上落，沒有觸及上或下觸發水平。比率於12月31日為106.3%（圖5）。根據聯匯制度，雖然已指定特定發鈔基金資產用於支持組合，但所有發鈔基金資產均可得於支持港元匯率。基金的大量金融資源提供強力後盾，以保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定，以防突然衝擊。\n\n圖5 2015年支持比率的每日變動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的貨幣板子委員會監察有關香港貨幣及金融穩定的議題。於2015年，該委員會考慮的議題包括全球銀行提供的國際美國美元貸款供應、國際使用宏觀審慎措施、美國加息對香港樓市的影響、基本利率的慗定公式、港元實質有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的國家風險。該委員會討論的記錄及提交予委員會的貨幣板運作報告均載於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行和金融領域的研究。2015年，學會舉辦了16位研究員，並載於27篇工作論文。\n\n學會舉辦了5場國際會議和研討會。主要的包括：\n\n一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟會議，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率及穩定性：中國與國際經驗」。會議呈交了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋廣泛的議題，例如中國企業槓桿、中國信貸泡沫與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供應。\n可舉行的香港金融研究中心與香港大學聯合會議，名為「香港金融研究中心－香港大學國際金融、制度與經濟增長會議」。會議涵蓋了多種不同的經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n十月舉行的香港金融研究中心、美國聯邦儲備系統行長、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行聯合會議，主題為「分歧的貨幣政策、全球資本流動與金融穩定」。會議探討了廣泛的議題，包括貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率的關係、分歧的貨幣政策及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該學會亦於8月舉辦第13屆香港金融研究中心暑期研討班，並於9月舉辦第13屆香港金融研究中心中國大陸經濟會議，探討中國大陸財政改革和地方政府融資問題。這些會議和研討班吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業和全球中央銀行的參加者。此外，該學會在年內舉辦了24場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣和金融議題。\n\n# 紙鈔與硬幣\n\n於2015年底，流通金額為本港幣360.2億元，較一年前上升5.3%（圖6、圖7及圖8）。政府發行紙幣及硬幣的總流通金額為112億元，上升2.9%（圖9及圖10）。政府發行本港幣10元紙幣的流通價值為4.0億元，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在獲授權機構的風險管治上，包括信貸和流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢和打擊恐怖融資控制，以及投資和保險產品的銷售實踐。隨著系統性風險的累積，香港金融管理局宣布香港的區域性逆周期資本緩衝為0.625%（自2016年1月1日起生效，並於2017年1月1日起提高至1.25%）。有5家獲授權機構被指定為國內系統性重要銀行，這些銀行會面對較高的損失吸收力資本緩衝。在恢復和決議的改革方面，隨著《金融機構（解決）條例草案》提交立法會，已包括了顯著的進度。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業的工作，以加強基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事和金融從業員的技能和知識發展。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策路向出現分歧的跡象下，新興市場在2015年面臨較高的資本外流風險和較慢的經濟增長。為維持銀行業對宏觀經濟環境可能突然惡化的韌性，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察認可機構（AIs）風險治理的成效及其信貸和流動性風險管理系統。\n\n# 運作監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採納監管方法，即定期現場檢查輔以增加數目的主題審查。主題審查是對部分認可機構的特定風險範疇或活動進行的深度非現場審查。這種方法容許香港金融管理局優先配置其監管資源，重點關注認可機構所面對的潛在及更重大風險。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局共進行了193次現場檢查。鑑於認可機構貸款組合的資產質素出現惡化的跡象，因此進行了更深入的主題性現場檢查，重點關注信貸風險管理及資產質素。鑑於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策的分歧，以及隨之而來的市場不確定性，香港金融管理局亦增加了對與財務相關活動的檢查數目。此外，亦對與內地相關業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制，以及認可機構的內部評分基礎（IRB）模型進行了現場檢查。在本年度內，專門小組亦對認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，總共進行了152項主題性的非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查相似的範疇。表1包含運作監督工作的詳情。\n\n2015 年進行了 196 次現場外審查，以評估認可機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管重點關注風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸以及巴塞爾三標準的推行。監管小組維持與部分認可機構董事會及外部會計師的頻繁聯繫。與認可機構高階管理層及外部會計師舉行了 20 次三方會議，同時與部分認可機構的董事會或董事會水平委員會舉行了 23 次會議。\n\n銀行監理審查委員會考慮了4個個案，所有個案均涉及認可機構的授權。\n\n為更好運用其監管資源以應對競爭優先事項，香港金融管理局繼續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求認可機構委任外部審計師跟進潛在監管問題。香港金融管理局於2015年根據此條款委託了6份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢或打擊恐怖主義融資控制，另外兩份報告涵蓋私人銀行業務，餘下則與包括證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等範疇有關。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n沒有任何認可機構違反了《銀行條例》於2015年有關資本充足率或流動性比率的要求。雖然在《銀行條例》的各種條文中出現了84宗違規行為，但均未受影響存款人的利益，並且已由認可機構迅速處理。\n\n表1 運作監督\n\n# 《銀行條例》第52條的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc 繼續會面對《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權限。2008年6月25日，貨幣當局根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對Melli Bank Plc香港分行的事務、業務及財產所作出的指示，在當年仍然有效。香港金融管理局將繼續與有關權限保持定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總行相關的發展情況，並會留意已採取的監督措施，以保護認可機構存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評級審查\n\nCAMEL 認可委員會檢討並制定了認可機構的綜合 CAMEL 等級。認可機構已獲通知評級結果，並有機會請求審查。該年並無任何審查請求。\n\n# 特定監督工作\n\n# 營運及科技風險的監控\n\n鑑於新興風險及行業發展，香港金融管理局繼續發行有關營運及科技風險管理的新指引。特別是，香港金融管理局已完成《監察政策手冊》(SPM) 模組的修訂，容許認可機構在產品種類方面有更大的彈性。此外，香港金融管理局亦簽發了一份有關網絡安全的通函，重申認可機構的董事會及高級管理層對有效網絡安全風險管理進行監察的重要性。香港金融管理局亦定期載於其《營運事故監察》報告中，重點介紹部分詐騙個案或營運事故的作案手法及識別出的監控漏洞。\n\n香港金融管理局進行了基於風險的專題實地及非實地監理審查，以評估部分認可機構在企業水平或特定業務範疇的營運及科技風險管理。這些審查涵蓋認可機構營運風險管理框架、網絡安全風險管理、防範違規交易活動的控制、重要外判服務供應商的監管、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢的科技控制等部分範疇。這些監理審查亦輔以年度獨立合規演練，涵蓋營運風險管理框架、科技風險管理（包括客戶數據保護）及業務持續規劃，部分認可機構須要委任獨立及合資格的評估員，以檢視其有關控制的充分性，然後糾正所識別的弱點。香港金融管理局亦識別並分析了認可機構營運及科技風險的趨勢和重點，特別關注在香港貨幣及銀行系統穩定和有效運作中扮演重要角色的認可機構。\n\n香港金融管理局監察銀行業推行基於晶片的自動櫃員機技術的最後階段，認可機構於2015年底完成純信用卡的換卡程序。香港金融管理局亦須要發行信用卡的認可機構落實認證控制措施，以進一步改善郵寄或電話信用卡交易的安全性。另一方面，在收取報告指部分非接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可被秘密存取後，香港金融管理局要求有關認可機構迅速採取行動，通知及保護受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局投入資源闡釋事件的規模及影響，以解決公眾關注，並監察認可機構的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他持份者協作，推行多項措施，包括舉辦提高公眾對電子銀行保安預防措施的意識計劃、設立分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為香港金融服務業務連續性管理論壇舉辦的危機管理演習提供支援和意見，該演習涉及認可機構及其他金融公司。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構密切合作，為認可機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引及監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構理事會的框架下，維持與監管機構的定期聯繫。這些會議涵蓋了涉及金融集團或受監管實體在金融服務業不同領域中業務關係密切的各種議題，以確保監管行動更加協調有效。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局進行了25項現場及非現場主題檢查，以及15項認可機構的非現場監察。 這些涵蓋了投資產品銷售、處理證券交易結算及客戶證券安全保管，以及銷售非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品和MPF相關產品，涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶。\n\n8月，香港金融管理局向認可機構發行通函，提供有關在向客戶銷售NLTI產品時的適當性評估和產品資訊披露的指引。此指引旨在協助認可機構遵守監管標準，包括保險事務專員公署和香港保險業聯會於7月發行的有關規定。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與金融服務及庫務局在《2014年保險公司（修訂）條例草案》的立法工作中密切合作，以設立獨立的保險權限及為保險中介人建立法定發牌制度。7 月，立法會通過了《2015年保險公司（修訂）條例》，其中發牌規定金融管理局透過授權，就認可機構的保險中介活動進行檢查及調查。\n\n金管局處理了六項成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一項RIs提出的增發的受規管活動申請。金管局授予了204名負責監督RIs證券活動的主管同意，並對RIs提交的9,697名人士的資料進行背景審查，以供納入金管局維持的登記冊。\n\n# 財務活動監督\n\n認可機構的流動性風險管理仍然是香港金融管理局的首要監管重點，尤其鑑於預期美國的利率將會正常化，以及隨之而來的資金流向逆轉的潛在可能性，這可能對認可機構的流動性狀況造成影響。全 2015 年，香港金融管理局繼續落實對認可機構的強化穩定資金要求，以維持充足的穩定資金來支持其貸款業務。自 2015 年 1 月 1 日巴塞爾三協議流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）推行以來，香港金融管理局一直在監控一類機構的流動性覆蓋比率水平和趨勢，這些機構的流動性覆蓋比率普遍維持在百分之一百或以上，良好地高於 2015 年階段性安排下的法定最低要求 60%。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局進行部分認可機構的控制架構主題現場檢查，以管理與預期利率正常化相關的風險。在市場波動下，香港金融管理局亦貼近關注突然市場變化及其對銀行業及個別認可機構的影響，並採取適當後續行動。\n\n# 由管理層主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n香港金融管理局繼續進行由監管機構主導的自下而上的壓力測試計劃，以更好了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟情況下的韌性，並鼓勵它們發展計劃以解決潛在問題。今年提交了數目優化措施，以收集更細緻的資料，從而對部分範疇的風險動態獲得深入了解。香港金融管理局分析了參與的認可機構提交的結果，並與它們討論如何進一步優化壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n過去幾年觀察到的強勁信貸成長趨勢，自2015年下半年以來已趨緩。整體而言，銀行業總貸款增加3.5%，對比2014年的12.7%（表2）。由於客戶存款增長速度加快於銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率從去年的72.2%降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，需要更緊密的國際合作與溝通以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及區域會議，並不遺餘力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化來進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港強勁的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現繼續獲得信貸評級機構認可，標準普爾維持對香港的頂級AAA評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，就攸關全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題貢獻力量。7 月，其擔任亞洲金融穩定委員會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）的共同主席一職，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定委員會成員與非成員之間的互動，鼓勵推行金融改革，並增進對金融穩定議題的意見交流。香港金融管理局繼續與東盟+3 當局密切工作，強化東盟+3 宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作——該辦公室已升格為國際組織——以監察及分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決定。\n\n在本年，香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行因多項市場因素而有所收縮。然而，市場仍維持有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易量則維持穩定增長。此外，日益增長的人民幣業務在香港進行，促進了國際貨幣基金組織對人民幣的肯定，認定其為自由使用的貨幣。國際貨幣基金組織的決定包括將其納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將帶動人民幣國際化以及香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及效率運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢方面發揮重要角色。香港人民幣支付系統的交易額在2015年創下新高，而場外衍生產品的交易報庫繼續支持實體按照於7月提交的新場外衍生產品市場監管制度的規定，報告其場外衍生產品交易。\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年進一步增強香港的金融基礎設施，包括新增多項組成部分及服務，當中12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著現時已有超過150間銀行可透過互聯網及流動渠道為其客戶收取及處理電子支票。電子帳單及繳費（EBPP）服務於2013年推出，至2015年繼續見證商戶參與增加。7月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）在其基金訂單路由服務下推出服務，以支持內地與香港互認基金（MRF）的推行。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦於11月啟動《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO），藉此優化相關制度。根據《PSSVFO》，香港金融管理局獲賦權落實多用途儲值支付工具的強制許可制度，並執行有關監管及執法功能，同時指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全及效率運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫日益增加，香港金融管理局積極推動與其他管轄區的合作，透過包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC）等國際及區域會議，以助發展可持續的經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦繼續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以應付強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局於7月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）區域諮詢組（RCG(A)）的共同主席，並於10月在香港舉辦其第九次會議。RCG(A)擔當重要平台，讓FSB成員與非成員就金融穩定事宜進行溝通與合作。來自16個亞洲管轄區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高層代表參加了會議，討論地區面臨的風險、日益增加的資產管理活動的影響、操守風險及存款保險計劃的經驗。香港金融管理局亦於8月共同擔任主席舉辦一場關於香港宏觀審慎政策的研討會。該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）舉辦，並有來自全球18個中央銀行的代表參加。與會者分享了他們在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點包括工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的效應。香港金融管理局亦與英倫銀行及國際貨幣基金組織共同舉辦了一場會議，探討央行及其他政策制定者在選擇最佳貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了超過一百名參加者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 以助發展亞洲貨幣與金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局維持對區域合作措施的承諾，以促進亞洲金融穩定，並凝聚該地區在國際金融事務中的集體聲音。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行管理層會議（EMEAP）下設立的貨幣及金融穩定委員會宏觀監察工作協調員，香港金融管理局繼續編製委員會每半年一次的宏觀監察報告，以評估該地區的風險與不穩定因素及政策影響。作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組主席，香港金融管理局與副主席密切合作，協調小組不遺餘力分享經驗和交流風險管理、監管、標準和最優惠實踐，以及國內和跨境支付與結算系統的發展。它亦領導了工作小組關於跨境合作與發展的分組。香港金融管理局於6月在香港舉辦了EMEAP與國際結算銀行外匯市場論壇和EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議。來自該地區和主要經濟體的17個主管機構的代表參加了會議，檢討了金融市場和金融監管改革的最新發展。\n\n繼去年香港與東盟+3 當局簽訂 AMRO 協議後，AMRO 於 2016 年 2 月 升格為國際組織，以支持其在增強的清邁倡議多邊化中的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與國際信貸評級機構維持貼近對話，以呈報香港經濟表現和財政實力的平衡評估。 這些努力促進了2015年所有主要信貸評級機構對香港信用評級的肯定。 標準普爾肯定香港的最高AAA評級，反映該機構對香港作為高收入經濟體，擁有高於平均水平的經濟展望、龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現以及強勁的淨外部資產地位的肯定。 穆迪投資者服務和惠譽評級亦分別維持香港的評級為Aa1和AA+，僅低一級別於AAA。\n\n# 香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務中心\n\n在 2015 年，市場因素對香港人民幣池產生影響。年底，未償還的人民幣客戶存款和存款憑證達到人民幣 1,010 億元，對比一年前的 1,158 億元（圖 1）。在內地市場利率下跌下，離岸人民幣債券發行放緩。結果，在香港發行的人民幣債券下降至人民幣 75 億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易擴大 9% 至人民幣 6,833 億元。人民幣銀行貸款餘額亦增加 58% 按年計至人民幣 297 億元（圖 2）。人民幣實時總結算（RTGS）系統的平均每日成交額增至人民幣 947 億元，較 2014 年上升 29%。與此同時，香港的離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步增長，調查結果顯示，截至 2015 年 4 月底的每日成交額約為等值 930 億美國元，較 2013 年 4 月最後一次 BIS 三年期調查時增加 88%。香港仍然是最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，市場具有相當的深度和廣度。另一個強化此地位的重要發展是 7 月推行 MRF 計劃，擴大了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局擴大跨境人民幣資金流渠道的政策舉措，以及與業界合作優化香港人民幣金融平台，持續取得成果。6月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣業務結算銀行及參與銀行將容許在岸銀行間債券市場進行回购交易並將所得資金匯出境外，以增進離岸市場銀行的人民幣流動性管理。9月，PBoC放寬跨境人民幣現金池管理規則，使更多跨國公司能在簡化安排下進行集團內資金轉移。內地當局亦於7月授予外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金較廣泛的岸內銀行間債券市場准入權，並於9月進一步開放內地外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n11 月 30 日，國際貨幣基金組織宣布決定，自 2016 年 10 月 1 日生效，將人民幣包括在特別提款權貨幣籃子中。此決定肯定了人民幣的地位，作為一種可自由使用的貨幣，並進一步推動了全球交易中使用人民幣的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化，以及內地與全球經濟金融體系聯繫增強所帶來的新機會中受益。\n\n香港繼續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同舉辦第三人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五人民幣業務論壇，並與馬來西亞及泰國第二次合作，促進私人部門就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些措施，香港銀行轉強了與其他市場的人民幣業務流動及聯網，這將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強其市場推廣工作，透過參與香港及海外市場包括加拿大、日本及非洲的行業活動，促進公司及機構在貿易、投資及融資方面較廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁余偉文先生在2015年12月11日香港與倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間發言。\n\n# 更緊密經貿關係安排\n\n中國內地與香港之間達成一項新協議，於11月在《更緊密經貿關係安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署，以達到服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年廣東提交的大部分試點自由化措施擴展至全國範圍。根據新協議，原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，預計將為這些銀行在內地進行業務時提供更多政策確定性和較大靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行業監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。此外，除了處理中央銀行和一般風險管理的課程外，內容還包括消費者保護、信用職權範圍、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健性指標分析，以及系統性風險監測。亦為來自海外銀行和執法機構的代表團進行課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n年內，本港金管局安排了八次機構政府債券的投標，金額為204億本港元。截至2015年底，未償還機構債券的總金額為689億本港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based

儲備管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未見的挑戰。在例如艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境下，外匯基金在2015年的整體投資回報為-0.6%，但其虧損相對溫和，與主要市場指數及可比較的投資基金相比，這歸功於香港金融管理局在過去數年所調配的一系列防禦部署，這些部署提升了外匯基金的韌性。\n\n# 兌換基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》訂明，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可被用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以應付香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長控制，並在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（外匯基金諮詢委員會）後，可投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會已制定繼以下投資目標：\n\n（a）保障資本；\n（b）確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候均能全面由流通性極高的美國貨幣單位資產作為後盾；\n（c）確保有充足流動性可得，以維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的；以及\n（d）在（a）至（c）的前提下，達到投資回報，以應付保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標採用十足考慮外匯基金的法定目的，並納入基金的組合結構和目標資產配置。\n\n大致而言，外匯基金擁有兩主要投資組合—支持投資組合和投資組合。支持投資組合持有流通性極高的美國貨幣計價資產，以提供十足的支持給貨幣基礎，以符合貨幣板安排的規定。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股權市場，以保障資產的價值和長期的購買力。這兩項投資組合整體而言的長期目標債券對股權比例為72:28。在目標貨幣配置方面，81%的資產分配給美國貨幣和香港貨幣，其餘19%分配給其他貨幣。\n\n為更好管理風險並優化中長期回報，香港金融管理局已以謹慎且循序漸進的有序方式，將部分發行基金的投資分散投資到多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券及股票、私人股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券及股票由投資組合持有，而私人股權及物業投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。香港金融管理局在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持於發行基金累積結餘的三分之一。截至年底2015年，LTGP下投資的市場價值總計為1,421億本港元，包括913億本港元的私人股權及508億本港元的物業投資，並有1,224億本港元的投資承諾未履行。\n\n策略性投資組合於2007年設立，旨在持有政府為交易所基金的帳戶而收購的香港交易所及結算有限公司股份。由於此投資組合的性質特殊，故未將其包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程分別以兩種資產分配的決定為基礎—策略性資產分配和戰略性資產分配。策略性資產分配反映在投資基準中，顯示鑑於外匯基金的投資目標所制定的長期最佳資產分配。在策略性分配的指引下，資產會戰略性地分配，以爭取超越基準的超額回報。這通常意思是實際分配與基準或策略性分配不同。實際分配與基準分配之間的差異被稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準和戰略性偏離的上限由財政司長諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定，但戰略性決策是由香港金融管理局在授權權限下作出。於容許的戰略性偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可採用策略以利用短期市場走勢獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部門直接管理約76%的交換基金投資，包括整體支持投資組合及投資組合的部分。這部分投資組合包括制定一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及各種衍生工具組合推行宏觀風險管理策略，以管理基金。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦聘請設於多個國際金融中心的外部基金經理，管理約24%的交換基金資產，包括其全部上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產。聘請外部經理的目的，是運用市場上可得的最優惠專業投資技術，捕捉多元化的投資風格，並將市場的知識和資訊轉移至內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人有關的支出包括基金管理費用和托管費用、交易成本以及預扣稅和其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素決定，且每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。已為內部及外聘管理的投資組合設立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監察對指引和規則的遵循情況。風險控制工具被調配用以在正常及不利情況下評估市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以最佳運用內部及外聘經理的投資技能。\n\n# 兌換基金的表現\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動極高。尤其股市遇到前所未見的動盪。主要股市在上半年達到新高。然而，市場情緒在第3季急轉直下，帶來對中國內地經濟增長的憂慮，主要股市因而失守自年初以來的收益，並錄得顯著的季度虧損。其後，隨着市場情緒改善，全球股市稍為回升，但朝向年底再度惡化。由於與中國內地經濟貼近，香港股市在2015年遜於其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場上，儘管預期美國利率正常化以及美國利率上行週期的開始，2015年較長期美國國債收益率仍適度上升，因為正數情緒受到對全球經濟增長的憂慮、持續的全球通縮壓力以及升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢所遏抑。另一方面，由於歐洲央行大力實施貨幣寬鬆政策，短期歐洲政府債券收益率下跌，甚至有部分跌至負面區域。\n\n在貨幣市場上，2015年美元指數在美國政策利率正常化預期下繼續強化，飆升接近10%。歐元在首季顯著削弱，自1999年面世以來，創下最大的單季跌幅，原因是歐洲央行於1月宣布量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在2015年對美元大致平穩。\n\n主要貨幣、債券和股票市場在二〇一五年的表現載於表1。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 聯匯基金的表現\n\n在極其波動的金融市場及艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境情況下，證券投資基金於2015年錄得投資虧損158億本港元，包括海外股票收益71億本港元、香港股票虧損50億本港元、債券收益159億本港元、非美元資產的負面貨幣轉作影響449億本港元，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益111億本港元。此負面貨幣轉作影響是無可避免的，因去年美國美元急升，將證券投資基金的非美元投資換算為本港元時所產生。另一方面，策略性投資組合錄得評值收益22億本港元。\n\n香港儲備基金的總資產在2015年底達到34,229億港元。香港儲備基金在2015年的投資回報（不包括策略性組合）為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現較遜色的主要市場指數及整體投資基金社會對比，香港儲備基金的虧損可考慮為溫和。為預期投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局在過去幾年已調配了一系列防禦性部署，包括縮短債券組合的年期、日益增加現金持有量，以及顯著減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化的步伐，特別是透過長期投資計劃下的投資。這些部署增強了香港儲備基金的韌性，並有助減少一些潛在虧損。\n\n基金自

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

公司職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公共教育計劃及各種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以增進對其政策及運作的了解。於2015年，香港金融管理局優化企業管治，透過推動員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安及重整高層管理職責，以應付推行新計劃及系統所帶來的挑戰，以及日益繁重的工作。\n\n# 參與社會企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體密切合作，以改善透明度並促進公眾對其政策和工作 的理解。2015年，共舉辦59場公開媒體活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14場站立式訪問及31項其他公眾活動。另外安排了43場媒體訪問，發行了325份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為優化公眾對香港金融管理局的關鍵功能的認識，舉辦了兩場媒體參觀，分別前往香港鈔票印刷有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL），以展示香港的世界級鈔票印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時進行了有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及發行基金的教育研討會，為媒體提供這些重要議題更深入的簡介。\n\n香港金融管理局首席執行官陳德霖先生（中央）及執行董事（貨幣管理）李浩華先生（右）到訪香港印鈔有限公司，視察鈔票的安全特性。\n\n在香港銀行同業結算有限公司舉行的媒體參觀期間，進行了自動支票分類演示。在圖的中間（從左至右）是香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖先生；財務基礎設施執行董事李志明先生；以及香港銀行同業結算有限公司行政總裁唐學恆女士。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供了一個有效途徑，以取得香港金融管理局的資訊，使他們更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務在2015年處理了9,078宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢涉及銀行政策及法規、紙幣及硬幣，以及消費者銀行業務問題。顯著的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收藏計劃。\n\n圖 1 顯示自 2012 年以來接獲的公眾查詢數目，圖 2 發牌 2015 年公眾查詢的性質分類。\n\n圖1總數目公眾查詢\n\n# 刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，香港金融管理局過去一年內載於兩期《上半年貨幣及金融穩定報告》，四期《季度通訊》，並定期提供《月度統計通報》最新資料，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇深入了解文章，涵蓋各種熱門及適時的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局2014年報告接獲香港管理協會2015年最佳年度報告獎項的「非牟利令及慈善機構」類別的銅獎項。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk），提供超過五萬頁的英文、傳統中文及簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有《銀行條例》第20條維持的「認可機構（AIs）證券從業員登記冊」及「認可機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值設施條例》的推行，網站亦會載有根據該條例的儲值設施牌照持有人登記冊。為引起公眾對重要及適時資訊的關注，網站已提供專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，例如提醒公眾需保持警覺以應對詐騙來電，以及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣收集車的位置等資訊。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公共教育計畫\n\n香港金融管理局位於國際金融中心二期55樓的資訊中心，是引入香港金融管理局工作至社會及以助發展公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的意識的重要資源。該中心包括展覽區及圖書館，並為公眾啟用六天。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展。它包括閱讀宣傳資料和展品，以研究香港的貨幣、銀行和金融事務。\n\n資訊中心為訪客舉辦導賞參觀。本年，中心接獲超過48,300名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦超過630次參觀（圖3）。自2003年12月開放以來，已有超過530,400人參觀資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區毗鄰，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他刊物，以詳細研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行主題。圖書館亦根據銀行條例第20條的規定，保持香港認可機構的電子登記冊。\n\n為持續向社會拓展服務，香港金融管理局繼續舉辦公眾教育研討會。於2015年，為約2,300名二手學校學生及教師舉辦了3場研討會。議題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智醒使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年推出以來，已有超過54,700人參與了該計劃。\n\n圖3 團體參觀資訊中心的種類\n\n學童訪客在指引下參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣及銀行業的發展。\n\n中學校學生和老師參與一場公開教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招聘、培訓及維持一支高度專業的工作隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對工作重點的變化。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的一部分，但其能夠以與公務員制度不同的條件聘用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗及專業投資技術的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局的目標是保持精簡靈活的架構，並調配人力資源以推行新措施，滿足增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n繼《支付系統及儲值設施條例》的生效後，香港金融管理局於 2015 年 12 月在貨幣管理部門（MMD）下成立新的零售支付監察部，以履行香港金融管理局在儲值設施及其他零售支付系統的牌照發出及日常監管方面的法定職責。為優化部門之間的協同效應，並重新調配員工資源以應付推行新措施所帶來 的挑戰，以及日益繁重的工作量和工作複雜性，於 2015 年計劃對數目部門的職務進行調整，並於 2016 年初推行。詳情因應如下：\n\n金融基建部（FID）接管了法規部（enFD）負責的存款保障計劃行政工作及結算功能，亦從MMD的貨幣科接管了相關職責。此外，金融基建部亦接管了銀行業部門若干銀行業相關工作，例如消費者教育、董事發展及加強銀行從業員的能力建構框架。\n\n外部部門接管了MMD的市場開發功能，而後者將繼續與國庫市場協會及金融基準有關的工作；並\n\n法規部接管了銀行監理部門的反洗錢及金融犯罪風險部門，並重新命名為執法及反洗錢部門。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 人手編制\n\n香港金融管理局於2015年成立時，職位數為841個。至2016年增加34個，增至875個（增加4%），以確保提供充足資源應付（i）新法例及措施的推行，（ii）持續進行已證明為必要之試點項目，以及（ii）現行工作的日益繁重和工作量增加。新職位已調配至以下職能：\n\n加強銀行和金融穩定，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場檢查、推行國際銀行標準及同儕審查活動；\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監管；\n\n推行有關透過銀行及獲批准經紀商進行的場外衍生工具監管框架，以及新生效的場外衍生工具報告及記錄保存規則；\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法努力；\n\n加緊規劃與籌備推行《金融機構（解決）法案》，該法案採用國際標準以解決金融業的「大到不能倒閉」問題；\n\n透過發展針對銀行獨立非執行董事的董事賦權計劃，以促進銀行業的能力建設，進一步改善銀行的治理，並與業界合作促進銀行從業人員在銀行運作核心範疇的專業能力框架提升。\n\n加強新銀行、證券及保險產品的銀行行為政策與研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；以及\n\n加強監測及分析在岸人民幣市場的發展，以推動香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對與未來基金成立相關的豐富投資活動的投資、風險管理及法律支持，並在日益艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境下，加強策略性資產配置及投資流程，鑑於交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化。\n\n推行新的法定制度，賦權香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監管儲值設施和零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 公司職能\n\n臨時資源被調配以滿足其他工作需求。香港金融管理局將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（國際貨幣基金組織）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助香港或香港金融管理局感興趣的活動或措施。部分員工以全職或兼職形式被調配，以提供運作支援予香港存款保障局及財政市場協會。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）在現行市場薪酬水平及慣例下，經外匯基金諮詢委員會（eFAC）的建議，透過治理小組委員會（GSC）決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務情況。薪酬包括總現金包及公積金計劃，實物效益基本。現金包包括每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬，浮動薪酬可根據個人表現，每年一次以總額頒發予個別員工，取決於當年表現。\n\n香港金管局員工的薪酬，每年由財政司司長根據外匯基金諮詢委員會（eFAC）透過GSC提出的建議進行檢討，並考慮GSC對香港金管局上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融界薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他有關因素。為維持員工的薪酬競爭力，可不時對表現卓越的個別員工作出特別薪酬調整。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬或浮動薪酬獎項的調整，均按員工的表現分配給個別員工。香港金融管理局的投資專業人員會面對一個旨在強化其投資表現與薪酬獎項之間聯繫的浮動薪酬制度。職級為執行董事或以上的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎項，由財政司司長根據財務委員會的建議批准。相關員工在討論其薪酬時並不在場。職級為部門主管或以下的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎項，由香港金融管理局總裁根據財政司司長的授權，於批准的整體薪酬獎項範圍內制定。\n"}

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 審計主任報告\n\n# 審計署\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n我證明我已審核了外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）於第 134 至 222 頁所載的財務報表，包括外匯基金及本集團於 2015 年 12 月 31 日的資產負債表，以及截至該年的收益及支出帳目、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包含重要會計政策概要及其他解釋性資料。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣權限負責根據行政長官根據《發鈔兌換基金條例》（第7條）及香港財務報告準則所作出的指示，準備提供真實且公允觀點的財務報表，並負責貨幣權限認為必要以確保財務報表無重大錯誤陳述，無論是因詐欺或錯誤所致的內部控制。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是基於我的審計，對這些財務報表發表意見。我根據行政長官根據《香港發鈔兌換基金條例》第7條所包括的指示，以及審計委員會的審計準則進行了審計。這些準則要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃和執行審計以取得合理的保證，財務報表是否免費存在重大錯報。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以取得有關財務報表數額及披露的審計證據。所選定的程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是由於欺詐或錯誤所致。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師認為與實體編製真實公允的財務報表有關的內部控制，以設計適當於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對該實體的內部控制的成效發表意見。審計亦包括評估所使用的會計政策的適當性，以及貨幣當局所作的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈現方式。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據是充足且適當的，足以作為我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計長報告（繼續）\n\n# 意見\n\n依我之見，財務報表根據香港財務報告準則，真實而公允地反映了2015年12月31日交易所基金及其集團的財務狀況，以及該年的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據《交易所基金條例》第7條所包括的行政長官指示妥為編製。\n\n孫大衛\n審計總監\n\n2016 年 4 月 7 日\n\n審計署\n26樓\n入境事務大樓\n告士打道7號\n灣仔，香港\n\n#

主要業務\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（基金）主管所授權的權限，根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動是保障香港貨幣的匯價，並維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全。\n\n基金的資產由四個組合管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略組合。支持組合的資產全面匹配香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及不動產投資。策略組合持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略性目的而收購。營運部門資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 第2節 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，香港財務報告準則是一個統稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港會計師公會（HKiCpA）發行的詮釋，以及香港普遍公認的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（一同稱為本集團）所採納的重要會計政策概要制定如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行若干新的及修訂的香港財務報告準則，首輪生效或可得提早採用，適用於現行會計期間。附註3發牌有關這些發展，因此對會計政策產生變動（如有），並反映於這些財務報表所反映的現行及之前期間，以供本集團參考。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註（繼續）\n\n數額以百萬港元列示，除非另有說明。\n\n# 22 財務報表編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司和合資企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要業務載於附註16和17。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除下列資產及負債以公允價值計外，詳見下述會計政策所制定。\n\n交易金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n指定按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n金（附註 2.11）；及\n投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，要求管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的匯報數額。這些估計和相關假設是基於經驗和各種因素，認為在情況下是合理的，其結果構成判斷資產和負債攜帶價值的基礎，而這些價值並非其他資料來源容易顯現。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及基本假設持續檢討。會計估計的修訂若僅影響該期間，則於該期間認可；若影響現行及未來期間，則於修訂期間及未來期間認可。\n\n附註18包含投資性房地產公允價值估算的假設。附註37包含金融工具公允價值估算的假設。除附註2.5所述若干金融工具的估值外，集團會計政策的應用不涉及關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團控制一實體，係指集團因與該實體的參與而有權獲得浮動回報，或因參與該實體而面臨浮動回報，且能透過對該實體的控制權影響該回報。在評估集團是否具有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他各方持有）。\n\n# 財政儲備 – 財務報表附註（繼續）\n\n數額以百萬港元列示，除非另有說明。\n\n對子公司的投資自控制實施之日起，至控制終止之日止，併入集團財務報表。\n\n在編製集團財務報表時，集團內公司之間的結餘、交易及現金流量，以及任何源於集團內交易的未實現利潤及虧損，均會被十足消除。\n\n非控制權益代表子公司中未直接或間接歸屬於基金的股權，且集團與該等權益持有人之間未協議任何增發的條款，致使集團整體對該等權益負有符合財務負債定義的契約義務。非控制權益於集團資產負債表中以權益項目呈交，與歸屬於基金所有者的權益另一方面區分開來。集團的結果中，非控制權益於集團損益表及綜合收益表中以分配當年總綜合收益或虧損予非控制權益與基金所有者的方面呈現。\n\n基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資以成本減去減值損失計，如有（注意 2.14）。\n\n# 2.4% 關聯企業與合資企業\n\n聯營公司是指集團對其管理具有重大影響力，但並未控制或共同控制的實體，其影響力源於集團參與該實體的財務及營運政策決策的權力。\n"}
