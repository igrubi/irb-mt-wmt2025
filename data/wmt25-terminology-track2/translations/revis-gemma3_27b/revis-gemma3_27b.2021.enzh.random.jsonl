{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over

行政長官聲明\n\n2021年是同時整固與發展的一年。\n\n2021年，疫情踏入第二年，並未見緩解：全球供應鏈受到干擾，通貨膨脹壓力上升，全球金融條件過早收緊的風險上升。加上COVID-19變異株的出現與地緣政治緊張局勢的升溫，增添了不確定性。儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性，我們仍繼續保障貨幣與金融穩定，並維持營運韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來復甦的希望，得益於COVID-19疫苗的成功推出，以及多個經濟體推出的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟開始從2020年的嚴重收縮中恢復。本地方面，在經歷了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟在2021年增長了6.3%，受惠於疫苗接種計劃的推出和政府的疫情援助措施，這些措施提供至關重要的支持，以促進我們的經濟復甦。\n\n在金融和貨幣穩定維持，以及宏觀環境穩定的情況下，2021年為我們提供了發展工作的空間。我們把握機會，積極推進發展的舉措，以協助我們的金融界維持高度的競爭力。在三大戰略重點領域，即金融科技、綠色金融以及香港作為橋樑所產生的內地市場機會方面，已作出顯著進展。\n\n踏入2022年，全球環境變得更加惡化。但有云，當處境艱難時，堅強的人會迎難而上。我們將繼續主動，追求發展的目標與優先事項，以更好地準備應對下一步的挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅定不移地確保香港貨幣與金融體系的穩健，正如我們在過去多次應對很多挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基礎\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港金融體系的強大支柱，有助香港抵禦無數衝擊和挑戰。儘管COVID-19疫情造成的持續不確定性以及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮，香港美元匯兌及貨幣市場全年繼續有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n我們對體系的信心並非一朝一夕就能建立，而是以多年來穩健的基礎為基礎。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年《外部部門報告》中再次重申，LERS的可信度已透過一套透明的規則、充裕的財政和外匯儲備、強健的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及謹慎的財政框架得到保障。\n\n信心亦是我們在公眾及市場互動方面的努力，以及有效監測的結果。在後者方面，我們借助科技與數據分析，加強了對金融穩定及宏觀審慎監測的及時且全面分析能力。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。自COVID-19疫情爆發以來兩年，我們的銀行仍然表現良好，流動性狀況及資本充足率均符合國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足率高達20.2%，遠高於最低要求的8%；而大型銀行在2021年第四季度的平均流動性保障率為151.9%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。儘管疫情隨着充滿挑戰的信貸環境，銀行業的資產質量在本年大致保持穩定。行業的分類貸款比率在2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的重要支柱\n\n一如既往，銀行業是支持經濟活動的重要支柱。鑑於新冠肺炎爆發所帶來的經濟後果，這更是至關重要。過去一年，主要挑戰是於管理銀行業的信貸風險與維持該行業對實體經濟的支持之間取得平衡。憑藉多年來的監管工作，銀行持續有效管理信貸風險。與此同時，我們與銀行緊密合作，透過預批本金償還寬限計劃（PPPHS）及其他寬限措施，向企業及個人客戶提供所需的支持。PPPHS於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制一同推出，讓合資格的企業客戶可在批核的前提下延後貸款本金償還6個月，並於2021年兩度延長至2022年4月，鑑於部分經濟領域仍經營環境艱難，需要持續的信貸寬限。其後，鑑於本地冠狀病毒感染反彈，於2022年2月，PPPHS進一步延長至2022年10月底。令人鼓勵的是，銀行業已攜手香港金融管理局協助減輕企業及個人借款人的資金周轉壓力，即使該行業本身正因疫情爆發而面臨自身的艱難營運狀況。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境，疫情亦帶來更困難的營運環境，以及持續增加的網路威脅所構成的數位環境。我們已加強提升銀行業營運及網路韌性，隨着數位化增加和釣魚詐騙急升，亦提升消費者及投資者保障。特別是，銀行業做法守則已修訂，以提升數位金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n此外，除了監管工作外，我們致力於推動銀行業的金融包容性及以客戶為中心的文化。增強有需要客戶對銀行服務的方便使用，一直是我們的工作重點，我們亦一直與業界緊密合作，制訂行業指引。除了無障礙銀行服務的指引，以及為智障人士提供銀行服務的指引外，業界在香港金融管理局的支持下，於2021年12月發出一份指引，以建立銀行業為患有認知障礙症人士及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好做法。\n\n為支持銀行業未來持續發展，面對新的增長機會和挑戰，需要勞動力具備一套新的技能，香港金融管理局已制定全面的人才發展策略——「聯繫人才與未來」，以更系統化和專項的方式培育未來人才，並提升現有從業員的技能。我們的新策略建立於三個「聯繫」方向：聯繫學生與銀行業、聯繫從業員與銀行業的未來，以及聯繫關鍵持份者一同提升策略實施的協作。我們已推出一系列外展及宣傳活動，以吸引更多學生進入銀行業。為更好準備大學學生，讓他們具備未來所需的準備，我們聯同香港銀行家協會推出「未來銀行橋接計劃」，該計劃包括一系列課程，涵蓋實用的銀行知識及高度需求的軟技能。對於現有銀行從業員，我們一直與業界緊密合作，發展更多提供在職培訓的機會。於2021年12月，銀行從業員加強能力框架下的新金融科技模組正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與所有持份者共同努力，鑑於加強業界的人才儲備，以促進其進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強勢地位由無可比擬的機會支撐。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，是由其提供的無可比擬的機會所支撐。各界普遍達成共識，認為全球金融科技的採用、內地金融市場的開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的主流化，為香港金融業的未來發展呈現巨大機會。在香港金融管理局，我們致力於利用香港獨特的優勢，把握這些機會。讓我介紹金融科技及內地的機會，作為首個話題。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情已清楚顯示金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為了使我們繼續暫停終止權於全球金融科技的領先地位，並準備就緒挖掘金融科技的全部潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓金融科技的價值在所有層面都能被體驗。\n\n此願景由於促使我們制定一項新策略「金融科技2025」，該策略於2021年6月公布。正如其名稱所示，該策略旨在協助金融業全面應用科技，以爭取在2025年實現相關目標。該策略包括五個重點範疇，涵蓋實現成功生態系統所需的要素，亦包括生態系統在生生不息的循環中進一步增長的正確因素。策略的首兩個部分，即「所有銀行進行金融科技」和「加深研究香港在中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDCs）方面的準備工作」，主要旨在創造更多金融科技應用的需求。策略的其他部分則與數據、基礎設施、人才和資金有關，這些都是生態系統增長的重要要素。\n\n根據此策略，推出了一系列新舉措，例如廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA）金融科技先導測試設施，該設施允許金融機構和科技公司進行先導測試，並從監管機構和用戶那裡獲取盡早的回饋，以評估其跨境金融科技舉措；以及商業數據交換的先導推出，該交換利用替代數據來促進中小企業融資。我們亦加強了對批發央行數字貨幣（CBDC）應用於跨境支付的研究，並探討電子港元（e-HKD）的前景，這將提升香港採納央行數字貨幣的準備，並轉變我們的城市在未來數十年的金融基礎設施，使其更具韌性，以應對未來的挑戰。\n\n在我們把握科技進步所帶來的新的機會的同時，亦繼續建立在我們現有的成果之上，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，於2018年推出的較快支付系統（FPS）經過過去幾年的迅速發展，登記數目於2021年底達到960百萬，較去年上升40%。每日平均交易額亦上升九成，從2020年的水平達到2021年的約673,000即時交易。另一方面，鑑於加密資產，尤其用作支付用途的穩定幣的迅速發展，我們在本年初已推出一份討論文件，以邀請市場回饋，探討制定合適的監管框架。\n\n我們的全新、具前瞻性的策略將建立有利於金融科技生態系統健康發展的基礎。 隨著銀行業日益採納金融科技以把握其提供的機會，這最終將惠及金融機構和香港市民，同時加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為通往內地的具主導地位的門戶\n\n香港一如既往地在連接內地市場與國際金融市場方面發揮著戰略作用，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，以進行各種金融、投資和財富管理活動。國家「十四五」規劃強化了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。這與全球經濟趨勢一同強化了我們的信心，相信香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場的獨特價值。\n\n2021年，我們在增強聯繫方面達成一個里程碑，加上兩項新成員加入我們的Connect計劃系列，即粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通（跨境WMC）計劃，以及債券通下的南向交易，本質上完善了包括股票、債務和理財管理在內的廣泛金融市場範疇的雙向互聯互通。這兩項計劃的推出將為香港帶來各種方面的全新機會。透過滿足內地投資者增加的多元化需要，這兩項計劃將擴大我們債券市場和財富管理行業的客戶基礎。我很高興見到這兩項計劃運作順利。香港金融管理局將繼續與內地當局保持聯繫，以便隨著時間的推移，進一步提升這些計劃。\n"}

2021年摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n2021年，香港經濟在強勁的貨物出口下回復正增長，國內需求回升，並受政府支持性政策措施的推動。勞動市場亦改善，雖然通脹微升，但保持溫和。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩定，資本及流動性狀況良好。資產質素按歷史及國際標準而言皆維持健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港美元市場繼續暢順有序地運作，儘管持續存在新型冠狀病毒疫情的不確定性及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮。聯繫匯率制度繼續良好運作。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n隨著全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑，外匯基金錄得港元1,919億的投資收入，相當於4.1%的投資回報率。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續支持負責任投資和資產多元化。長期增長投資組合自2009年成立以來，錄得年化內部收益率為15.4%。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續重點放在銀行風險管理的監管上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及數字化加快，香港金融管理局已加強對銀行營運及網絡韌性的監管。銀行業守則亦已修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保障。\n\n經過廣泛諮詢，廣東–香港–澳門大灣區跨境財富管理通關（跨境WMC）試點計劃已順利推出。香港金融管理局提供指引，協助銀行透過非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，以確保良好的客戶體驗，並按照規定提供保障。\n\n在打擊洗錢和反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，香港金管局的工作重點是進一步加強銀行防止和偵測疫情期間因網絡金融犯罪上升而出現的非法資金流動的能力。香港金管局亦深化了透過公私合作夥伴關係的信息分享，同時支持遠程客戶開戶，並鼓勵採用包括網絡分析在內的各項科技，透過推出首個AML Regtech實驗室來實現。\n\n在軟性基礎設施方面作出進一步努力，包括銀行文化和人才發展範疇。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準已達致良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露。香港金融管理局亦推進制定解決方案標準，進行解決方案規劃，並發展解決方案執行能力，以確保銀行具公信力的解決方案制度。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局公布其「Fintech 2025」策略，以推動金融界廣泛採用Fintech，並加強香港作為亞洲Fintech中心的地位。在快速支付系統方面，其註冊量和交易額已顯著增長，使用情況持續擴大。\n\n在增強連通性方面，跨境WMC及債券通南向交易已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的角色。\n\n亦致力於締造新商務機會，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心，以及綠色及可持續金融等範疇。\n\n為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強向各種持份者進行市場推廣，讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所帶來的機遇。香港金融學院亦推出新金融領袖計劃，旨在培育香港未來的金融領袖。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過各種渠道保持與社群及市場的聯繫，以提升公眾對其政策及運作的認識。對內，香港金融管理局謹慎建立靈活應變且可持續的人力資源，建立嚴格的財務紀律，並提升資訊科技能力以應對變化，確保其政策及措施的有效落實。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated

2022年優先事項及前瞻\n\n全球及本地情況在進入2022年時明顯惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級及美國聯邦儲備局加息預期觸發市場波動；另一方面，本地經濟舉辦了新一波COVID-19疫情的衝擊。不過，鑑於香港金融體系具備多年建立的韌性及緩衝，其餘下財務體系仍能良好抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，香港金融管理局會繼續高度重視維持貨幣及金融穩定。為此，我們將努力暫停終止權先機，識別新興風險，並以靈活應變的方式作出回應。同時，香港金融管理局亦會尋求協助鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心地位的機會。在這複雜的投資環境下管理貨幣發行基金，香港金融管理局會繼續審慎投資，同時保持靈活，適時實施防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性與完整性\n\n全球經濟前景保持受制於重大不確定性。香港金管局將密切關注最新發展，並暫停終止權潛在風險，以維護金融體系的韌性與穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的重要金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕，防範潛力風險。\n\n展望未來，市場可能受制於隨着各種範疇的不確定性上升而加劇的波動。一方面，美國聯邦儲備委員會的貨幣政策正常化，若以快速的步伐繼續，可能在未來明顯地緊縮全球金融條件，並增加全球債務服務負擔。另一方面，鑑於2022年初烏克蘭情勢升級，包括中美緊張關係在內的地緣政治不確定性可能繼續保持高水準，並再次引發金融市場波動。最後但最少重要的是，隨着疫情發展的反覆，若大規模重新實施封鎖措施，可能導致全球供應瓶頸持續存在，並對全球增長與通脹產生不利影響。儘管如此，香港的金融體系鑑於多年來建立的韌性與緩衝，處於良好位置，足以抵禦不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦具備能力、資源及承諾，以保障香港的貨幣與金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續緊密監察本地及外部環境的風險和脆弱性，並準備就緒在必要時採取合適措施，以維持香港的貨幣和金融穩定。二零二二年的研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛在風險。另一方面，金管局持續的數碼化計劃將協助提升其監察能力，以支援對金融體系更全面的監察和分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定性\n\n隨著發達市場收緊貨幣政策，且疫情的影響持續，銀行業面對的信貸環境預期將持續充滿挑戰。與此同時，迅速的科技進步與數位化為銀行業呈現機遇與挑戰。面對不斷改變的金融環境，香港金融管理局致力透過持續的監管努力，確保銀行抵禦衝擊的能力。與此同時，香港金融管理局亦將繼續提升並完善其銀行監管及監管框架與政策，並採取國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將加強對銀行信貸風險敞口的監測，並推行主動措施，以確保整體風險水平保持良好可控。\n\n香港金融管理局亦將繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業經營狀況的影響，並維持與銀行及商業界密切對話，同時檢討各種援助措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n隨著2022年5月發佈新的監管政策手冊（SPM）「業務韌性」模組，香港金融管理局將繼續保持與業界的聯繫，並了解獲授權機構（AIs）在發展其業務韌性框架方面的進展。同時，香港金融管理局將尋求提升銀行業的網絡韌性，透過以下方式進行：跟進AIs在 Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0評估中所揭示的問題，以及監察AIs實施安全的第三層數據備份情況。另一項重要的監管重點將是評估及處理AIs對科技服務供應商越來越大的依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉加強的數字化能力和廣泛的遠程工作經驗，在疫情期間累積，一些人工智能正計劃以常態化的方式轉向混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將關注此發展，並評估相關風險是否已由業界充分應對。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n香港金管局將於2022年專注於監察人工智能的流動性及市場風險管理。特別是，香港金管局將繼續監察人工智能在過渡餘下倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）設置方面的進展，直至這些設置於2023年6月30日停止發出。\n\n# 打擊洗錢與恐怖主義融資\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的工作將繼續加強因應詐騙及金融犯罪的措施，透過合作與資訊共享，並與AML\/CFT生態系統中的各種持份者加強合作。其他重點包括實施更廣泛的風險敏感監管技術，利用加強的數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，以及推動銀行使用Regtech，包括交易監測系統。\n\n香港金融管理局亦會緊密與政府、銀行及儲值支付工具（SVF）業界合作，新增更新的香港洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估，並協助業界對抗新興風險。工作亦會繼續進行，以了解反覆出現的洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險，實施對AML法律及相關指引的變更，以配合國際標準，並維持與其他監管機構及國際標準制定者的主動參與。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2022年，香港金管局將會對人工智能在財富管理、證券銷售、強積金（MPF）及其他投資及保險產品方面的行為進行現場檢查及非現場監察，重點關注粵港澳大灣區「跨境財富管理連結」計劃（「跨境WMC」）、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產以及非投資連結長期保險產品。\n\n在維持與其他監管機構及銀行業接近聯繫的同時，香港金融管理局將就投資、保險及強積金產品的出售提供進一步指引。此指引將涵蓋在...之間的事項，包括與虛擬資產相關的投資服務及出售保護聯動計劃，一種新的投資連動保障計劃產品，具有高水平的保險保障。香港金融管理局、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局將聯同推出神秘購物計劃，以評估中介機構在方面銷售合資格延期年金保單及可扣稅自願供款的銷售實踐。\n\n以下暢順推出跨境WMC後，香港金融管理局將繼續參與業界及相關監管機構，以提升該計劃。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局將展開準備工作，以監管人工智能的信託業務，並採用新的SPM模組及新的行為守則。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）1，以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的各種指引，推動其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全與效率。該局將採取最新科技及市場發展，完善FMI監管框架。\n\n香港金融管理局將與金融市場基礎設施合作，就其遵守PFMI的情況進行並更新評估。此外，香港金融管理局將繼續參與CPMI-國際證監會組織的PFMI實施監測與評估工作。香港金融管理局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並因應市場及科技發展，按照國際方針加強其監管要求。香港金融管理局將與相關當局合作，在合適的情況下進一步加強協同監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續提升和完善其銀行監管框架和政策，並考慮國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾協議\n\n# 資本標準\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續提升資本框架，以落實近年來由巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）發出的標準，以下：\n\n2013年12月銀行對基金的股權投資資本要求（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日生效，隨《銀行（資本）（修訂）規則》2022年經立法會負面審查後開始運作。\n\n於2017年12月公布的巴塞爾三號最終危機後改革方案、2019年1月的市場風險最低資本要求（2019年2月修訂），以及2020年7月的專項修訂信用估值調整風險架構，這些均一般稱為「巴塞爾三號最終改革套件」。 這些修訂後的資本標準建立了信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整（CVA）風險及操作風險的修訂後資本處理方式，引入輸出底限要求，並提升槓桿比率框架。 為了使銀行（資本）規則（BCR）的修訂(條文)於2023年7月1日起生效作為最低要求，目前正與業界進行諮詢（除了市場風險及CVA風險2）。\n\n鑑於在 BCR 框架下，對主權集中風險的資本處理旨在補充巴塞爾委員會所實施的大型風險敞口框架，香港金融管理局將同時提出修訂(條文)資本規則，並與相關銀行（風險敞口限制）規則的變更同步進行。\n\n# 暴露限值\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續就建議修訂《銀行（風險敞口限制）規則》與業界及司法部進行諮詢，目標實施日期符合巴塞爾III最終改革套件的日期，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n新或修訂的披露要求，與巴塞爾 III 最終改革方案中修訂的資本標準相關，主要載於巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發出的《第三支柱三十三披露要求 – 更新框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《槓桿比率披露要求修訂》，修訂槓桿比率披露要求，以應對就潛力「粉飾帳目」（即銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的規模，以人為提高其報告及公眾披露的槓桿比率）的憂慮。為實施這些新或修訂的披露要求，亦正在準備相關的《銀行（披露）規則》修訂(條文)，鑑於讓這些修訂在香港與其相關的修訂資本標準的時序相符，以期推行生效。\n\n#

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart

經濟與金融環境\n\n在強勁的商品出口、內需回升，以及政府支持政策措施的推動下，香港經濟在2021年回復正增長，扭轉了2019年和2020年的收縮。勞動力市場亦改善，通脹仍然溫和，雖然微升。預期在第五波新冠疫情減退後，經濟復甦將繼續，但其強度和速度受制於不確定性和風險，尤其受疫情造成的以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n由於強勁的商品出口和改善的內需，香港經濟在2021年增長了6.3%，結束了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮（表1和圖1）。私人消費受惠於改善的勞動力市場狀況和政府消費券計劃的推動而復甦。整體投資開支亦反彈，反映營商環境和前景改善。在外部方面，香港的商品出口在整年錄得強勁增長，其中一部分支持於全球經濟繼續復甦。服務出口錄得溫和增長，反映活躍的區域貿易和貨物流動，以及更強的跨境業務和金融活動。總進口大幅上升，主要由於更大規模的本地和轉口帶動需求。從淨值來看，外部貿易在2021年對本地生產總值（GDP）增長帶來支持（圖1），因為總出口增長較快於進口。\n\n表 1 本地生產總值按支出構成別計算之成長率（期間對期間）\n\n附註：經季節調整後的固定資本形成季度變動率不可獲得。來源：統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力微升，但全年仍然溫和。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的效應後，經調整的年同比通脹率逐步上升至12月的輕微1.4%（圖2）4。外出用餐、交通、服裝及衣履等消費品價格重拾上升動力，因本地消費需求改善。進口價格亦隨著全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源和大宗商品價格急升而顯著上升。相反，房價拖累整體通脹，反映近期私人住宅新租賃租金下跌的影響（圖2）。大致而言，名義工資及商業租金的緩慢增長有助讓國內企業的成本壓力維持在可控水平。整體而言，2021年的基礎及headline通脹率分別維持在0.6%及1.6%。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價膨脹\n來源：人口普查及統計處。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，勞動市場在2021年有所改善。失業率在2月達到17年高點7.2%後，至12月明顯下跌至4.0%（圖3），且下跌情況廣泛橫跨大多數經濟部門。整體勞動需求逐步轉強，反映於總就業人數（圖3）及私人部門職缺的增加，儘管這些數據仍低於疫情爆發前的高峰。另一方面，勞動力在12月相比一年前略微減少1.3%，部分由於勞動力參與率的溫和下降。名義工資及勞動收入的年同比增長雖然溫和，但在2021年前三個季度顯示出加速跡象，逆轉了2019及2020年的放緩趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況\n資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在今年大致呆滯，儘管一些主要海外股權市場繼續反彈（圖4）。 恆生指數延續年底2020年的反彈，於2021年2月17日上升至31,085點的高位，但自此以來，市場情緒由於多種因素急轉為負面，包括對新COVID-19病毒變種的憂慮、主要中央銀行潛在的貨幣政策收緊，以及互聯互通7下南向交易流入減少。 恆生指數收報23,398點，較一年前顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2021年上半年隨著更好的經濟機遇重拾上升動力，但下半年隨着資產市場氣氛轉弱出現整固（圖4）。整體而言，2021年房屋價格和成交量仍分別錄得3.7%和24.1%的上升。家庭負擔能力亦變得更偏緊，部分反映家庭收入減少。另一方面，在經歷2019年和2020年的顯著調整後，非住宅物業市場一般改善，工業物業的價格和租金一般上升至疫情爆發前的峰值，而零售和辦公室空間則仍然低於其分別的高峰。\n\n見表B：主要經濟指標，第326至327頁，以了解更多詳情，包括其在2017至2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2022年初，本地第五波COVID-19感染造成對本地經濟活動的壓力。因應此，政府推出第五及第六輪的抗疫基金，以及在2022–23預算下的增加反週期措施，以協助支持經濟。香港金融管理局亦與銀行界一同延長了預先批准的本金付款假期計劃至2022年底。\n\n整體而言，2022年的經濟復甦預期將繼續，雖然步伐相比2021年較為溫和，部分反映第五波新冠肺炎疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、較弱的基礎效應以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年實際本地生產總值增長將介於1%至2%的範圍內，而國際組織與私人部門分析員的最新預測平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的強度與步伐受制於眾多不確定性與風險，尤其是在疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑造成的影響。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n隨著進口價格上升及疫情造成的物流中斷，通貨膨脹壓力預期在短期內將輕微上升，但由於租金疲軟及輕微的本地勞動成本壓力，應大致暫停終止權在可控範圍內。市場共識預測2022年的通貨膨脹率為2.4%，而政府預測整體及核心通貨膨脹率分別為2.1%及2.0%。本地COVID-19感染的第五波於2022年初造成了對勞動市場的壓力，尤其是在聯絡密集型行業。進一步而言，勞動市場情況將取決於疫情發展及國內經濟復甦的步伐。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年繼續穩定。總體銀行資產適度擴大，貸款和存款均上升。銀行業的資本和流動性狀況仍然良好。資產質量維持在歷史和國際標準下的健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2021年增長了1.9%。由於經濟復甦，全年總貸款錄得3.8%的增長，相比2020年的1.2%。其中，用於香港的貸款增長了4.4%，用於境外 的貸款增長了1.1%，貿易融資則上升了14.2%。與內地相關的貸款在2021年擴大了3.6%，而在2020年則大致保持穩定。\n\n在負債方面，總存款於2021年上升4.6%，相比2020年的5.4%。由於總存款增長速度較總貸款較快，整體貸款與存款比率微升至2021年底的71.8%，較一年前的72.3%有所下降（圖5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行業的貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業的資本狀況仍然良好。本地註冊的授權機構（AIs）合併總資本比率在2021年底高達20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖6）。兩項比率均遠高於其分別的國際最低要求8%和6%。\n\n巴塞爾ⅲ 的槓桿比率在 2021 年底為 7.9%，良好遠高於法定最低要求 3% （圖 7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性地位良好。第1類機構8在2021年第四季度，流動性覆蓋比率 (LCR) 的季度平均值為151.9%。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的25%（圖8）。\n\n圖8 指定授權機構的流動性比率\n來源：香港金融管理局\n\n銀行業的資料來源仍然穩定。2021年底，第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低要求的100%。核心資金狀況。\n\n第2A類機構的比率（CFR）在2021年底為150.3%，亦高於法定最低要求的75%（圖9）。\n\n圖 9 指定金融機構的資金比率\n來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n資產質素於本年仍然穩定，並維持在符合歷史及國際標準的健康水平。截至2021年底，分類貸款比率為0.88%，相較於2020年底的0.90%，逾期及重組貸款比率則微升至0.56% (圖10)。與中國大陸相關的貸款分類比率於2021年底為0.86%，相較2020年底的0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率分別維持在0.04%及0.20%的低水平

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900

貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管持續的 COVID-19 疫情不確定性及對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮上升，香港港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續以暢順有序的方式進行交易。自1983年實施以來，作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度展現其對外部衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定，定義為香港貨幣與美元在外匯市場的匯率維持在港元7.75–7.85兌1美元的區間內。貨幣體系的結構主要採用貨幣委員會安排，需要貨幣基礎最少支持100%的美元儲備，這些儲備由外匯基金舉辦，且貨幣基礎的變動需與相關的美元儲備變動配合。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n\n債務證書，為三家發行銀行發行的紙幣提供全面支持；政府發行的流通紙幣和硬幣；總餘額，即存放在香港金融管理局（金管局）清算賬戶中的餘額總和；以及香港金融管理局代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund Bills and Notes（EFBNs）。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）對履行可兌換承擔（CUs）的堅決承諾來維持的。香港金融管理局準備就緒，當收到要求時，以每美元7.75（或7.85）的兌換率，向（或從）銀行買入（或賣出）香港美元以換取美元。當強方（或弱方）CU被觸發時，總餘額會擴大（或收縮），以促使香港美元利率下降（或上升），協助促使香港美元回到7.75至7.85的兌換區之內。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n由於與股權相關的需求，以及融資活動和港股通帶來的資金需求，港元年初時成交價接近強方兌換保證區。隨後，隨着股市回調及部分新上市公司回購首次公開發行（IPO）資金，港元一度轉弱，但在第二季度由於企業股息支付需要及港股通淨流入而略有回升。踏入下半年，儘管股市情緒回軟，港元大致維持在強方兌換保證區，並繼續以暢順有序的方式運作（圖1）。整體而言，2021年港元匯兌市場運作正常。\n\n圖1 2021年市場匯率\n\n隨着 CUs 並未觸發，總結餘額及未結清的遠期外匯掉期仍然無大變動，在 2021 年維持在約 15,263 港元（圖 2）。在該年，香港金管局共發行了 80 十億 增加的交換基金票據，以滿足銀行持續對交換基金票據的需求，隨着銀行體系中充裕的流動性，導致總結餘額從 2020 年底的 457.5 十億 收縮至 2021 年底的 377.5 十億。\n\n反映增加發行交換基金票據及按照設立的慣例發行盈餘聯票以吸納盈餘聯票利息支付，本年度未償還的盈餘聯票由港元1,069.2十億上升至港元1,148.8十億。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足地由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 15,263億港元\n\n總餘額及未結清的EFBNs\n\n圖2 總餘額（貼現窗口前）及2021年未償還交換基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在龐大的總結餘支持下，香港銀行同業拆息於全年度大致保持在低水平（圖3）。雖然首個季度因首次公開招股活動增加，對港元的需求上升，但各種期限的香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）波動不大。其後，儘管有對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮，HIBORs仍然大致穩定。至2021年底，HIBORs錄得輕微上升，部分反映預期年底的資金需要。在零售方面，銀行維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗口貸款於2021年下降至港元68億，較2020年的港元91億減少。\n\n圖3 2021年香港美元銀行同業利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）已成為香港金融體系的強大支柱逾三十年，並展現其應對挑戰的韌性。儘管全球經濟復甦造成的持續不確定性，港元匯兌及貨幣市場繼續以有序方式運作，反映聯繫匯率制度的穩健。政府堅決致力於聯繫匯率制度。在2021年外部部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強化的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及謹慎的財政框架已保障了聯繫匯率制度的可信度。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業繼續順利營運，流動性狀況及資本充足率均表現良好，符合國際標準。為確保銀行體系韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管工作。\n\n為優化貨幣委員會帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月以來，已配置特定部分的交換基金資產以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2021年內上落於109.8%至110.5%的範圍，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報110.2%（圖4）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然特定交換基金資產已指定用於支持投資組合，但所有交換基金資產均可獲得以支持港元匯率。交換基金充裕的財務資源，加上健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的支持。\n\n圖4 2021年支持比率的每日走勢\n\n# 貨幣委員會\n\n香港金融管理局外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（CBC）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2021年，CBC探討了包括美國通脹評估、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估縮減恐慌及其對香港的影響，以及了解與內地相關的資金流動對香港貨幣情況的影響。CBC就這些議題的討論錄得，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，已發出至香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n截至2021年底，發鈔銀行發行的在流通紙幣總值為港元5,926億，較一年前上升5.9%（圖5、6和7）。政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中的總值為港元12.9億，按年上升1.7%（圖8和9）。\n\n# 港元5,926十億，+5.9%\n\n紙幣總價值，由發行銀行發行。\n\n# 港元12.9十億，+1.7%\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣的總價值\n\n# 圖

硬幣收數計畫\n\n硬幣收數計劃繼續受到公眾歡迎。有關該計劃的更多資料載於可持續發展章節第198頁。\n\n# 交換基金票據及債券\n\nEFBN 計劃繼續營運順利。為滿足銀行對結餘基金票據的持續需求，隨着銀行體系流動性充裕，香港金融管理局在 2021 年第二半發行了總額為港元 80 十億增加的結餘基金票據。增加發行令相關的總結餘減少。在 2021 年年底，未償結餘基金票據的金額高達港元 1,148.6 十億（表 2）。\n\n表2 交換基金票據及債券未償還金額\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）儘管疫情持續，在2021年仍維持穩定的研究產出。當年，HKIMR發布了30篇工作論文，並舉辦了9場網絡研討會，涵蓋廣泛的主題，包括貨幣政策、銀行穩定性、市場微結構及金融科技（fintech）發展。HKIMR亦舉辦了一場國際會議及一場混合模式的網絡研討會。\n\n題為「人民幣匯率形成機制及匯率展望」的網絡研討會於8月17日與香港金融學院合辦，並在多個網上平台直播，吸引逾1.16百萬即時觀看量。\n\n第11屆年度國際中國經濟會議，題為「邁向共同富裕：雙循環下的中國經濟發展」，於11月11日舉辦。會議討論了與共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷規範、房地產市場、跨境財富管理聯繫及大灣區金融發展相關的最新政策動向。專家演講者亦深入分析了人口老化的影響及社會保障基金的可持續性，以及中國對全球金融穩定與世界經濟的貢獻。會議共設6個不同主題的會場，吸引超過3,200名線上及現場觀眾，總觀看量達5,900次。\n\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2021年仍然穩定，儘管出現了更具傳染性的COVID-19變異株，對全球經濟復甦造成不確定性。當年，香港金融管理局繼續重點放在對持牌金融機構風險管理的監管上。鑑於銀行業面臨持續增加的網絡威脅以及數字化進程加快，亦加強了對持牌金融機構運營及網絡韌性的監管。\n\n在行為監理方面，香港金融管理局向銀行提供指引，以促進使用非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作制定新產品的監理要求，例如與保險掛鈎證券和虛擬資產。銀行業行為準則亦已修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）領域，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的工作重點一直是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中的龍門角色，及其防止及偵測與疫情期間網絡詐騙、中轉帳戶網絡及其他金融罪案相關的非法資金流動的能力。為加強客戶帳戶對詐騙及金融罪案的保護，香港金融管理局深化了與其他持份者透過公私合作夥伴關係的協作及資訊分享。在支持遠程客戶開戶的同時，香港金融管理局亦鼓勵採用包括網絡分析在內的科技，並於11月推出首個AML Regtech實驗室。國際上，主動參與使香港金融管理局在金融行動特別任務組（FATF）的全球AML\/CFT工作中保持領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，廣東－香港－澳門大灣區跨境財富管理聯繫計劃於9月順利推出。本年，香港金融管理局繼續執行其推動香港監管科技應用的兩年路線圖。 若干措施已推出，以奠定銀行機構氣候風險管理的基礎，並大致推動綠色及可持續銀行業務的發展，如在可持續發展章節中所討論。 亦在軟性基礎設施方面作出努力，包括推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業界合作推出能力建設措施，以促進人才發展。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局與銀行業緊密合作，以優化監管政策和流程。在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露等。香港金融管理局繼續推進其工作，以確保授權機構具公信力的決議機制，包括發展新的決議標準及實施吸收損失能力要求的規則，以提升授權機構的可解決性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標當取決於一個高度具韌性的金融體系，提供香港經濟需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營業務的**方式**，可能**影響**系統的穩定性，而在**極端****個案**中，甚至可能以**失序**的**方式****倒閉**。 作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在**確保**銀行**能**抵禦衝擊、並在**危機**中**恢復**其地位，**最終****防止**銀行**倒閉**方面發揮關鍵作用。 貨幣管理局負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責在**香港**授權持牌銀行、限制性牌照銀行及**接受**存款公司，這些機構**稱為**授權機構 (AIs)。\n\n然而，貨幣管理局無法確保，香港的審慎監管框架亦非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣管理局作為解決機構，致力於確保在認可機構出現不可行之時，其倒閉可以有序方式處理。為此，香港已設立金融機構的解決機制，依據該機制，貨幣管理局為認可機構及其他類型機構的解決機構。為落實香港的解決機制，制定解決規則及政策標準、進行解決規劃以消除對認可機構可解決性的障礙，並提升貨幣管理局處理倒閉認可機構的運作能力至關重要。為有效執行這些工作，貨幣管理局採納國際協調一致的方法。\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。在監督FMIs時，香港金融管理局的目標是推動其整體安全與效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。 使FMIs更能抵禦金融危機，可保護香港的貨幣及金融系統免受FMIs中斷所產生 的可行破壞效應。就香港金融管理局的監督方法而言，相關資訊可於香港金融管理局網站上可獲得。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 授權\n\n2021年底，香港有：\n\n年內，香港金融管理局授予三間非本地銀行兩張銀行牌照和一間受限制銀行牌照。香港金融管理局亦授予一間外地交易平台營運商資金經紀批核。年內，三間持牌銀行和兩間受限制牌照銀行的授權均被撤銷。\n\n更多關於人工智能及香港本地代表處的資訊，載於附錄及表 D 至 F，分別在第 321 至 324 頁和第 330 至 333 頁。\n\n# 監督活動簡介\n\n香港金融管理局進行了189項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評級評估1、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技（fintech）策略。作為香港金融管理局繼續推動更強風險管治的其中一部分，已與持牌機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或委員會舉辦了40場會議。此外，香港金融管理局、持牌機構及其外部審計師之間亦舉辦了38場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，香港金融管理局進行了定期現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為風險較高範疇的主題性審查。當年共進行了679項現場檢查及主題性審查，信貸風險管理為重點。隨着銀行越來越廣泛地採用科技，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦為另一主要注意範疇。香港金融管理局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場檢查及主題性審查數目。此外，專門團隊亦進行了針對AIs在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動，以及其反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施的現場檢查及主題性審查。表1載有香港金融管理局2021年的監管活動概要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款在2021年上升3.8%，相比2020年的1.2%增長。表2顯示貸款及推進的分類。\n\n內地相關貸款在2021年上升3.6%，至47,250港元十億（表3）。\n\n銀行業的資產素質在本年大致維持穩定，並根據歷史及國際標準維持在良好水平。截至2021年底，行業的不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來長期運作的歷史平均值1.8%。與內地相關的貸款比率亦下降至0.86%，從一年前的0.96%。\n\n在本年度內，新型冠狀病毒肺炎疫情持續對經濟部分領域造成影響，而中國內地房地產行業的信用事件引起市場注意。香港金融管理局加強了監管的廣度和深度，並對銀行對高度借助借款人的風險敞口進行深入審查。香港金融管理局與銀行維持密切聯繫，以促進對經濟和市場發展影響的最新評估，以及銀行風險管理措施是否足夠的判斷。整體而言，銀行業面對的信貸風險被評估為可控。香港金融管理局最新壓力測試結果確認，銀行業繼續維持足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端壓力。\n\n本年進行專項評估，以評估AIs系統在貸款分類、貸款損失準備、海外貸款業務以及向私人銀行和資產管理客戶提供的抵押貸款方面的控制。\n\n# 紓緩客戶所面臨的資金周轉壓力\n\n9月，香港金融管理局及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制公布將預先批准的本金支付假期計劃延長6個月至2022年4月底。此計劃首個於2020年5月推出，用以延後合資格企業客戶的貸款本金還款6個月。鑑於本地新型冠狀病毒感染反彈，於2022年2月進一步將該計劃延長至2022年10月底。此外，該計劃加強提供1年期部分本金還款選項，供金融上具備能力且願意逐步恢復本金還款的客戶選擇。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准貸款期限延長及其他形式的緩解措施，涉及超過83,000個案，總額逾港元920億。針對個人客戶，銀行已批准超過52,000個案的住宅按揭貸款及其他個人緩解貸款本金寬限期，總額逾港元53億。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局推出的多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已轉強銀行風險管理，以及銀行業對本地房地產市場突然下行的韌性。2021年12月批准的新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數為53%，相比2009年9月首次推出逆周期措施前的64%。2021年12月新按揭貸款的平均債務服務比率仍然低於36%，相比2010年8月首次實施債務服務比率上限時的41%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及技術風險\n\n鑑於銀行對科技的依賴增加，香港金融管理局加強了對運作及科技風險的監管。本年度的主要監管重點包括雲端外包及遠距工作安排的管控。香港金融管理局於12月推出有關「運作韌性」的新監管政策手冊（SPM）模組的諮詢。新SPM模組旨在為銀行提供發展全面且綜合的運作韌性架構的指引。\n\n香港金融管理局於1月推出《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》，以反映最新的網絡安全風險管理良好做法。

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms)

國際金融中心\n\n在2021年，香港金融管理局透過多管齊下的方法，提升了香港作為全球競爭力國際金融中心的地位，並取得了良好進展。\n\n香港金融管理局推出「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融業廣泛採用金融科技，並鞏固香港作為金融科技中心的地位。在快速支付系統方面，其交易額在隨着新冠疫情期間急升。\n\n在增強聯繫方面，本年作出重大進展，此外新增了跨境理財通及債券通下的南向交易，豐富了聯繫計劃的組合。受惠於其世界一流的市場基礎設施及聯繫計劃，香港成為內地資金挖掘全球市場的首選平台，亦是國際投資者進入越來越快速增長的內地市場的重要渠道。\n\n亦於2021年，香港金融管理局致力締造新商業機遇，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，範疇包括債券發行、資產和財富管理、企業財務中心和綠色及可持續金融。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強對海外和內地持份者的市場推廣，使他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所帶來的機遇。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局積極參與國際及區域性的中央銀行和監管論壇，為全球維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展作出貢獻。\n\n# 簡介\n\n香港金融管理局公布了「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列舉措，以推動金融科技（fintech）的廣泛採用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦事處（FFO）與銀行部門一同，在當年推動各種關鍵舉措，包括以下內容：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）的採用\n推出科技基準評估，以了解銀行採用金融科技的情況。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位仍然堅決，離岸人民幣業務在本年登記良好增長。人民幣資產的流入繼續加快步伐，因內地證券納入主要金融市場指數的進程持續。香港在促進國際投資者增加配置人民幣資產方面發揮不可或缺的作用，內地與香港互聯互通計劃被廣泛接受為國際投資者進入內地資本市場的首選渠道。2021年，北向通債券互聯互通的每日成交額上升34%，達到約人民幣258億元。\n\n繼北向債券通成功之後，南向債券通於9月推出，完善了內地與國際債券市場之間的兩向連接。同年同月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）、香港金融管理局（HKMA）及澳門金融管理局公布了粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通（Crossboundary WMC）方案的實施細則。10月，香港合資格銀行開始與內地合作銀行一同提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為主要離岸人民幣中心的地位，一個包括香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及香港交易所（HKEX）的工作小組已成立，以進行有關推動在香港交易以人民幣計值的股本證券的可行性研究。中國人民銀行與香港金融管理局亦於12月合辦了一場研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領導人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續作出進展，加強香港金融平台的競爭力。特別是，為上升香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業緊密合作，提供更有利於基金設立的稅務和監管環境。亦在進一步提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心和債券發行中心的地位方面作出重大進展。同時，香港金融管理局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推動香港的金融服務。\n\n安全且高效的金融基礎設施運作，對於鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心地位至關重要。2021年，四個銀行間實時總額結算（RTGS）系統、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易存管處達到100%系統可用性，表現優於99.95%的目標。以下，隨著9月推出南向債券通，CMU變得為北向通及南向債券通下進行交易的結算及保管服務提供商。\n\nFPS 的使用繼續擴大。2021 年底，登記數目增至 960 百萬，全年每日平均交易額較 2020 年上升九成。使用 FPS 結清政府帳戶、進行商戶付款以及增值電子錢包或銀行帳戶，是推動交易量持續上升的主要推動力，加上個人對個人及商業付款的穩定增長。\n\n為推動本地零售支付業的安全及效率，香港金融管理局負責監察6個指定的零售支付系統 (RPSs) ，並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》(PSSVFO) 監察15間持牌儲值支付工具機構。 於本年度，香港金融管理局透過協調及推動相關政府部門與為此計劃委任的儲值支付工具持牌機構之間的對話及合作，促進政府消費券計劃的暢順運作。\n\n2022年1月，香港金融管理局發佈了一份關於加密資產和穩定幣的討論，闡述了香港金融管理局對相關監管方法的思考，並邀請持份者提供意見。相關因素，包括對此討論的回饋以及相關國際機構的建議，將會被納入考慮，以制定合適的監管制度。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。例如，香港金融管理局主持東亞太平洋中央銀行高級管理層會議（EMEAP）2下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）。香港金融管理局亦聯席主席巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（Basel Committee）的政策與標準小組、非銀行監測專家小組，以及金融穩定委員會（FSB）的金融創新網絡，並促使一個團隊研究與金融基準轉型相關的監管問題。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 金融科技 2025\n\n6月，香港金融管理局公布其「金融科技2025」策略，以帶動香港金融科技發展。該策略目標是鼓勵金融業於2025年前全面應用科技，並推動提供公平且高效金融服務，以造福香港市民及經濟。該策略的五個重點範疇為：\n\n所有銀行進行金融科技\n加深研究香港以適應央行數字貨幣\n締造下一步數據基礎設施\n擴展具金融科技知識的勞動力\n以資金和政策培育生態系統\n\n香港金融管理局的「金融科技2025」策略推動香港金融科技發展。\n\n# 銀行業的金融科技應用\n\n為支持「金融科技2025」策略中「所有銀行進行金融科技」的倡議，香港金融管理局於2021年6月推出了科技基準評估。該評估協助香港金融管理局更好了解銀行業當前金融科技的範疇，並識別哪些金融科技範疇可能需要香港金融管理局的協助。所有在香港有重要業務的持牌銀行均被要求於2021年底前制訂為期三年的金融科技採用計劃。\n\n本年度，香港金融管理局亦繼續實施其兩年期路線圖，以推動香港銀行採用合規科技，並在其自身的監管過程中融入科技，以優化效率及成效。詳情請見「銀行穩定」章節第98頁。\n\n# 批發央行數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局與泰國央行於2021年2月擴大聯合研究計劃的範圍，阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所隨後加入。該項目重新命名為「多央行數字貨幣橋（mBridge）」，並獲得香港國際清算銀行（BIS）創新中心的大力支持，進一步探索分布式分類帳技術促進即時跨境外匯支付對支付（PvP）交易的能力，適用於多司法管轄區環境和24\/7全天候運營。一份聯合報告於9月發出，以提供中期結果，隨後於11月發布潛力使用情境與未來路線圖。\n\n# 零售央行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）準備方面的未來，香港金融管理局開始研究在香港發行零售CBDC的前景，即電子港元（e-HKD），涵蓋技術和政策考量。香港金融管理局與香港BIS創新中心合作，踏上名為Project Aurum的研究，以探討發行零售CBDC的技術面向。此外，建立了一個跨部門內部工作小組，以研究相關的技術、政策和法律條款。10月，香港金融管理局發布了一份題為《e-HKD：技術觀點》的技術白皮書，旨在探討並邀請對發行及分銷零售CBDC的潛力技術設計選項提出意見。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局支持中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所進行數字人民幣跨境支付的技術試點。這將協助推動粵港澳大灣區的互聯互通，並透過增強跨境支付的效率和用戶經驗，為香港及內地旅客帶來更大便利。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n7月，香港金融管理局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行及 SVF 營運商參與 CDI，這是一項旨在促進銀行系統內更高效金融中介的下一代金融數據基礎設施。為進一步促進發展和採用，金管局於研討會期間公布將推出 CDI 創新中心。為促進中小企業（細中型企業）融資，金管局已完成兩階段的概念驗證研究，以檢視 CDI 的技術可行性。透過應用替代數據以協助信貸評估及貸款承保，參與銀行在研究期間已批准超過 550 筆中小企業貸款，總額超過 900 百萬港元。以鼓勵的結果為基礎，金管局於 11 月公布 CDI 的試點推出。\n\n中小企業主讚揚CDI簡化他們的貸款申請。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange

儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑。儘管全球經濟繼續受影響於反覆演變的COVID-19疫情，但多項因素，包括增加的疫苗接種率，以及全球各地的寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施，帶來支持了全球經濟和金融市場的復甦。在此背景下，數目海外股票市場達致歷史新高，而外匯基金的整體股票持有量，儘管香港股票表現呆滯，仍能爭取不俗的回報。在2021年，外匯基金錄得港元1,919十億的投資收入，相當於4.1%的投資回報。\n\n# 兌換基金\n\n香港外匯基金的首要目標，如《外匯基金條例》所訂明，是影響香港貨幣的匯價，無論直接或間接皆可。該基金亦可能被運用以維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和完整性，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心。香港金融管理局在財政司司長轉授的權力下，並在轉授條款的範圍內，須對財政司司長負責外匯基金的使用和投資管理。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金顧問委員會（EFAC）已建立以下投資目標：\n\n（i）保障資本；\n（ii）確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均由高度流通性的美元資產十足支持；\n（iii）確保有足夠的流通性可獲得，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；\n（iv）受制於（i）至（iii），爭取投資回報以協助保障交換基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標推行全面考慮了交易所基金的法定目的，並已註冊於基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中（圖示1）。\n\n圖示 1 外匯基金投資組合區分\n\n大致來說，外匯基金擁有兩主要投資組合：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流通性高的美元資產，以提供全面支持給貨幣基礎，這是在貨幣委員會安排下所需。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作暨發展機構成員經濟體的債券和股權市場，以保障其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局以謹慎及漸進的步伐，分散外匯基金部分投資至更廣大的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票在IP下持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則在長期增長組合（LTGP）下持有。自LTGP成立以來，香港金融管理局已訂下上限1，以指引分散投資至LTGP的方式。隨著LTGP在投資規模及資產多樣性方面日趨成熟，外匯基金諮詢委員會於2022年1月決定以目標資產配置代替上限，該目標資產配置與其他資產類別同時制定，並受穩健風險管理原則所規範。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年設立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，這些股份由政府為基金的戰略目的而購入。由於其獨特的性質，戰略投資組合未被包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 存款與發行基金\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。利率一般連結IP2的表現，主要例外是未來基金3，其利率根據IP和LTGP的回報，根據投資組合配置而定。未來基金在2021年IP與LTGP之間的投資組合配置約為40：60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n交易所基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置決策為支撐：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑑於交易所基金的投資目標而制定的長期資產配置。指引下，資產會以戰術方式配置，以爭取超越基準的超額回報。這方式意味著實際配置往往不同於基準（或策略性）配置。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準和循跡誤差限制由財政司長諮詢金融管理局諮詢委員會後制定，但戰術決策和容許的戰術偏離範圍則由香港金融管理局在轉授權力下作出並建立。對內而言，在容許的戰術偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可能採取倉位以推行短期市場變動的獲利機會（圖示 2）。\n\n圖示 2 交易所基金的資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的外匯基金投資辦公室管理其投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的職員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括全部的BP及IP的一部分。這部分IP包括一組投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及各種用於實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理人員\n\n此外，除了內部管理資產，香港金融管理局僱用外部基金經理管理約29%的交換基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他特別資產類別。參與外部經理的目的是挖掘市場上可獲得的最佳投資專業知識，以獲取可持續的回報，汲取多元且互補的投資方式，並獲得市場見解和技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部經理有關的支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易費用，以及扣繳及其他稅費。此支出主要由市場因素決定，每年可能不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的複雜性越來越增加，突顯了風險管理的重要性。香港金融管理局為內部及外部管理的投資組合組嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並確保有嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。為有效實施風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已設立三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸風險、市場風險、流動性風險及操作風險）會定期監察，而風險管理程序則提供良好框架，以支持戰略規劃及投資多元化。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局認為，透過對負責任投資及可持續長期經濟表現的適當重視，更好爭取外匯基金的投資目標，並減低其基礎投資與環境、社會及治理（ESG）相關事宜所帶來的風險。香港金融管理局支持負責任投資，方法是將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公眾及私人市場投資流程，其指導原則是，若長期風險調整後的回報與其他投資相若，則一般會將工作重點放在ESG投資。如欲了解更多有關香港金融管理局負責任投資架構及實施細節，請見第184頁至191頁的可持續發展章節。\n\n# 外匯基金績效\n\n# 2021年金融市場\n\n全球股市急升並衝擊新高，在極為寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施的推動下，加速了全球經濟和金融市場的復甦。然而，隨着市場改革，香港及內地股市表現遜色。美國標準普爾500指數上升了27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌了14%。\n\n對於債券市場而言，上升的通貨膨脹預期以及美國聯準會（Fed）縮減資產購置，導致2021年美國國債收益率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率從年初的0.9%上升至年底的1.5%，上升了60個基點。\n\n在外匯市場上，美元對其他主要貨幣轉強，尤其在2021年底，在聯邦儲備委員會縮減步伐的影響下。特別是，歐元和日圓分別對美元貶值7.1%和10.3%。\n\n2021年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表一所示。\n\n# 交換基金的表現\n\n香港基金於2021年錄得投資收益1,919億港元。這包括債券收益126億港元，權益淨收益478億港元（其中海外權益收益688億港元，香港權益虧損21億港元），非港元資產的正貨幣換算效應168億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益1,147億港元。此外，策略投資組合錄得估值收益31億港元。\n\n於年底，交易所基金的總資產達到45,702億港元。長期投資策略（LTGP）的投資市值總值為5,153億港元，其中私募股權總值為3,925億港元，房地產總值為1,228億港元。LTGP的未償投資承諾總值為2,257億港元。\n\n2021年交易所基金的投資回報，不包括戰略組合，為4.1%。具體而言，IP達致3.7%的回報率，而BP錄得0.4%。LTGP自2009年以來，已錄得15.4%的年化內部收益率。\n\n自1994年至2021年，交易所基金的年度回報載於圖1。表2顯示2021年的投資回報以及基金在若干不同時段內的平均投資回報。2019年至2021年的平均回報為5.3%，2017年至2021年的平均回報為4.7%，2012至2021年的平均回報為3.3%，自1994年以來為4.8%。表3顯示基金於2021年12月31日的貨幣組合。\n\n請參閱第211至319頁的香港交換基金2021年度經審核財務報表。\n"}

Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"developing":["發展"],"function":["職能"],"particular":["特別"],"9.6":["960"],"strong":["強"],"27":["27"],"highly":["高度"],"students":["學生"],"seize":["把握"],"use":["使用"],"co-ordinates":["統籌"],"safeguard":["保障"],"second":["第二"],"launch":["推出"],"’":[""],"maintain":["維持"],"relate":["有關"],"dedicated":["致力於"],"face":["面對"],"talk":["介紹"],"enhance":["提升"],"lingering":["持續的"],"recommendations":["建議"],"built":["建立"],"42":["42"],"maintaining":["維持"],"areas":["範疇"],"flexible":["靈活"],"serving":["服務"],"comprises":["包括"],"grow":["增長"],"began":["開始"],"sharp":["顯著"],"turn":["轉變"],"allowing":["讓"],"2017":["2017"],"participating":["參與"],"well":["良好"],"strengthening":["加強"],"aspects":["方面"],"outbreak":["爆發"],"adhere":["恪守"],"knowledge":["知識"],"based":["以⋯⋯為基礎"],"billion":["十億"],"track":["軌道"],"end":["年底"],"rougher":["崎嶇"],"get":["變得"],"lent":["提供"],"substantial":["大量"],"payment-related":["用作支付用途的"],"Looking":["展望"],"191.9":["1,919"],"December":["12月"],"mean":["意思是"],"mobilising":["引導"],"base":["基礎"],"brought":["帶來"],"need":["需要"],"Subsequently":["其後"],"Finally":["最後"],"seeking":["尋求"],"rollout":["推出"],"governments":["政府"],"mainly":["主要"],"double-digit":["雙位數"],"reduction":["減少"],"continue":["繼續"],"cement":["鞏固"],"entered":["踏入"],"demonstrated":["顯示"],"volatile":["波動"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"providing":["提供"],"benefitting":["受惠"],"also":["亦"],"capture":["把握"],"premature":["過早"],"adding":["加上"],"tough":["艱難"],"committed":["致力"],"faring":["表現"],"aspires":["旨在"],"status":["地位"],"managing":["管理"],"parts":["部分"],"better":["更好"],"first":["首個"],"recovery":["復甦"],"equivalent":["等值"],"namely":["即"],"deteriorated":["惡化"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"4.1":["4.1"],"invite":["邀請"],"Despite":["儘管"],"severe":["嚴重"],"discussion":["討論"],"must":["必須"],"relevant":["相關"],"Meanwhile":["另一方面"],"successful":["成功"],"goes":["有云"],"marks":["標誌"],"increased":["上升"],"see":["見到"],"2050":["2050"],"solid":["穩健"],"past":["過去"],"together":["一同"],"real-time":["即時"],"formulated":["制定"],"pleased":["高興"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"Although":["儘管"],"90":["九成"],"effectively":["有效"],"maintained":["維持"],"ready":["準備就緒"],"vibrancy":["活力"],"years":["年"],"contraction":["收縮"],"point":["指出"],"may":["可能"],"changed":["改變"],"intensification":["升溫"],"prudently":["審慎"],"RMB26":["260億元人民幣"],"traded":["成交"],"increase":["上升"],"tap":["挖掘"],"two":["兩"],"year":["年"],"introduced":["推出"],"recover":["恢復"],"aligning":["呼應"],"groom":["培育"],"151.9":["151.9"],"journey":["旅程"],"future":["未來"],"adopting":["採納"],"set":["建立"],"continued":["繼續"],"increasingly":["日益"],"practical":["實用"],"go":["進行"],"pace":["步伐"],"launched":["推出"],"activity":["活動"],"emergence":["出現"],"extended":["延長"],"published":["發出"],"months":["個月"],"dominant":["主導"],"meeting":["滿足"],"established":["設立"],"throughout":["全"],"enhancing":["增強"],"Tackling":["處理"],"tCO2e\/US":["tCO2e"],"formulate":["制定"],"watch":["留意"],"series":["連串"],"strengthen":["加強"],"achieved":["達致"],"grew":["增長"],"promote":["推動"],"always":["一如既往"],"establishment":["設立"],"hard-pressed":["經營環境艱難"],"pressure":["壓力"],"five":["五"],"require":["需要"],"manage":["管理"],"87":["87%"],"enter":["進入"],"recorded":["錄得"],"revised":["修訂"],"power":["力量"],"cover":["涵蓋"],"trials":["測試"],"facilitate":["促進"],"closely":["緊密"],"concurrent":["同時"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"share":["分享"],"time":["時"],"tackle":["應對"],"guidance":["指引"],"degree":["程度"],"colleagues":["同事"],"reaching":["達到"],"quote":["舉例"],"diversifying":["多元化"],"50":["50"],"across":["橫跨"],"number":["數目"],"15.4":["15.4"],"covering":["涵蓋"],"cash-flow":["資金周轉"],"path":["路徑"],"resources":["資源"],"invest":["投資"],"organisation":["機構"],"outside":["境外"],"leveraging":["利用"],"twice":["兩度"],"six":["6"],"Besides":["此外"],"million":["百萬"],"numerous":["無數"],"completing":["完善"],"timely":["及時"],"capitalise":["把握"],"reaffirming":["重申"],"supporting":["支持"],"taking":["採取"],"feedback":["回饋"],"latter":["後者"],"ever":["曾"],"appropriate":["合適"],"fourfold":["四倍"],"facing":["面對"],"ultimately":["最終"],"comprehensively":["全面"],"kinds":["類"],"us":["我們"],"overnight":["一朝一夕"],"reflecting":["反映"],"reached":["達到"],"principle":["原則"],"testament":["見證"],"essentially":["本質上"],"including":["包括"],"developmental":["發展的"],"develop":["制訂"],"joined":["攜手"],"achievements":["成果"],"room":["空間"],"levels":["層面"],"help":["協助"],"vision":["願景"],"robustness":["穩健"],"recognising":["鑑於"],"quarter":["季度"],"proactive":["主動"],"city":["城市"],"helping":["幫助"],"assured":["保障"],"cycle":["循環"],"1983":["1983"],"128":["128"],"arising":["產生"],"adopt":["應用"],"huge":["巨大"],"milestone":["里程碑"],"worse":["惡化"],"prospect":["前景"],"spectrum":["範疇"],"disclose":["披露"],"grown":["發展"],"resurgence":["反彈"],"purchasing":["購買力"],"virtuous":["生生不息"],"footing":["基礎"],"start":["開始"],"still":["仍"],"connect":["聯繫"],"offers":["提供"],"ensure":["確保"],"fact":["事實"],"conviction":["信心"],"forefront":["領先"],"leveraged":["借助"],"attract":["吸引"],"jurisdiction":["地區"],"Enhancing":["提升"],"position":["地位"],"rise":["上升"],"totalling":["總額達"],"underpinned":["支撐"],"crucial":["至關重要"],"jointly":["聯同"],"generated

媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。2021年，香港金融管理局舉辦或參與了169項實體及虛擬活動，包括八場記者會、八次即時訪問及153項其他公眾活動。另外安排了27次媒體訪問。全年共發佈了632份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升香港金融管理局的關鍵職能意識，為本地、內地及外國媒體舉辦新聞發佈會和媒體簡報會。主題包括聯繫計劃、金融科技（fintech）及利率基準改革。\n\n為及時與公眾保持聯繫，香港金融管理局保持五個社交媒體渠道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter

名追蹤者。香港金融管理局利用其社交媒體渠道，提升公眾對廣泛主題的意識，特別是網絡釣魚詐騙，此類詐騙在疫情期間顯著上升。此外，透過社交媒體進行了廣泛的推廣活動，主題包括綠色金融、金融科技及聯繫計劃，以讓公眾掌握最新發展趨勢。\n\n葉偉文先生，香港金融管理局行政總裁，主持2021年香港金融科技週的虛擬討論。\n\n李達志先生，香港金融管理局副行政總裁，主辦有關「金融科技2025」策略的媒體簡報會。\n\n阮國恒先生，香港金融管理局副總裁，主辦向媒體舉行的香港銀行業為倫敦銀行同業拆息過渡所做的準備簡報會。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁劉Edmond先生與國際新聞頻道進行訪問。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務提供一種有效方式，讓公眾更好了解香港金融管理局的主要職能及運作。2021年，該服務處理了9,781宗查詢。其中一半的查詢與銀行政策及法規、消費者銀行業務、紙幣及硬幣，以及金融基礎設施和債券市場發展相關。一些重要的查詢涉及硬幣收數計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖1顯示自2018年起收到的公眾查詢數目，圖2則提供2021年按查詢性質分類。\n\n圖 1 公眾查詢總數目\n\n圖 2：2021 年收到的查詢性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了香港金融管理局年報外，香港金融管理局發出兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告，及四期季度匯報，並定期更新月度統計通訊，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。香港金融管理局亦發出十一篇 inSight1 文章，以引入其主要新措施和政策，並探討感興趣的議題。\n\n香港金融管理局二零二零年年報在香港管理專業人員協會二零二一年最佳年報獎中，於「非營利及慈善機構」類別獲得銀獎，並在環境、社會及管治報告方面獲得卓越獎。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n香港金融管理局的網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）載有超過 44,000 頁的內容，包括英文和傳統中文，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的主要入口。它包含根據《銀行條例》第 20 部分維持的經授權金融機構和當地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及經授權金融機構證券人員的登記冊，還包含根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維持的儲值設施持牌人的登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）自2018年以來，已透過開放應用程式介面（API）分階段在其網站上發布財務數據及重要資訊。截至2021年底，金管局已在其網站上開展了148組開放API，符合專項計劃。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心設於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向社會各界介紹香港金融管理局工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的意識的重要設施。它分為一個展覽區和一個圖書館。展覽區以互動方式簡介香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展。它亦載有關於香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務的研究資料和展品。圖書館設於展覽區的下一步，藏有超過26,000本關於香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務以及中央銀行主題的書籍、期刊和其他出版物。它亦保持人工智能及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及人工智能證券人員的登記冊，以供公眾查閱，符合銀行條例第20部分的要求。\n\n為保障公眾健康及安全，於新冠疫情期間，資訊中心訂下特殊運作安排。清潔及消毒工作加強，並定期以抗菌塗層對設施及展品進行衛生處理。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的展覽區包括政策部分、貨幣部分及歷史時間軸。\n\n# 社區參與與公眾教育\n\n為接觸社區並提升公眾對香港金融管理局工作的意識，該局自1998年以來一直舉辦公眾教育計劃。2021年，為來自84間中學的逾2,300名學生及教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。該研討會涵蓋香港金融管理局的工作簡介、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數碼鑰匙的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的事業機會。至今，已有超過63,000人參與該公眾教育計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局致力教育及聯繫公眾，讓大家成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙案件上升，香港金融管理局進行了一項主題為「保障您的個人數字密碼；小心欺詐連結！」的公眾意識活動，透過各媒體宣傳，呼籲公眾保持警惕，以防來自銀行發送的手機短訊和訊息中的欺詐連結。\n\n跨媒體推廣提醒公眾謹慎防範詐欺超連結。\n\n香港金融管理局亦旨在提升公眾對金融業的認識，並提升年輕一代投身該行業事業的興趣。繼2020年網上劇集《STEPS》獲得正面的回饋後，香港金融管理局推出一連串新系列，題為《中環人才多面貌》，內容橫跨數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理四個越來越重要的範疇。在該系列影片中，市場從業人員的人物形象以幽默方式描劃，經驗豐富的業界人士與年輕人才亦分享有關上述四個範疇內工作性質及要求、事業機遇及發展方面的首方面資料。\n\n中央人才四面觀系列讓年輕一代掌握金融市場的事業機會。\n\n「線上親子教育活動」於2020年推出，並在MarketingInteractive舉辦的2021年Marketing Events Awards「最佳活動 — 企業社會責任」類別中獲得銀獎。為延續活動的成功及保持發展勢頭，香港金融管理局推出增加的措施，包括親子財務教育工作坊，兒童教育專家在工作坊中分享如何教導孩子良好的理財意義，並顯示一款DIY（自製）財務教育玩具，以及香港金融管理局資訊中心的動畫虛擬導覽。\n\n「線上親子教育活動」榮獲行銷活動獎2021。該活動推動理財概念和技巧，讓父母與孩子以輕鬆有趣的方式學習。\n\n為提升中學學生的金融理財知識，香港金融管理局與各種持份者合辦「香港金融理財知識錦標賽」，主題為金融科技。除了網上測驗外，更增設一個新 的個人財務管理金融設計思維工作坊，以培訓參與學生制訂創新理財工具的方案。此項計劃榮獲教育局「商校合作計劃」頒發「最高學生參與獎」，並獲投資者及金融教育委員會（IFEC）頒發「投資者及金融教育獎（機構組）— 金獎」。\n\n「香港金融理財知識錦標賽」向學生普及金融科技和設計思維概念，並創下參與人數創新高。\n\n其他社區參與計劃包括為學生及退休人士舉辦的講座或網上研討會。香港金融管理局亦參與了由教育局舉辦的有關經濟安全的教師培訓網上研討會。提供有關用以使用自動櫃員機的精明提示的網上教育資料，以八種語言可獲得，以照顧在香港居住的不同背景人士。\n\n香港金融管理局支持香港國際金融教育中心推動金融理財知識及能力，並將探討與持份者進一步合作，以最大限度地提升社區參與的影響。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高透明度，香港金融管理局採納適用於中央銀行營運的國際財務披露標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特殊數據發布標準。財務部門與外部審計師及其他專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告準則準備及呈現交換基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦在其年度報告中提供詳細披露及廣泛範圍的開支項目和預算信息之深入分析。\n\n# 問責性與控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要的工作之一是管理貨幣和銀行系統的風險。風險管理既在日常運作中推行，也在高層次策略規劃中推行。在香港金融管理局的風險管理框架下，設有兩項委員會—宏觀監控委員會及風險委員會—兩者均由香港金融管理局行政總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監視委員會的條款為：\n\n識別香港貨幣及金融體系潛在的風險和威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可行措施；檢討現有管理貨幣及金融體系風險的措施，以識別可能的缺口，並確保這些措施的充足性；鼓勵跨部門分享相關的宏觀監測資訊，鑑於增強香港金融管理局的宏觀監測能力。\n\n風險委員會的條款，界定其職責範圍如下：\n\n- 識別機構潛在的風險與威脅，並制定策略以減低這些活動的影響；\n- 檢討現有橫跨不同部門的風險管理系統，以識別可能的缺口與重大風險，並確保應對這些風險的措施充分；\n- 協調風險衡量的標準與方法，並優先管理已識別的資源；\n- 推動機構內更強的風險管理文化，促進嚴謹的授權與控制層面。\n\n良好的營運風險管理框架已推行，涵蓋機構在兩層面的風險：實體層面和部門層面。實體層面的風險主要指那些在中長期會影響整個機構，或可能通知跨部門因應的風險。業務單位識別出的潛力及新興風險，以及他們制定的控制措施和緩解策略的適當性，會每季度進行審查並報告。此外，還採用由上而下的方法來管理實體層面的風險，由高層同事領導不同業務單位積極識別對廣大範圍有影響的風險，並提出緩解措施。風險委員會會討論這些評估結果，並決定合適的跟進行動。\n"}
{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot

永續性\n\n香港金融管理局現正發佈其首個可持續發展報告，作為其2021年年報之中文部分，以建立其可持續發展策略，並記錄其自身努力，以及與金融業界共同努力，以支持政府氣候策略，並貢獻於一個更具氣候韌性及可持續發展的世界。\n\n香港金融管理局將可持續性考慮融入其主要角色和功能之中，無論其作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，或在維持金融及貨幣穩定方面。此外，香港金融管理局亦與本地及海外機構合作，加強氣候風險的管理及披露，以及發展綠色及可持續金融市場。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，目標是成為一個負責任且可持續的機構。此承諾體現在各種範疇，包括推動可持續、金融普及且環境友善的市場，支持廣大社群，保護環境以及營造關愛的工作空間。\n\n# 簡介\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最大挑戰之一。為了應對氣候變化，各國在《巴黎協定》下同意推行行動以減少溫室氣體排放，並最終在本世紀內爭取實現碳中和。滿足《巴黎協定》的氣候變化目標需要全球每年估計投入一到二萬億美元，使可持續性成為未來數十年資本流動的最大推動力。\n\n香港致力成為此過渡的領先者。政府公布將爭取在2050年前實現碳中和，呼應全球發達經濟體的方針。香港亦為首個亞洲地區，致力於於2025年前具體呼應氣候相關財務披露任務組（TCFD）建議的披露要求，橫跨相關行業。\n\n對金融業而言，氣候變遷既是風險來源，也是機會。雖然金融業無法置身於氣候變遷所帶來的威脅之外，但它在轉型過程中扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金導向與降低溫室氣體排放及氣候韌性發展接近的活動。\n\n香港金融管理局致力加強香港的金融體系，以支持更綠色和可持續的未來，推動行動支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。為此，香港金融管理局在履行其主要職能及日常運作中，納入可持續發展的考慮因素。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局的目標是加強銀行體系對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行支持向低碳經濟過渡的進程。為此，香港金融管理局已制定監管框架，明確銀行管理及披露氣候風險的監管要求。金管局亦於2021年順利完成氣候風險壓力測試試驗，以評估銀行業的韌性。另一方面，金管局持續納入氣候變化因素以監測金融穩定風險。\n\n第二，香港金融管理局在其市場發展角色中，聚焦於增強香港作為區域內綠色及可持續金融中心的地位，包括大灣區。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，具備良好條件，可引導全球投資進入內地，以實現2030年碳排放達峰及2060年碳中和的目標。香港金融管理局亦透過由其聯席主席的綠色及可持續金融督導小組，提升業界能力、應對數據缺口，並探討本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港是綠色金融解決方案的領先者，已設立全球首個政府全球中期票據計劃，致力於政府綠色債券計劃項下的綠色債券發行，並自2019年以來逐步擴大其發行的貨幣和期限的多樣性。為支持私營部門發行綠色及可持續債券和貸款，政府於2021年5月建立綠色及可持續金融資助計劃。由香港金管局管理，此計劃已鼓勵更多企業尋求香港的綠色及可持續融資，並促使更多綠色顧問及外部審核員在此設立或擴大業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金的經理，香港金融管理局已確保環境、社會及管治（ESG）考慮是其投資流程和資產配置決策不可或缺的組成部分。在本報告的後者部分，香港金融管理局作出首份有關外匯基金投資組合的氣候情景分析和碳足跡指標的披露。\n\n第四，香港金融管理局正積極提升自身的綠色辦公室措施，以確保其營運符合管理及緩解氣候風險的最佳實踐。作為開始，香港金融管理局已設立橫跨第一級及第二級排放的碳排放概況，並作出相關披露。同時，香港金融管理局已實施措施以提升業界整體運作效率並減少資源消耗。此外，香港金融管理局以高標準要求自身履行企業社會責任（CSR），並與持份者合作，推動金融包容及金融理財知識。\n\n綠化金融體系需要中央銀行和監管機構之間的接近合作。香港金融管理局是國際社會在全球政策制定和可持續發展標準協調方面積極的成員。香港金融管理局亦發布聲明，支持中央銀行和監管機構綠化金融體系網絡（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言5，重申其承諾落實 NGFS 建議，並採取必要措施促進更綠色的金融體系。\n\n推動這些可持續發展倡議，並評估氣候相關的機會與風險時，可持續發展和綠色考量已融入香港金融管理局的治理及風險管理框架中，領導層積極參與設定整體目標及原則，並與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其下屬委員會進行諮詢。香港金融管理局的機構社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦評估可持續發展及氣候相關問題對機構的潛力影響，並制定策略以減低這些影響。相關策略及倡議的執行情況會緊密監察，並定期向高層管理層報告。此外，已聘請外部顧問就選定的範疇向香港金融管理局提供意見。\n\n本章後續章節將深入探討香港金融管理局在各個角色中進行綠色金融和可持續發展工作的管治、策略和風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參考金融穩定論壇（NGFS）於12月2021年發出之《氣候相關披露指引》中建議的披露要素編製而成。此外，香港金融管理局辦公室營運的相關資訊，作出廣泛參考全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準以及香港交易所有限公司頒布的ESG報告指引。\n\n# 中央銀行與監管機構綠色金融體系網絡\n\nNGFS 提供一個平台，讓中央銀行與審慎監管機構交流經驗、分享最佳實踐，貢獻於金融部門環境與氣候風險管理的發展，並調動主流金融資源支持邁向可持續經濟的轉型。其宗旨是界定並推動最佳實踐，對內及境外實施，並進行或委託有關綠色金融的分析工作。\n\n# 氣候相關財務披露工作小組\n\n2015年12月，金融穩定委員會制訂了TCFD，以制訂建議，協助企業就氣候相關資訊向投資者、貸款人及保險承保人提供更有效的披露，能推動更認識的決策。TCFD的建議以四個主題範疇為基礎，這些範疇代表了組織營運的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理以及指標與目標。\n\n# 銀行業監督官\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應主動管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資金引導至綠色和可持續活動。作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（HKMA）專注於提升銀行對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行支持向低碳經濟過渡的進程。\n\n# 香港金融管理局的三階段方法簡介\n\n自2019年5月以來，香港金融管理局已分三個階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n建立一個共同的框架以評估各銀行的「綠色基準」，並與國際機構合作，為香港銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 階段（ii）\n\n諮詢業界及其他持份者有關綠色及可持續銀行業的監管預期及要求。\n\n# 階段（iii）\n\n聚焦於落實監管要求，監測與評估銀行在綠色與永續金融方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n2020年，香港金融管理局與業界合作，發展了一套常見的框架，以評估個別銀行的「綠色基準」。香港金融管理局亦進行了首個銀行綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行準備新監管要求，一份白皮書於6月2020年發出，闡釋了香港金融管理局對氣候風險管理的初步監管期望。\n\n於2021年12月，以下產業諮詢，香港金融管理局發佈了銀行將氣候因素納入治理、策略、風險管理和披露的監管要求。特別是，根據TCFD的建議，強制銀行在2025年之前進行與氣候相關的披露，並建立具體時間表。這些要求將建立基準，協助銀行提升風險管理能力。\n\n下一步是香港金融管理局監察銀行落實相關要求的情況。為此，香港金融管理局已加強其監管能力，於其銀行監管部門內成立一個新的專責團隊，以執行氣候風險監管工作。\n\n此三階段方法為一反覆且持續演進的過程。繼2020年進行的首輪綠色評估後，香港金融管理局正檢視框架，以涵蓋新的氣候風險管理監管要求，並有可能涵蓋廣大範疇，例如其他環境風險及支持淨零轉型的措施。香港金融管理局有意於2022年第二半推出更新後的框架。\n\n# 支持轉向碳中和的健全做法。\n\n除了將氣候風險考量融入風險管理架構外，部分銀行已致力投入資源並採取措施，以支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並貢獻於爭取全球淨零排放。香港金融管理局於2021年12月發出通告，與業界分享這些銀行的良好實踐，這些實踐對業界其他銀行制定氣候策略具有參考價值。這些良好實踐歸納為四個範疇：減少銀行運作的溫室氣體排放、透過投資組合對齊減少融資排放、協助客戶轉型，以及推動集體努力協助經濟實現淨零排放轉變。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融流動\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的一致制定，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正與其他金融監管機構合作，探討建立本地綠色分類框架，以促進在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）8所開發的常見基礎分類法（CGT）與中國及歐盟所採用的綠色定義之間協調，並在不同金融領域內採用。此項工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性原則為指引，並採取其他綠色定義、過渡活動及本地因素等考量。此項倡議將減低綠色漂綠的風險，優化產品的可比性，並最終提升投資者保護。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化所帶來潛在衝擊的能力，香港金融管理局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試驗，包括20間主要零售銀行及7間國際銀行集團分行的參與。總結試驗結果的報告於2021年12月發出。結果顯示，儘管面對極端氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍然具備韌性，這些衝擊有可能對銀行財務狀況產生重大負面影響。該試驗有助提升銀行測量及評估氣候風險的能力。鑑於CRST結果，參與銀行已制定計劃以加強其氣候策略及風險治理架構。香港金融管理局會繼續與業界保持聯繫，以加強銀行的能力並提升CRST框架，並採取從試驗中所學到的經驗教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

交易所基金\n\n審計署署長報告 交換基金財務報表\n\n# 審計委員會 香港特殊行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審計了交換基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）載於第217至319頁的財務報表，包括交換基金及集團截至2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及其收入及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n根據我的意見，財務報表提供截至2021年12月31日止，基金及集團的財務地位的真實及公平鑑於，並已根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）妥為編製，且已根據行政長官根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7部分作出之指令妥為編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所作的指示，以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我在報告中「財務報表審計」部分進一步闡述了根據這些準則所應負的責任。我根據這些準則，獨立於本集團，並已履行我的其他專業道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠及合適，可提供我的意見依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審核事項是指，根據我的專業判斷，於截至2021年12月31日的財務報表審核中，最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在我對財務報表整體審核的背景下處理的，並且在形成我的意見時也予以考慮，我不會就這些事項提供個別的意見。\n\n# 金融資產與金融負債以公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總額達港元4,502,475百萬，金融負債總額達港元1,150,861百萬，按公允價值估值。\n\n對於這 89% 的金融資產和所有金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層輸入），或用以估計技術，以可觀察市場數據為基礎估計（第二層輸入）。\n\n對於餘下11%的這些金融資產，其公允價值是用以估值技術估計，而這些技術的輸入並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第三級輸入）。 這些金融資產總值為港元517,316百萬，包括主要為未上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於大量的金額和所涉及的估計，以公允價值評估金融資產和金融負債為關鍵審計事項。\n\n審計程序包括針對金融資產及金融負債的公允價值評估。\n\n- 瞭解評估不同類別金融資產和金融負債的程序，包括相關控制措施；\n- 評估和測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n- 取得外部確認，以確認金融資產和金融負債的估值、存在性、權利和義務以及完整性；\n- 若使用報價市場價格，則驗證價格是否來自獨立來源；\n- 若使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並驗證輸入資料是否來自獨立資料來源；以及\n- 若使用非以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產按公允價值計價\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n集團的投資物業按其公允價值列帳，截至2021年12月31日總額達港元27,089百萬。集團亦持有1間聯營公司及21間合營公司權益，總額達港元45,172百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接舉辦，或由聯營公司或合營公司舉辦，主要以獨立專業估值師的估值為基礎制定。有關估值涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所運用的假設。\n\n對投資性物業以公允價值估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及檢視本集團直接或由聯營公司或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並驗證其公允價值是以估值報告中列帳的估值為基礎；\n評估估價師的獨立性及資格；以及\n評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港貨幣管理局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港貨幣管理局2021年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此表達任何形式的保証結論。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中考慮該資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中所取得的知識有重大不一致，或否則顯著失實。以我所執行工作的基礎，若我結論認為該資訊存在重大錯誤，我所需報告該事實。就此，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 貨幣管理機關及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7部分行政長官作出的指示，準備提供真實及公允的鑑於的財務報表，並為此確定必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表沒有部分由於欺詐或錯誤而產生重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在準備財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團繼續經營的能力，並在適用時披露與繼續經營相關的事項，並採用繼續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論部分由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並發行一份包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並非保證根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，一如既往能偵測到存在的重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若個別或總體而言，能合理預期會影響用戶根據這些財務報表所採取的經濟決策，則被探討為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則，我在審計過程中運用專業判斷，並維持懷疑態度全。我亦：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是部分由於舞弊或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且合適的審計證據，作為我提出意見的基礎。未能察覺因舞弊導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制之上；\n為設計適合情況的審計程序，取得與審計相關的內部控制理解，但並非用於對集團內部控制有效性發表意見；\n評估貨幣當局所使用的會計政策的合理性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n就貨幣當局使用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的活動或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計師報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的注意，若該等披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是以截至我審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據為基礎。然而，未來活動或情況可能導致集團無法繼續持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體呈現方式、結構及內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以達成公允呈現的方式反映其底層交易與活動；以及\n取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動財務資訊足夠且合適的審計證據，以便對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我與交易所基金諮詢委員會的審計小組委員會就審計的預計範圍及時間安排，以及重大審計結果進行溝通，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺失。\n\n我亦向財政儲備諮詢委員會的審計委員會提供聲明，證明我已遵守就獨立性而言的相關倫理要求，並與委員會溝通所有可能合理認為會對我的獨立性產生影響的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與交易所基金顧問委員會審計委員會溝通的事宜，我釐定於當前期間財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，因此這些是關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的不利後果會合理地超過此類溝通對公眾利益的福利，因而決定不將該事項納入報告中。\n\n朱約翰，審計總監\n"}
