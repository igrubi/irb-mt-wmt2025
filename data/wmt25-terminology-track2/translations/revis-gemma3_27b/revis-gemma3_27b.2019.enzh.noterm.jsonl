{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","zh":"2019年遠非平淡無奇。\n\n中美貿易緊張局勢仍然是揮之不去的變數。世界兩大經濟體之間的貿易談判持續不明朗，令投資者信心動搖，並對國際貿易、製造業、投資乃至消費造成不利影響。全球經濟擴張已不再是必然趨勢。當年全球經濟同步成長的景象已成往昔。為應對經濟成長趨緩，全球主要央行紛紛調整貨幣政策，由緊縮轉為寬鬆。\n\n本地社會事件在去年下半年對香港經濟造成進一步衝擊。零售、旅遊及飲食業受影響尤為嚴重。2019年全年，香港經濟萎縮1.2%，為十年來首次出現年度經濟負增長，失業率亦由年初的多年低點2.8%上升至3.3%。隨着2020年到來，新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19）疫情更對全球及本地經濟構成重大威脅。\n\n面對如此不確定且充滿挑戰的環境，維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定至關重要，正如我於2019年10月1日接任香港金融管理局行政總裁時所強調的。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定，乃國際金融中心之基石。\n\n自1983年實施的聯繫匯率制度，有助於香港應對多項挑戰和衝擊，充分體現了其作為香港經濟繁榮基石及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管外部及本地經濟環境充滿挑戰，聯繫匯率制度運作依然暢順且具秩序，再次證明其在不確定時期的韌性。香港銀行體系亦保持穩健。數據印證：港元匯率維持穩定，並在近月增強至可兌換區間強方，銀行存款亦持續增長。總而言之，並未見港元或銀行體系出現明顯資金外流情況。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行體系穩定，不僅反映其本身的穩健，更體現了社會對我們的信心。這種穩定並非一蹴而就，而是多年來建立緩衝機制、加強監測，並配合我們對社交媒體上謠言的迅速應對所致。\n\n多年來，我們為應對潛在風險所做的準備，已為香港的貨幣及銀行體系奠定了堅實的基礎，並構建了有效的風險緩衝。除了公共財政中充裕的外匯儲備外，本港銀行體系具備穩健的資本充足率、良好的流動性及優質的資產素質，無論從國際慣例或歷史經驗來看，均能保持領先。自2009年起推行的八輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，亦顯著提升了銀行體系在房地產市場調整時的抗風險能力。\n\n市場監察及銀行監理構成我們維持貨幣及銀行體系穩定工作之核心部分，我們持續加強監察及監理框架。除了密切監控銀行的信貸及流動性風險外，今年我們的新舉措是善用從銀行收集的科技及細粒度數據，以更深入及及時的方式提升對港元融資及金融市場活動的監控能力。 鑒於經濟及營運環境快速變化，我們亦已加強壓力測試及應急規劃。\n\n確實，我們的健全監管制度已獲得國際社會的廣泛認可。今年，國際貨幣基金組織重申，香港憑藉顯著的緩衝，具備應對週期性及結構性變動的良好條件。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資方面的有效法律及制度框架，亦獲得金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太地區首個在FATF相互評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，對維護貨幣及金融穩定至關重要。為鞏固市場信心，我們必須嚴加警惕，並迅速有效應對任何可能損害香港貨幣或銀行體系信譽的惡意揣測。鑑於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及，此舉尤為重要。在社會動盪期間，儘管有心人士在社交媒體上散播種種謠言，我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速且明確地闢謠，有效澄清事實、遏制謠言擴散，並維護國際社會及公眾對本港金融體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要基石，在確保社會與經濟順暢運作方面扮演著舉足輕重的角色。儘管自今年下半年以來營運環境充滿挑戰，銀行業仍與各界攜手努力，竭盡所能維持核心業務的正常運作，並持續為企業和公眾提供服務。\n\n除了基本的銀行服務，例如存款和轉帳外，銀行亦肩負著向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟的重要功能。我們深知並關注在現時經濟環境下，企業，尤其是中小企業所面臨的現金流問題。為確保銀行體系穩定，同時持續支援中小企業的融資需求，我們已採取一系列措施。具體而言，銀行逆周期資本緩衝比率已於2019年10月及2020年3月兩次調降，總計150個基點，降至1.0%；銀行存款準備金率亦於2020年4月減半。這些措施釋放了約1萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行向企業（包括中小企業）提供更多貸款空間。此外，我們成立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，匯集香港主要銀行，共同探討加強對中小企業資金支持的具體方案。我們很高興看到多家銀行積極響應，並為有需要的客戶推出本金延期償還等措施，協助他們度過難關。\n\n鑑於中小企業普遍反映開設銀行帳戶存在困難，而開設銀行帳戶是獲取各項銀行服務的首要步驟，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在過去幾年積極致力解決此問題。 相關工作已見成效，企業開戶情況有所改善。為進一步推動金融包容性，香港金融管理局主導推出了分層帳戶服務，即簡化客戶盡職審查程序的簡易銀行帳戶（SBAs），為初創企業和中小企業提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。 截至目前，已開設超過2,800個簡易銀行帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上\n\n我們一向重視在規管與發展之間取得適當的平衡。 鑒於金融中心競爭日益激烈，我們必須努力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，以確保其長遠穩定。目前工作的重點包括科技、綠色金融、與內地金融互聯互通，以及人才培養。\n\n# 善用科技於數位時代\n\n自2016年香港金融管理局成立金融科技促進辦公室，及2017年推出智慧銀行計劃以來，香港積極推動金融科技發展。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的蓬勃發展，充分體現在快速支付系統（FPS）的強勁勢頭。FPS是全球首個支援多種貨幣、跨銀行及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台。短短十五個月內，FPS的註冊用戶已突破四百萬，在七百五十萬人口中佔有相當高的比率。政府亦已採用FPS，為公眾提供繳納稅款、地價及水費等項目的便利。預料未來將有越來越多企業採用這項快速、安全且便捷的支付方式，藉此提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業方面，金融科技於銀行服務及業務運作的應用已取得顯著進展。香港金融管理局的研究顯示，近九成受訪零售銀行已採用或計劃採用人工智能於其業務應用中。在金管局的積極推動下，銀行已將大數據及消費者行為分析應用於個人信貸產品。此外，銀行已在首兩階段推出逾八百個開放應用程式介面（API），涵蓋多種銀行產品及服務。儘管鼓勵銀行應用金融科技，我們亦未忽視加強科技風險管理及數碼銀行服務消費者保護的必要性。金管局已及時向銀行提供相關監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行業備受關注的領域之一，其潛力在於協助銀行更有效率、更經濟地執行法規遵循與風險管理，尤其是在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界廣泛採用Regtech並建立更完善的Regtech生態系統，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於十一月主辦首屆AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發布首期Regtech通訊，探討Regtech的潛在應用。與此同時，HKMA亦積極探索運用監管科技（Suptech），包括新興的數據科學與分析技術，以提升監管效能。我們已展開一系列研究，並制定未來數年的Suptech實施路線圖。\n\n從更宏觀的層面來看，這僅僅是金融科技在銀行業發展的起點。香港金融管理局於本年度發出八張虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行已於2020年3月正式開始營運，而其他一些虛擬銀行則已透過香港金融管理局的金融科技監管沙盒展開先導試驗。我期待其他虛擬銀行能盡快推出服務，並為香港市民帶來更多創新且多元化的銀行服務，從而提升我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n預期在國際層面亦將有更多令人振奮的發展。在成功完成概念驗證（PoC）試驗，將我們的區塊鏈貿易融資平台 eTradeConnect（「貿連通」）與其歐洲對應平台連接後，我們正與中國人民銀行平台進行另一次PoC試驗，為跨境貿易的數位化奠定基礎。我們已與泰國銀行展開聯合研究項目，以研究央行數字貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行（BIS）亦於11月在香港啟用了其首個創新中心，旨在促進中央銀行界別內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地顯示香港在全球金融科技發展領域的領先地位。\n\n# 促進綠色永續金融，裨益更美好未來。\n\n與氣候相關的風險近年來已引起全球日益增長的關注。為貢獻全球應對此挑戰的努力，香港金融管理局於五月公布三項關鍵措施，從不同途徑推動香港綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（金管局）正採取三階段策略，以推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。第一階段已制定評估銀行「綠色程度」的框架，現供業界諮詢，為第二階段確立銀行業的監管期望與要求，並於第三階段落實相關措施。\n\n作為匯換基金的管理機構，香港金融管理局積極推動負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入投資活動中。具體而言，我們採納的原則是，若綠色及ESG投資在風險調整後，其長期回報與其他投資大致相若，則予以優先考慮。自2015年作為早期投資者之一參與綠色債券市場以來，我們將持續擴大綠色債券投資組合，並投資其他ESG相關資產。此外，我們亦將與具備相同願景的投資者及監管機構攜手合作，透過參與ESG領域的國際組織，共同推動ESG最佳實踐。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n二零一九年，香港經濟出現萎縮，反映全球經濟增長放緩、中美貿易摩擦持續，以及本地社會事件的影響。隨著經濟狀況在下半年迅速惡化，勞動市場面臨日益增大的壓力。此外，豬肉價格急劇上漲也推升了通貨膨脹。預計二零二零年的經濟表現仍將充滿挑戰，因為新型冠狀病毒疫情對本已疲弱的經濟造成打擊。鑒於艱難的經濟環境，政府與香港金融管理局已推出一系列措施以支持經濟，特別是針對家庭和中小企業。\n\n# 經濟概況\n\n# 實體活動\n\n繼2018年經濟成長2.9%後，香港經濟在2019年萎縮1.2%，為自2009年以來首次出現年度經濟負成長。尤其在下半年，經濟已陷入衰退，經季節調整後的實際本地生產總值（GDP）連續第二、三、四個季度下滑（表1）。經濟活動的減緩主要反映本地需求顯著減少（圖1）。由於社會事件對消費活動及市場情緒造成重大影響，私人消費支出自2003年以來首次錄得年度下降。整體投資意願亦因企業信心疲弱而下滑。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩，加上中美貿易摩擦導致的額外關稅，使香港商品出口下降。服務出口亦創下歷史最大年度跌幅，源於社會事件嚴重衝擊了入境旅遊。本地及轉口需求均告萎縮，進口商品及服務亦隨之惡化。整體而言，2019年淨貿易對GDP的貢獻為正（圖1），因為總進口量降幅高於總出口量。\n\n鑑於經濟下行壓力，政府於二零一九年八月至十二月期間推出多輪措施，以減輕居民的財政負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企業（SMEs）以及受影響較大的行業，例如零售、餐飲、運輸及旅遊業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟並緩和經濟週期，香港金融管理局於十月十四日宣布將銀行的逆週期資本緩衝比率由2.5%調降至2.0%，藉此為銀行提供更多彈性，釋放港幣2000億至3000億元的銀行信貸予企業，包括中小企業，並成立銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制。九月，中小企業融資擔保計劃（SFGS）推出新的80%擔保產品紓緩措施，讓現金流減弱的中小企業借款人可申請本金寬限期以獲得即時支援。此外，十二月推出SFGS下的新90%貸款擔保產品，以進一步支持中小企業、經營經驗較少的企業以及專業人士設立個人專業業務以取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。港元匯率全 year 大致穩定。由於3月觸發弱方兌換保證，香港金融管理局以每1美元7.85港元的匯率向銀行購入港元，並售出美元，導致總結餘因應聯繫匯率制度的設計而下降。港元銀行間利率長端大致維持穩定，而短端則普遍上升。在零售層面，多家零售銀行於10月下旬隨美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調後，將最優惠貸款利率調低12.5個基點。至於貨幣供應量，2019年銀行總貸款增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%顯著上升，總存款則增長2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基礎通貨膨脹率由2018年的2.6%微升至2019年的3.0%。通脹溫和上升主要受到自5月起鮮豬肉供應受阻導致豬肉價格上漲的推動（見圖2）。剔除基本食品項目，全年物價壓力維持在溫和水平。特別是，消費者物價指數中的住房部分隨著私人住宅租金較早出現調整而有所緩和。更廣泛而言，名義工資溫和增長以及商業租金增幅放緩有助於控制本地企業成本。外部方面，進口物價通脹放緩，與全球經濟增長放緩下香港部分主要進口來源地的通脹率下降相符。\n\n# 就業市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場大致維持穩健，但下半年則面臨壓力增大的挑戰（圖表3）。經季節調整後，失業率在首季及次季維持於多年低位的2.8%，隨後在第三季升至2.9%，第四季進一步升至3.3%。受社會事件影響，與消費及旅遊相關行業的失業率上升尤為顯著。整體勞動需求在下半年顯著減弱，總就業人數與私營部門職位空缺均有下降。勞動需求減弱尤其體現在零售、住宿及餐飲服務業，以及進出口貿易和建築業。在勞動力供應方面，勞動參與率略有下降，部分原因是經濟衰退的週期性影響。隨著勞動市場壓力增加，年底名義工資及薪資增長趨緩。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷顯著波動。年初至四月市場反彈後，受制於中美貿易摩擦再趨緊張的擔憂，恆生指數於五月急跌（見圖表4）。儘管六月主要央行釋出更寬鬆貨幣政策的信號，市場一度收復部分失地，但隨後全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件再添壓力，股價再度承壓。年底，美國與中國內地達成「第一階段」貿易協議的消息公布後，股市重拾升勢。恆生指數全年收於28,190點，累計上漲9.1%。相對而言，平均每日成交額較去年下降約19%。一間主要內地科技公司及一間領先啤酒製造商的上市，推動2019年首次公開招股（IPO）集資額增至3,142億港元。香港在2019年連續第二年成為全球IPO集資額最高的地區。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n二零一九年前五個月，住宅物業市場強勁反彈，但其後餘下時間則趨於軟化。年初市場氣氛因中美貿易緊張局勢一度緩和而有所改善，隨後卻因緊張局勢再次升級、社會事件持續，以及本地經濟狀況轉弱而受抑。整體樓價在五月高峰期至十二月期間溫和回落約5%，但由於首五個月已反彈10%，全年樓價仍錄得5%的增長（見圖表4）。二零一九年物業交易量較去年增加4%，達59,797個單位，反映年初交易活動暢旺。房屋負擔能力仍然吃緊，價格與收入比及收入負擔比率分別維持在17.9和80.9的高位，遠高於長期平均水平。為協助有即時住房需求的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMC）於十月中旬提高按揭保險計劃下，合資格住宅物業的估值上限。另一方面，非住宅物業市場在二零一九年面臨更大的下行壓力。特別是零售商鋪的價格和租金自二零零八年全球金融危機以來錄得最大跌幅，反映當年營商環境持續惡化。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港2020年的經濟表現預料將具備相當大的挑戰，並伴隨新冠疫情爆發所帶來的顯著下行風險。零售、住宿、餐飲、旅遊和交通等行業，在尚未從早前社會事件的影響中完全復甦的情況下，將再次遭受衝擊。然而，2020\/21年度財政預算案中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金派發，以及在信貸保障計劃下提供政府百分百擔保的新優惠低息貸款，料將為經濟，特別是家庭和中小企業提供支持。香港金融管理局於2020年3月16日進一步將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率從2.0%降低至1.0%，藉此鼓勵銀行更積極地支持本地經濟，尤其協助預期因疫情而面臨短期壓力的行業和個人。從GDP組成部分分析，由於消費者和企業信心仍然脆弱，私人消費和投資可能持續偏弱。雖然政府消費將有助於經濟增長，但隨著部分大型基建項目的竣工，公共投資開支預計將相對趨緩。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議短期內對本地經濟的影響被視為略為正面。然而，香港的對外貿易表現仍將受到全球經濟增長乏力和貿易流量低迷的拖累。特別是，疫情可能導致區域供應鏈中斷和跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，進而影響香港的出口。政府預測2020年實際GDP增長介於-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織和私人分析師的預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n預期由於經濟增長放緩、私人住宅租賃市場趨於穩定以及溫和的進口通貨膨脹，2020年的通貨膨脹壓力將有所減緩。市場普遍預測2020年的整體通貨膨脹率為1.8%，而政府則預測整體通貨膨脹率與核心通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%與2.5%。在勞動市場方面，鑒於經濟前景疲弱及新冠疫情的影響，失業率在短期內可能進一步上升。民間機構分析師預計2020年的失業率將升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性及風險\n\n二零二零年的經濟展望相對保守，面臨諸多不確定性與風險，包括全球經濟增長放緩、中美貿易關係、中國大陸經濟表現、本地社會事件，以及新型冠狀病毒疫情持續擴散等因素。尤其值得關注的是，疫情若持續蔓延，可能引發更明顯的全球經濟減速，並導致資產重新定價，進而造成不利的宏觀經濟環境與更趨緊縮的金融條件，對國內實體經濟活動構成進一步的下行壓力。然而，主要中央銀行採取更協調一致的貨幣寬鬆政策，或可為疫情造成的負面經濟影響提供一定程度的緩衝。\n\n# 銀行業績效\n\n香港銀行業於2019年雖面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張及本地社會事件等多重挑戰，仍展現韌性。銀行資產負債表趨勢穩健，貸款及存款均溫和增長。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況保持充裕，資產品質亦維持良好水準。銀行業盈利能力穩定，平均資產報酬率亦保持穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n2019年，香港的港元匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順且穩定。港元匯率全年保持穩定，並在年底趨向可兌換範圍的強方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度多次證明其抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即港幣兌美元的匯率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內保持穩定。香港的貨幣制度採用聯繫匯率制度，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有100%的美元儲備於外匯基金作支持，而貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對等。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表 1）包括：\n\n債務憑證為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保。\n\n政府發行的流通紙幣和硬幣的總結餘，即各銀行在香港金融管理局（金管局）持有的清算賬戶餘額總計。\n\n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的交換基金票據（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，仰賴自動調整利率機制，以及香港金融管理局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方聯繫匯率承諾水平，即每1美元7.75港元時，金管局隨時準備依銀行要求出售港元以換取美元。此舉將擴大總結餘，降低港元利率，從而營造有利於港元匯率脫離強方限位，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區間內的貨幣狀況。反之，若港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方聯繫匯率承諾水平，即每1美元7.85港元時，金管局亦隨時準備依銀行要求購入港元。此舉將收縮總結餘，提高港元利率，從而推動港元匯率遠離弱方限位，並維持在兌換區間內。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，且本地經濟增長放緩，2019年港元仍保持穩定，並以平穩有序的方式進行交易。年初時，港元與美元的負利率差擴大，吸引市場進行賣港元買美元的套利交易，導致港元匯率向聯繫匯率制度的弱方觸及水平7.85靠攏（見圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續走弱，3月份該弱方觸及水平共觸發八次。此後，港元匯率持續維持在7.85的弱方觸及水平附近。自5月下旬起，由於規模龐大的首次公開募股（IPO）活動、企業股息支付需求以及中期結算，港元需求增強，推動港元匯率走強。雖然半年結算後港元匯率一度回落，但自10月下旬起重新獲得動能，並在年底時維持在聯繫匯率制度的強方水平。這反映了部分與股權相關的需求，包括IPO活動，以及年底流動性收緊導致的港元空頭頭寸平倉。總體而言，2019年港元外匯市場運作正常。\n\n由於弱方聯繫匯率機制啟動，總結餘（撇除貼現窗口）與未償還結單票據總額，由2018年底的1,136.2億港元降至2019年底的1,133.0億港元（見圖2）。當年，香港金管局根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，應銀行要求，在弱方聯繫匯率水平7.85購入總額22.1億港元，導致總結餘（撇除貼現窗口）從2018年底的76.4億港元收縮至2019年底的54.3億港元。未償還結單票據則略有增加，由1,059.8億港元增至1,078.7億港元，反映了為支付結單票據利息而發行結單票據，符合既定慣例。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。截至2019年底，總結餘（撇除貼現窗口）與未償還結單票據總額為1,133億港元。\n\n# 資金市場\n\n2019年，港元銀行間利率長端大致維持穩定，而短端利率則普遍上升（圖3）。短端利率亦因首次公開募股（IPO）相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需求而出現較大波動。自2018年4月以來，總結餘減少，可能使港元銀行間利率對本地市場港元資金供需變化更加敏感。\n\n二零一八年底，基準利率為2.75%。其後於二零一八年八月一日、九月十九日及十月三十一日分別下調，共計75個基點，降至二零一八年十一月初的2.00%。此舉與美國聯邦基金利率目標區間同期三次下調，總計75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%有關。二零一八年十一月十八日至二十六日及十二月十九日至三十一日期間，基準利率高於2.00%，反映當年最後兩個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的隔夜及一個月期利率顯著上升。因此，基準利率於二零一九年底收報2.49%。基準利率的調整遵循二零零九年三月二十六日公布的修訂公式，該公式規定基準利率定為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月HIBOR五日移動平均數的平均值，取較高者。在零售方面，多家零售銀行在十月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調後，隨之將最優惠貸款利率下調12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期點數在年初兩個月擴大，大致與港元兌美元利率差的變動同步，至二月中旬，12個月期港元遠期點數觸及約-708點（見圖4）。隨後，隨著港元兌美元負利率差的縮小，港元遠期點數的折扣亦逐步收窄，並在年底轉為升水。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作有序。2019年，貼現窗借款減少至383億港元，較2018年的402億港元減少。\n\n# 連結匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度在過去三十多年來為香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重要貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其韌性。今年因應社會事件的發生，社交媒體上出現了一些無根據的謠言，質疑聯繫匯率制度及香港的金融穩定。香港金融管理局隨即採取有力行動，透過傳統媒體和社交媒體闢謠，向公眾堅定地保證聯繫匯率制度將維持不變，香港不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局亦發布多篇文章，協助公眾了解聯繫匯率制度的運作原理、資金流動情況以及利率展望。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯繫匯率制度的信心，全年市場的有序運作便是明證。政府亦堅定支持聯繫匯率制度，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了公眾對政府承諾及港元作為支付及價值儲存工具的信心。在2019年對香港進行的第四條諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織重申了其長期以來對聯繫匯率制度的支持，認為這制度是香港金融穩定的重要基石，也是香港適當的匯率安排，其背後有香港透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、健全的金融監管和監督、彈性的經濟以及審慎的財政框架作為支撐。\n\n健全的銀行體系對於聯網系統的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業具備高度流動性及穩健的財務狀況，其流動性水平與資本充足率均顯著高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局（金管局）持續密切監察銀行在信貸、流動性及利率風險方面的管理，並評估壓力測試結果，同時加強對企業、物業及內地相關貸款的監管。儘管銀行總結餘較過往減少，但各銀行普遍已強化流動性管理，並更積極地處理日常資金調度。此外，金管局與銀行保持緊密溝通，確保市場流動資金的暢順運作，尤其是在大型首次公開招股（IPO）認購期前後。年內並未出現結算問題，貼現窗口亦持續高效運作。\n\n為提高外匯基金帳戶的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分撥作支持貨幣基礎。二零一九年，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在109.9%至112.1%的區間內，未觸及上下限的觸發點。截至十二月三十一日，該比率收報111.2%（見圖5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，雖然已指定部分外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可動用以維持港元匯率穩定。若發生突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強有力的支持。\n\n# 其他活動項目\n\n貨幣發行局諮詢委員會的貨幣發行局小組委員會（CBC）負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。二零一九年，小組委員會審議的議題包括一份有關聯繫匯率制度（LERS）運作的事件研究、香港總結餘與利率之間的關係、改善及更具彈性的方法以評估期權市場對聯繫匯率制度的看法，以及未來首次公開招股對香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的影響。有關小組委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予小組委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，均已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 研習\n\n香港貨幣與金融研究院（HKIMR），前身為香港貨幣研究院，致力於針對貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域進行具政策參考價值的研究。這體現在HKIMR研究人員與海外訪客所探討的多樣化研究主題，以及其舉辦的研討會和各項活動中。HKIMR與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為重點的研討會。其研究訪問計劃支持針對香港金融管理局、香港及區域內重要的政策議題研究。\n\n2019年，香港國際貨幣研究所共接待了十四位研究學者，發表了十七篇工作論文，並舉辦了十一場公開研討會，內容涉及廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。該研究所亦主辦了三場國際會議。\n\n第十屆國際中華經濟研討會，題為「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」，於一月十日至十一日在香港舉行，由香港國際金融中心研究院、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心聯合主辦。本次研討會為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的專家學者提供了一個高水準的交流平台，共同探討金融改革及中國大陸經濟發展所帶來的變化，以及這些變化對中國大陸金融體系所構成的風險與挑戰。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港銀行業於二零一九年保持穩健及穩定，即使全球及本地經濟均面臨下行壓力亦然。業界通力合作，銀行業在社會事件期間運作暢順。相關措施已採取，以盡量減輕對公眾可能造成的不便。當年，香港金融管理局將監管重點放在授權機構的信貸及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡安全威脅日增，以及銀行業對科技的依賴程度不斷提高，香港金融管理局亦加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監察。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局精簡投資者保護措施，提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。此外，我們亦加強了數碼金融服務的消費者保護，並持續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組對香港AML\/CFT制度進行第四輪相互評估的完成。評估結果顯示，香港的AML\/CFT制度整體符合標準且有效，尤其肯定銀行業對風險的良好理解，以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）在AML\/CFT領域的風險為本監管工作。香港金融管理局持續參與公私合作的詐騙及洗錢情報共享機制，並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，香港金融管理局於二零一九年向八間虛擬銀行頒發銀行牌照，並公布一項分三階段的方案，以推動香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。香港金融管理局與銀行業界保持緊密聯繫，致力優化監管政策和流程，並推行能力建設措施，以提升人才素質。\n\n同時，本地在落實國際監管標準方面取得了顯著進展，包括資本充足率標準、信息披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險敞口標準。香港金融管理局亦持續致力確保持牌金融機構設有可信的決議機制，包括落實有關吸收損失能力的要求，以提升持牌金融機構的有序清盤能力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於金融體系具備高度韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需關鍵的金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務營運方式，以及在極端情況下以不穩妥的方式終止營運，均可能影響金融體系的穩定。香港金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的韌性，並能在危機中恢復其運作能力，從而有效預防銀行倒閉。香港金融管理局負責對香港銀行進行審慎監管，職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（Authorized Institutions，簡稱AIs）。香港金融管理局亦負責指定及監察若干金融市場基礎設施（Financial Market Infrastructures，簡稱FMIs）。\n\n然而，金管局無法保證金融體系零風險，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在達到此目的。相反，金管局作為處置機構，致力於確保當某間金融機構出現經營困難時，其破產事宜能以有序方式處理。為此，香港已建立金融機構處置機制，金管局在此機制中擔任處置機構。為確保此機制有效運作，制定相關的法律及政策標準、進行處置規劃以消除影響金融機構可處置性的障礙，並提升金管局處理陷入困境金融機構的能力至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採取與國際接軌且協調一致的處理方式。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n於二零一九年，香港金融管理局共進行了196次非現場檢視，覆蓋範圍廣泛，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。為持續推動更強風險治理，香港金融管理局與持牌機構董事會或董事級委員會召開了26次會晤。此外，香港金融管理局、持牌機構及其外部審計師亦召開了32次三方會晤。\n\n除了定期進行現場檢查外，香港金融管理局亦會針對風險較高的範疇，進行深入主題式審查。本年度共完成405項現場檢查及主題式審查。信貸風險管理持續為重點關注領域。科技風險及營運風險管理亦為另一主要關注對象。香港金融管理局同時增加對流動性風險、市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足度框架落實情況的審查力度。此外，專業團隊亦對持牌金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金相關業務的活動進行審查。\n\n表 1 載列香港金融管理局 2019 年監理活動的整體摘要。\n\n# 信用風險監督\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n銀行貸款在2019年增長適度。總貸款額增長6.7%，較2018年的4.4%為高。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款及用於香港以外地區的貸款分別增長7.7%及5.8%。\n\n截至2019年末，與內地相關的貸款增長7.4%，達到4,564億港元（見表3）。\n\n資產品質維持健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年底的0.51%微降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。整體銀行業的分類貸款比率則略增至0.57%，較去年同期的0.55%略高。針對中國大陸的貸款方面，零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，但仍低於歷史水準。整體銀行業的比率則從0.55%上升至0.75%。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局加強了監管工作，以確保認可金融機構在不確定的經濟環境下繼續採取審慎的信貸風險管理標準。壓力測試已加強，涵蓋更全面的風險範圍，並採用更嚴峻的壓力假設。經加強的壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行普遍擁有充足的資本緩衝，足以應對極端衝擊。香港金融管理局亦進行了針對性和主題性的審查，評估認可金融機構在不同領域的信貸風險管理措施，例如向從事高風險業務的公司貸款、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的抵押貸款。鑒於中小企業在經濟下行期間可能面臨更大的挑戰，香港金融管理局於十月成立銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，旨在鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內，繼續支持中小企業的融資需求。\n\n# 不動產抵押貸款\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局已推出八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，顯著增強了香港銀行業抵禦樓市下行風險的能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%降至2019年12月的53%。同期，新按揭貸款的平均債務收入比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次設定上限時的41%，降至2019年12月的36%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監察\n\n香港金融管理局採用三階段方式推行網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）下的網絡韌性評估框架。第一階段評估已於二零一八年完成，涵蓋所有主要銀行。第二及第三階段所涉及的其他金融機構已大致完成評估，僅剩少量細節待處理。香港金融管理局亦已展開對CFI的全面檢討，以根據過去數年的經驗優化該計劃。\n\n十月，香港金融管理局發佈了修訂版的《監管政策手冊》（SPM）模組，內容關於「電子銀行風險管理」。此次修訂旨在為業界提供更大的靈活性，以應對電子銀行服務方面不斷變化的客戶期望。香港金融管理局亦同時發佈了一套關於人工智慧應用的高層原則，以供業界參考。\n\n自六月社會事件爆發以來，香港金融管理局一直與業界保持密切溝通，以監察事件對銀行營運及服務的影響。金管局要求銀行更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）的現金，並盡快修復遭破壞的設施。同時，金管局亦迅速採取行動，澄清旨在削弱公眾對銀行體系信心的惡意謠言。 感謝銀行業界的通力合作，受影響的銀行分行及設施已迅速恢復正常服務，並將對公眾造成的不便降至最低。 鑑於社會事件導致的營運風險顯著上升，金管局要求銀行採取額外預防措施，以加強營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理之監理\n\n本年度進行了一輪主題性審查，以評估授權機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點為授權機構流動性壓力測試計劃的穩健性及應急融資管理。香港金融管理局亦評估授權機構在計算流動性覆蓋比率（Liquidity Coverage Ratio，LCR）方面的合規情況，以確保計算所使用的輸入數據的謹慎性與準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業的日益普及，香港金融管理局（金管局）進行了一輪主題審查，以評估採用算法交易的金融機構在該領域的風險管理實踐。鑒於倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止發布，金管局提醒這些金融機構為過渡至替代參考利率做好準備，並進行調查以監察其過渡準備情況。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐融資\n\n香港金融管理局對持牌機構的反洗錢／反恐融資系統進行基於風險的監管。本年度共進行了18次現場檢查及61次非現場審閱，其中包括針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理的主題性審閱。香港金融管理局與業界分享了主題性審閱的觀察結果及最佳做法，該審閱涵蓋持牌機構應用基於風險的洗錢及恐怖主義融資控制措施的情況，旨在協助持牌機構採用適當的開戶程序及為中小企業提供服務。\n\n# 金融行動任務組（FATF）關於香港的相互評估報告\n\n香港金融管理局及香港整體反洗錢／反恐融資制度於2019年的重要亮點，是9月發布的金融行動特別小組（FATF）對香港的互評報告。 該報告代表了FATF第四輪互評中，成員司法管轄區所取得的最佳整體成果之一。香港在評估其反洗錢／反恐融資制度成效的11項「即時效益」中，獲得6項「重大」評級，並在互評的技術合規方面也獲得高分。\n\n報告評估香港金融管理局（HKMA）以風險為本的反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）監管方法，認為其對銀行業洗錢及恐怖融資（ML\/TF）風險有充分認識，並對儲值支付工具（SVF）業的風險有合理評估。報告亦肯定銀行業界在AML\/CFT方面的整體努力，包括大型授權金融機構增加運用數據分析、絕大多數可疑交易報告由授權金融機構提交，以及業界積極參與詐騙及洗錢情報小組（FMLIT）的工作。\n\n報告建議在多個方面加以改進，包括對若干高風險領域的了解，例如外國貪腐及逃稅犯罪，以及新興行業如特殊用途載具（SVF）。為應對這些建議，相關工作已展開；香港金融管理局於七月發布了有關SVF行業的更新版洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估報告，並已開始針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理進行主題式現場檢查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2019年全球金融市場表現優於預期，主要央行的寬鬆貨幣政策抵消了對全球經濟增長放緩和中美貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。在2018年第四季經歷顯著調整後，全球股市隨之反彈，而主要政府債券殖利率則下跌，債券價格則上漲。在這種有利的環境下，外匯基金於2019年錄得投資收益2622億港元，相當於投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》的規定，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯價。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全，以協助鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局根據財政司司長授予的權力，並在授權範圍內，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n港幣兌換基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）為港幣兌換基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保持資本不變；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高流動性美元資產作為擔保；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合（a）至（c）的前提下，實現投資回報，以協助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了匯換基金的法定宗旨，並已融入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置。\n\n外匯基金廣義而言設有兩個主要投資組合：後盾投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。後盾投資組合持有高度流動的美元計價資產，旨在依照貨幣板制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供完全的保障。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場，以維護其資產的價值和長遠購買力。\n\n為更有效管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局會以審慎及逐步的方式，策略性地將部分外匯基金的投資配置至更廣泛的資產類別。這些資產類別包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票的投資由投資組合（IP）持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）的投資市值上限，定為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，加上未來基金及外匯基金附屬機構對LTGP的投資總額。\n\n戰略投資組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，由政府代表結匯基金出資購入，用作策略用途。鑒於其獨特性，此投資組合不納入基金投資表現評估範圍。\n\n# 外匯基金的投資配置\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的資金配置。利率一般與投資組合表現相關，但未來基金為例外，其利率與投資組合表現及長期政府債券均有連繫，並根據投資組合比例而定。截至2019年底，未來基金在投資組合表現與長期政府債券之間的配置比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n交易所基金的投資流程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表交易所基金根據其投資目標所定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以期實現超越基準的超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。投資基準及追蹤誤差上限由財政司與交易所基金顧問委員會磋商後確定，而戰術決策及戰術偏離的容許幅度則由香港金融管理局在授權範圍內制定。在容許的戰術偏離幅度內，投資組合經理可建立倉位以捕捉短期市場波動的機會。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局於2018年8月設立外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以統籌其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO的職員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資組合，其中包括全部的基礎貨幣部分（BP）及部分投資組合（IP）。這部分投資組合涵蓋投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資標的，以及用於實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 外聘管理人員\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦委任外部基金經理管理約佔外匯基金資產29%的資金，其中包括其所有上市股權投資組合及其他專業資產類別。 委任外部經理旨在充分利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，並藉由多元且互補的投資策略，提升投資表現，同時獲取他們對市場的獨到見解及專業技術。\n\n聘用外部管理人所產生的支出包括基金管理費、托管費用、交易成本以及預扣稅費和其他稅費。此項支出主要受市場因素影響，可能每年有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規。\n\n投資環境日益複雜，進一步凸顯風險管理的重要性。為內部及外部管理的投資組合制定了嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並對其遵守情況及相關法規進行密切監察。 隨著投資環境的演變日趨複雜，風險評估已得到加強，以支持外匯基金投資組合多元化的提升。風險控制工具被應用於評估正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險。此外，亦會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，從而協助香港金融管理局評估如何善用內外部經理的投資技能。\n\n# 社會責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治因素融入外匯基金的公眾及私人市場投資流程。\n\n在公共市場投資方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）實施與程序及投資相關的措施。香港金融管理局採納的一項與程序相關的措施，是證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《負責任擁有原則》（PRO），藉此協助投資者確定在投資香港上市公司的過程中，如何最佳地履行其所有權責任。在管理貨幣發行保證基金的過程中，香港金融管理局已制定內部指引，涵蓋外部基金管理人的甄選、任命及監察程序中的環境、社會及企業管治（ESG）因素。香港金融管理局委任的外部基金管理人，在管理其香港股票及內地主動股票投資組合時，須根據「遵守或解釋」原則遵守《負責任擁有原則》；而委任管理香港金融管理局於已發展市場股票投資組合的外部基金管理人，則須遵守國際公認的ESG標準。除了外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦已納入香港金融管理局內部管理的債券投資信用風險分析中。\n\n至於公開市場的ESG投資，香港金融管理局自2015年起即為綠色債券的早期投資者之一，並參與國際金融公司主辦的共同貸款投資組合計劃，該計劃專注於新興市場的可持續投資。未來，香港金融管理局將繼續透過直接投資或投資綠色債券基金等方式擴充綠色債券投資組合。此外，香港金融管理局計劃在股票投資中構建ESG主題的投資策略，採用ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並與在投資決策中應用ESG因素的主動股票經理合作。\n\n關於私人市場投資，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在盡職調查過程中會審視普通合夥人的環境、社會及管治（ESG）政策與實踐。尤其在所有長期普通合夥人投資（LTGP）中，ESG風險評估均為盡職調查的必要環節。針對LTGP，香港金融管理局投資具可持續特色的項目；例如，自2013年起，香港金融管理局已透過直接投資及共同投資，涉足能源領域的可再生能源，並在其房地產投資組合中投資具備綠色及可持續特色的綠色建築和倉庫。今後，香港金融管理局將持續尋找具可持續特色的項目，並將綠色認證納為房地產投資的主要考量因素。\n\n香港金融管理局將密切監測ESG標準的發展，並評估其如何進一步融入投資流程。此舉得益於與志同道合的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則（UNPRI）的簽署機構，香港金融管理局期望參與ESG最佳實踐的制定，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦是FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織透過研討會和研究，致力於鼓勵企業和投資決策更著重長遠發展。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作小組的支持者。\n\n如需了解香港金融管理局（金管局）責任投資政策框架的更多詳情，請參閱《企業社會責任》章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的運作情況\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管全球經濟增長趨緩，且美中貿易關係緊張，但主要央行採取寬鬆貨幣政策，帶動2019年全球金融市場表現優異。2018年第四季經歷一波顯著修正後，全球股市在2019年逐步回升。債券市場方面，由於貨幣寬鬆，主要政府債券收益率在2019年前三季顯著下滑，債券價格則隨之攀升。雖然第四季隨著收益率略有反彈，債券價格一度回落，但2019年整體而言，債券市場仍獲利豐厚。\n\n在外匯市場中，主要貨幣對美元匯率走勢各異。受中美貿易緊張局勢升級影響，人民幣在第三季下跌3.8%，但隨著第四季貿易關係緩和，部分回升了前期跌幅。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值1.4%。另一方面，由於第三季無協議脫歐的風險升高，英鎊下跌3.2%，但隨著第四季英國脫歐局勢逐步明朗，其後顯著反彈，最終對美元升值4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n#香港交換基金的表現\n\n香港交換基金於二零一九年錄得投資收入港幣二百六十二億二千萬元。其中，債券增值港幣一百一十四億五千萬元，香港股票增值港幣二十二億一千萬元，其他股票增值港幣一百零零億七千萬元，非港幣資產的貨幣換算影響為負港幣十三億元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益港幣三十七億九千萬元。另計，策略投資組合錄得估值收益港幣二十五億元。\n\n於年末，交換基金總資產達港幣4,206.7億元。長期投資計劃（LTGP，長期投資組合）的投資市值總額為港幣3,351億元，其中私募股本為港幣2,334億元，房地產為港幣1,017億元。未償還投資承諾額達港幣2,193億元。\n\n2019年，扣除策略投資組合後，儲備基金的投資回報率為6.6%。具體而言，IP投資組合的回報率為9.7%，Bp則為2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部回報率為12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n","zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計主任報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見專欄\n\n我謹此證明，我已審計了交易基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）於第187至293頁所載的財務報表，包括本集團截至2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的損益表、綜合收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，其中包含重要的會計政策摘要。\n\n我認為，截至二零一九年十二月三十一日，該基金及集團的財務報表真實及公允地反映了當時的財務狀況，並已根據香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港財務報告準則」）編製，以及符合根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官指示的規定。此等報表亦已妥善地反映了該年度的財務表現及現金流量。\n\n# 論據\n\n我根據《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我在此標準下的責任，詳情請參閱我報告書中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節。我與該集團保持獨立，符合該等準則的要求，並已履行其他相關的專業道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據充分且適當，足以作為我發表意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指根據我的專業判斷，審計2019年12月31日財務報表時認為最為重要的事項。這些事項已在整體財務報表審計的背景下加以處理，並用以形成我的審計意見，但我對這些事項不另行發表意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債按公允價值估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總額為港幣3,874,223百萬，金融負債總額為港幣1,158,686百萬，均以公允價值計量。\n\n對於 91% 的這些金融資產和所有這些金融負債，其公允價值均以活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（Level 1 輸入）為基礎，或以基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術進行估計（Level 2 輸入）。\n\n其餘9%的金融資產，其公允價值乃採用非以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術（第三層輸入值）進行估算。 這些金融資產總計港幣3,387億5,800萬元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於金額重大且涉及複雜估計，金融資產和金融負債按公允價值計量為關鍵審計事項。\n\n財務資產及金融負債公允價值之計量審計程序包括：\n\n了解評估不同類別金融資產和金融負債的程序，以及相關的內部控制。\n\n評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統相關的應用系統控制。\n\n取得關於財務資產及財務負債之評估、存在性、權利與義務，以及完整性的外部確認。\n\n當採用市場報價時，務必與獨立來源核實。\n\n使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性與假設的合理性，並驗證輸入數據的來源是否為獨立的。\n\n在使用未以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性，以及假設與輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產公允價值估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n本集團的投資物業按公允價值列賬，截至2019年12月31日總額為港幣224.81億元。本集團亦持有二十二間合營企業的權益，總額為港幣445.06億元，這些合營企業的主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由本集團直接持有或由合營企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的評估確定。 該等評估涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所用假設。\n\n投資性不動產公允價值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n取得並審閱本集團直接或透過合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值是根據估值報告中所載的估值。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性與資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法的適當性以及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資訊。 這些資訊涵蓋香港金融管理局2019年年度報告中的所有內容，但不包括財務報表及我對該財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見僅限於財務報表，並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我對此等資訊不提供任何形式的保證意見。\n\n就我對財務報表之審計而言，我的責任是閲讀其他資訊，並評估其是否與財務報表或我於審計過程中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或有任何重大失實之處。若根據我所執行之工作，我認為該等其他資訊存在重大失報，我須據實報告。就此，我無任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下審計小組對財務報表的職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，編製真實且公允的財務報表，並為此建立必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在重大歪曲，無論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並以持續經營為基礎進行會計處理。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組負責監管本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是就財務報表整體是否不存在因舞弊或錯誤所導致的重大錯報提供合理保證，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證係指高度的保證水準，但不能保證依照審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總能發現所有存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若其單獨或彙總效應可能合理預期會影響使用者基於此等財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計時，我會行使專業判斷，並於審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我：\n\n辨識並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述之風險，不論係因舞弊或錯誤所致；設計及執行相應之審計程序，並取得足夠及適切之審計證據，作為我提出意見之基礎。因舞弊所導致之重大錯誤陳述未被發現之風險，高於因錯誤所導致之風險，蓋因舞弊可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內控。\n\n為設計符合現況的審計程序，需瞭解與審計相關的內部控制，但此並非為評估該集團內部控制的有效性。\n\n評估貨幣當局所採用會計政策之適當性，以及其會計估計及相關披露之合理性。\n\n評估貨幣當局採用持續經營會計基準的恰當性，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，則有責任在審計報告中提請關注財務報表中的相關披露，或若該等披露不足，則應修改我的審計意見。我的結論基於截至審計報告日所取得的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營。\n\n評估財務報表之整體表達、結構及內容，包括相關揭露，並確認財務報表是否能以公允表達之方式，真實且公允地反映其所載列之相關交易及事件；並取得足夠及適當之審計證據，以對本集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我負責指導、監督及執行本集團審計，並對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我與匯換基金諮詢委員會的審計小組就審計的計劃範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，以及我在審計過程中識別出的重大內部控制缺陷等事宜進行匯報。\n\n我亦向匯兌基金諮詢委員會審計小組呈交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向彼等通報所有可能或然影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組的溝通事項，我確定本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，並將其視為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露相關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項可能造成的負面後果，合理預期將高於其對公眾利益的效益，否則我將在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n約翰·朱 審計總監\n\n審計署\n香港灣仔告士威道7號\n入境事務大樓26樓\n\n二零二零年四月三日\n"}
