{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","en":"# Stay vigilant and navigate the challenges ahead.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority navigated a complex and challenging global landscape. Throughout the year, regional military conflicts persisted, several nations held significant elections, and the global economic outlook remained clouded, contributing to ongoing global instability. However, policymakers worldwide sought to balance controlling rising inflation with supporting economic growth, fostering steady expansion in major economies. Furthermore, the United States’ first interest rate cut in four years, coupled with a series of supportive economic policies implemented in mainland China, boosted market sentiment. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\nFaced with a complex situation, our strategy is to further strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a leading hub for offshore RMB business, financial technology, and green and sustainable finance, thereby reinforcing its status as an international financial center. In 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) made significant progress in these key areas. The enthusiastic reception to events such as the annual International Financial Leaders Investment Summit demonstrates the international community’s strong confidence in Hong Kong’s future as a global financial hub.\n\nFacing cyclical adjustments and structural transformation in Hong Kong’s economy, we have worked closely with the banking sector to strengthen support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alleviating their repayment burdens in a high-interest rate environment and fostering their continued growth. Alongside various policy measures introduced by the Central Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Hong Kong’s economy has steadily recovered. In 2024, Hong Kong’s economy recorded modest growth of 2.5%.\n\nEntering 2025, the global economy will continue to face considerable uncertainty amid an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Rising trade protectionism and increased tariff barriers threaten to disrupt global supply chains and intensify geoeconomic fragmentation, adding to the instability of the global economic outlook. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could significantly impact both the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nFacing a complex and challenging economic and financial environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will remain vigilant and diligently fulfill its responsibilities to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and banking system, and to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. We will foster closer relationships with market participants, actively promote the development of emerging sectors, and ensure Hong Kong maintains its leading position in the global financial landscape.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System: A Bedrock Principle\n\nThe linked exchange rate system has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for over 40 years, successfully weathering multiple economic and interest rate cycles and demonstrating strong resilience.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding U.S. interest rate policy in 2024, the Hong Kong dollar market continued to function smoothly under the Linked Exchange Rate System. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, weakening slightly in the first four months due to liquidity tightening before gradually strengthening to approach the upper limit of the range by year-end. This stability reflects strong market confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System, which continues to receive high recognition from the International Monetary Fund and the international financial community.\n\nMarket confidence in the linked exchange rate system rests on our consistent efforts to clearly explain its workings and benefits to the public, coupled with diligent market oversight. We leverage detailed data collection, advanced data analytics, and artificial intelligence to enhance our timely and comprehensive assessment of both the market and financial stability.\n\n# Banking System: Maintaining Robustness Amid Multiple Challenges\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s banking system demonstrated strong resilience in the face of multiple macroeconomic challenges, maintaining ample capital and liquidity. By the end of 2024, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks reached 21.8%, exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. Liquidity also remained robust, with the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, well above the statutory minimum of 100%. The ratio of classified loans rose to 1.96% at year-end, influenced by persistently high interest rates, unresolved debt issues of some mainland Chinese property developers, and a weak local commercial real estate market. However, these risks remained generally manageable due to banks’ prudent credit risk management and adequate provisioning.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority adjusted its countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage loans twice in 2024, following close monitoring of banking credit risks, including those related to property mortgages, and in light of evolving property market conditions and banking system risks. Specifically, the maximum loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratio limits for all residential properties were raised back to the levels in place before the introduction of these measures in 2009.\n\nWhile continuously strengthening bank credit risk management, we are also committed to enhancing the operational and technological resilience of banks to address the new challenges arising from increased reliance on third-party service providers. The CrowdStrike global incident last July illustrates how operational disruptions in today’s interconnected world can have severe cascading effects. Although the impact on the Hong Kong banking sector was limited, it underscores the importance of robust frameworks to maintain critical operations even under severe stress. Encouragingly, all Hong Kong banks have established operational resilience frameworks and are now in the crucial phase of critical function mapping and scenario testing, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities to ensure business continuity.\n\nAt the same time, to address evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) prioritized strengthening the banking sector’s cybersecurity defenses last year, including issuing new guidelines and conducting thematic reviews. We also collaborated with other local financial regulators to advance the cross-industry cyber risk landscape mapping project, assessing systemic cyber risks arising from the relationships among financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, and technology service providers. Following a trial phase completed in 2024, the project will be fully implemented this year.\n\nAnother significant challenge posed by technological advancements is the escalating and increasingly sophisticated threat of financial fraud, requiring coordinated efforts from banks, regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies, and the public. We have instructed banks to further bolster their online banking security measures and monitoring systems. Last year, the Anti-Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Group also expanded its remit to encompass all major retail banks and six licensed stored-value facilities operators, substantially improving the efficiency and scope of information sharing and leading to increased seizures of criminal proceeds. Simultaneously, a consultation on legislative amendments to promote information sharing among banks has received broad support, and the resulting legislation will further strengthen banks’ capabilities in detecting and preventing financial crime.\n\nIn addition to the measures outlined above, raising public awareness of suspicious transactions and enhancing self-protection are equally important. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the “Suspicious Account Alert” mechanism and launched the “Consumer Anti-Fraud Charter 2.0,” bringing in more participating organizations to broaden its protective scope and further safeguard the public. Simultaneously, we introduced “Smart Deposit Protection,” allowing bank customers to allocate a portion of their funds to a protected account for added security.\n\nIn addition to the measures taken to help customers prevent fraud, we also addressed the risk of impulsive overborrowing. Last year, we required retail banks to provide a minimum seven-day cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, allowing customers to carefully consider their financial responsibilities and repayment ability after signing a loan agreement. At the same time, the “Xinzi Tong” personal data infrastructure project was successfully launched, marking significant progress in enhancing personal credit data services.\n\nBeyond our regulatory work, a key focus for 2024 is ensuring credit availability to support the real economy, which is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – a vital pillar of the Hong Kong economy. Last year, we jointly launched the “9+5” support measures with the banking sector – a package of nine initiatives by the government and five by the banking sector – to help SMEs access bank financing to meet their working capital needs and facilitate their upgrading and transformation. Banks have committed not to require mortgage customers who are making timely repayments to prepay their loans, nor to reduce credit lines solely based on a decline in collateral value. To date, over 39,000 SMEs have received credit support and new loan approvals, totaling HK$95 billion in credit facilities. Banks have also reserved approximately HK$390 billion in dedicated funds within their loan portfolios to support the continued development of SMEs in a changing market environment. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks jointly established a dedicated task force on SME financing to provide support to SMEs from both individual case and industry-wide perspectives. Given the current trade disputes and uncertain external economic outlook, we added three further support measures targeting specific industries in April 2025, further strengthening support for SMEs in multiple sectors. At the same time, we also launched two measures to support the overall economic development of Hong Kong.\n\nWe are continuously working to maintain the stability of the banking system and enhance its operational efficiency by promoting technology adoption in the banking sector and accelerating the use of financial technology. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have integrated fintech into their daily operations. Recognizing the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to strengthen risk management, prevent fraud, and improve customer experience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborated with Digital Hong Kong last year to launch the “GenAI Sandbox,” encouraging responsible application of GenAI by banks. We have also issued guidelines requiring banks to ensure robust customer protection when deploying GenAI in customer-facing services. Furthermore, the HKMA is actively leveraging GenAI internally to improve analytical and regulatory efficiency. Beyond GenAI, we are fostering collaboration and innovation within the fintech ecosystem through the new FiNETech series of events, the FintechConnect matching platform, and a range of cross-industry exchange activities.\n\n# Strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial center.\n\nHong Kong has maintained its leading position as an international financial center despite the challenges and uncertainties of 2024, and continues to enhance its influence in various fields.\n\nHong Kong plays a vital role as a bridge connecting Mainland China and international markets. By implementing supportive policies and strengthening collaboration with stakeholders, Hong Kong continuously strengthens its position as a regional hub for financial technology and sustainable finance. Please refer to the 2024 Sustainable Development Report for details on our work in green and sustainable finance.\n\n# The rapid growth of Renminbi business is driving deeper financial cooperation with mainland China.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s Renminbi (RMB) business continued to demonstrate strong momentum, with significant growth in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and particularly offshore bank lending. The RMB real-time gross settlement system reached a record high in daily transaction volume, totaling 3.1 trillion yuan, reflecting Hong Kong’s increasingly prominent role as a global offshore RMB hub.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to deepen financial connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland. The “Three Connect, Three Facilitate” policies launched in 2024, along with six new measures announced earlier this year, represent significant policy breakthroughs. Among these, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced a RMB 100 billion trade finance liquidity facility, providing banks with stable and cost-effective funding to expand RMB trade finance services and support the real economy. Another key development allows investors to use onshore bonds held through the Bond Connect Northbound program—particularly those issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks—as eligible collateral for the HKMA’s RMB liquidity facility, Hong Kong’s clearing houses, and offshore RMB bond repurchase operations. This innovation enhances the attractiveness of onshore bonds to offshore investors and promotes greater participation by global investors in the onshore bond market. We also launched “Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect 2.0” last year, featuring upgrades and optimizations including a more diversified range of investment products, more flexible sales and marketing arrangements, and expanded individual investment quotas. These measures not only consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a global offshore RMB business hub but also further strengthen its role as a vital gateway connecting the mainland and international markets.\n"}

The labor market remained stable, and inflation was contained at moderate levels as external price pressures eased. The stock market saw a significant recovery, while the property market remained weak, weighed down by sustained high interest rates and subdued market sentiment. Looking ahead to 2025, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment due to escalating trade tensions. However, China’s proactive economic stimulus measures, coupled with comprehensive support for local businesses, should help boost investor confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international cooperation and deepen regional collaboration.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remains robust, with ample capital and liquidity, and overall asset quality is sound.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding U.S. monetary policy, global growth prospects, and the geopolitical situation, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and money markets have continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened in the first four months of 2024, then strengthened for the rest of the year. As a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# The banking system is stable.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) promptly implemented measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises. It also maintained the stability of the banking system through risk-based supervision and contingency planning, and provided regulatory guidance to help the industry address emerging risks. These efforts strengthen the operational resilience and cyber resilience of banks. To promote the adoption of financial technology, the HKMA has launched a series of cross-industry initiatives, including the “Generative AI Sandbox.”\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched the “Consumer Protection Charter 2.0,” “SmartSafe Deposit,” and a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to strengthen consumer protection. In addition, the HKMA has issued guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services and is collaborating with the industry to provide an additional payment arrangement for second-hand property transactions. The HKMA has also issued guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimized the “Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect” pilot program, relaxed several restrictions on digital banks, and completed the full transition of personal credit data services to “Credit Information Link.” (Note: Please verify the official English name for “信資通”).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays a vital role in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Enhanced intelligence exchange and cooperation through public-private partnership platforms have led to a significant increase in suspicious transaction reports, enabling more effective confiscation of proceeds of crime. The consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate information sharing among banks received broad support and will further assist in detecting and preventing financial crimes. In addition, the Authority has issued guidance to banks on applying artificial intelligence to monitor suspicious activity and prevent authorized payment fraud, and has optimized the suspicious account alert mechanism.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. In addition, several aspects of the Deposit Protection Scheme have been enhanced to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to advance its work to establish a credible resolution process, implementing resolution standards that require banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to reduce the risk of disorderly early termination. Furthermore, the HKMA has made significant progress in developing banks’ preferred resolution strategies, overcoming challenges to resolvability, and enhancing their resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Hong Kong: An International Financial Center\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is collaborating with relevant authorities in Mainland China and Hong Kong to implement a series of measures to deepen and expand financial connectivity between Hong Kong and the Mainland. These include optimizing the “Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect”; expanding the range of eligible collateral for the HKMA’s Renminbi Liquidity Arrangement and “Northbound Swap Connect” transactions; and optimizing “Northbound Swap Connect.” These measures will help strengthen Hong Kong’s role as a gateway and consolidate its position as a global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a leading financial centre, with advancements in areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has enhanced its marketing outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, fostering a thorough understanding of the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it offers.

Meanwhile, following the announcement and implementation of economic stimulus measures in China, market sentiment in both China and Hong Kong has improved, and the government’s support measures should further boost Hong Kong’s tourism sector. Hong Kong’s financial system, built on years of stability and ample reserves, is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to strive for the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and infrastructure. Facing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we will remain vigilant, endeavoring to swiftly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, we will actively seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund prudently and flexibly. We will implement appropriate defensive measures, maintain high liquidity, and persistently diversify investments, striving to improve the long-term investment returns of the Exchange Fund and ensuring its continued effectiveness in maintaining Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Stable and Sound Financial System\n\nUnder the new U.S. administration, unpredictable policy directions and increasing geoeconomic fragmentation are expected to contribute to continued global economic uncertainty through 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system, will enhance its vigilance, proactively address potential risks, closely monitor developments, and stand ready to support the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Stay vigilant against potential risks.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, with the global macroeconomic environment remaining uncertain, volatility in global financial markets is likely. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, having developed substantial resilience and buffers over many years, is well-positioned to withstand potential challenges. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) possesses the ability, resources, and resolve to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor risks and uncertainties in both the local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. We will also assess issues impacting the Hong Kong economy and evaluate the potential risks they pose.\n\n# Maintaining banking system stability.\n\nThe uncertain macroeconomic environment is likely to pose challenges to the banking system. Simultaneously, the continued development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer numerous benefits but also introduce new operational and technological risks for banks.  In light of these developments, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will work to bolster banks’ resilience to various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, and maintaining close regulatory communication with individual banks and the industry as a whole.  Furthermore, we will continue to strengthen and refine the banking regulatory framework and supervisory approach in response to technological advancements, evolving customer expectations, and international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Priorities\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nGiven the pressures in the credit environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of banks and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management practices, with a particular focus on loan classification, provisioning, and problem loan management. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community, encouraging banks to continue supporting the economy while prioritizing prudent credit risk management.\n\nThe uncertain outlook for interest rates in major advanced economies, coupled with rising geopolitical tensions, is contributing to increased volatility in global financial markets. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to proactively manage market risk at authorized institutions. We will also assess how these institutions manage liquidity risk, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the increasing digitization of banking services, to bolster their ability to withstand sudden capital outflows.\n\n# Operational and Technological Risk\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue its work to enhance the overall operational resilience of the banking system, assessing banks’ progress in identifying potential risks to sustaining critical operations and taking remedial actions as part of its implementation of the operational resilience framework.\n\nGiven the increasing reliance of the banking industry on third-party service providers, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further strengthen banks’ management of third-party risks and issue new guidelines to implement the relevant international standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will assess systemic cyber risks through a cross-sectoral “Cyber Map” project. This project is being jointly advanced by the HKMA and other local financial regulators, following recommendations from the International Monetary Fund. Furthermore, the HKMA will review banks’ implementation of “robust triple data backup” arrangements and launch a cyber resilience testing framework to strengthen their ability to restore critical operations during severe cyber incidents.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the benefits of wider adoption of advanced technologies such as GenAI in the banking sector, we will remain vigilant regarding emerging risks and provide guidance on the use of these technologies as needed.\n\nWe will collaborate with industry stakeholders and relevant parties to proactively address emerging fraud threats and enhance the bank’s ability to combat digital fraud.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism\n\nIn 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce institutional reforms, innovations, and other measures to enhance Hong Kong’s overall capacity in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, mitigate the risks posed by illicit financial flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of the government’s interdepartmental collaboration, we will conduct a comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Hong Kong for the third time, to deepen our understanding of potential vulnerabilities arising from technological developments, and to formulate effective and proportionate guidelines based on the assessment results, in line with the implementation of the new regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including artificial intelligence, in areas that benefit the public. This includes enhancing the monitoring of suspicious activity, enabling banks to identify and prevent more fraud and shell accounts, and improving the quality of intelligence submitted to law enforcement agencies to support investigations.\n\nTo bolster the fight against fraud and other financial crimes, we will propose the necessary legislative amendments to establish a framework and safeguards for banks to share personal account information. To enhance the speed and scale of detecting illicit fund flows, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will commence work on a payment data analytics platform.\n\n# Wealth Management and Mandatory Provident Fund Services\n\nIn 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will conduct on-site and off-site reviews of authorized institutions regarding their conduct in securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related businesses. We will pay particular attention to high-yield complex products, digital assets and related investment products, the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, long-term insurance products, and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also closely coordinate with other regulatory authorities and the banking sector, providing guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investments, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products as needed. To promote the sustainable and responsible development of the digital asset industry, we will continue to collaborate with the government and other regulatory authorities to ensure a robust, comprehensive, and balanced regulatory framework is in place for the sector.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will facilitate the implementation of improvements to the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect scheme and continue to engage with industry stakeholders and relevant regulatory authorities to further refine the scheme and other related cross-border banking activities.\n\nWe will also refine existing guidelines for wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) services as needed, to help the industry better understand the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)’s regulatory requirements and ensure compliance.\n\n# Policy Formulation\n\n# Implementation of Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe final reforms to the Basel III Accord took effect in Hong Kong on January 1, 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to provide guidance to authorized institutions and clarify issues relating to the interpretation of the reforms, ensuring consistent adoption throughout the industry.\n\nThe Basel Committee issued new standards in December 2022 for banks’ prudential treatment of crypto-asset risks, followed by targeted revisions in July 2024 to further clarify the criteria for stablecoins to receive favorable regulatory treatment. Simultaneously, the Basel Committee published a document titled “Disclosure of Crypto-asset Risks,” outlining updated disclosure requirements for crypto-asset risk exposures. To implement these standards in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will study potential legislative amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules, Banking (Disclosure) Rules, Banking (Limits on Exposure) Rules (the “Exposure Limits Rules”), and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules. The HKMA will also propose several optimization suggestions to the Exposure Limits Rules based on implementation experience and industry feedback. The HKMA will launch a public consultation on the proposed amendments in the first half of 2025, with a view to implementing the new standards on January 1, 2026, in line with the Basel Committee’s timeline. The HKMA will also develop relevant banking reporting forms and supporting guidance to facilitate the implementation of the new standards by authorized institutions.\n\n# Additional Regulatory Policies and Risk Management Guidelines\n\nTo keep pace with the latest international standards, supervisory approaches, and developments in the banking industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to update several modules of its Regulatory Policy Manual, including CA-G-5 “Supervisory Review Process,” CA-B-2 “Systemically Important Banks,” IC-5 “Stress Testing,” IR-1 “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book,” and IC-3 “Requirements for Submission of Reports by Approved Auditors under the Banking Ordinance.” Module CR-G-13 “Counterparty Credit Risk Management” will be revised to reflect the sound practices outlined in the Basel Committee’s “Guidelines for Counterparty Credit Risk Management” issued in December 2024.\n\n# The Basel Committee's Key Principles for Effective Banking Supervision\n\nThe Basel Committee issued the revised Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (the Core Principles) in April 2024. The revised Core Principles reflect developments in regulation and supervision since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment in 2025 to ensure that its regulatory and supervisory framework aligns with the revised Core Principles.\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue an exposure draft on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will collaborate with other relevant authorities to study the impact of the proposed dynamic risk management accounting model on existing prudential regulatory requirements.\n\n# Law Enforcement\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority consulted the banking industry in 2024 on proposals to expand the investigative and enforcement powers of the Controller of Financial Services, to ensure he retains the necessary authority to effectively perform his functions under the Banking Ordinance. After considering the feedback received during the consultation, the HKMA will adjust the proposals and draft the necessary legislative amendments for further consultation with stakeholders.\n\n# Response Mechanism\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is continuing a multi-year project to establish a well-functioning resolution regime for recognized institutions. In 2025, the HKMA will prioritize the following areas of work (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: 2025 Management System Key Areas of Work\n\n# Handling Policies and Standards\n\nConsult on the chapter of the Practical Guidelines regarding the HKMA’s approach to valuation during restructuring, and the pre-existing capabilities and arrangements that authorized institutions must have to support timely and prudent valuations. Complete the relevant development work.\nAdvance the development of policy standards for restructuring.\n\n# International and Cross-border Cooperation\n\nWork on the development and implementation of international resolution policies, particularly the Financial Stability Board’s oversight of 12 resolution framework reforms scheduled for 2025 through its Resolution Mechanism Supervisory Group and associated working groups.\n"}

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Management Commissioner are prescribed in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. A letter of exchange dated June 25, 2003, between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Management Commissioner details the allocation of functions and responsibilities between them in respect of monetary and financial matters, and also discloses the delegation of certain powers by the Financial Secretary to the Financial Management Commissioner. This letter is a public document and can be accessed on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Fund must primarily be used to manage the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also use the Fund to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, while bearing in mind the Fund’s primary objective, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center.\n\nThe Financial Secretary for Exchange Fund is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in exercising the powers conferred upon him by that Ordinance, as well as performing other functions prescribed in other Ordinances and assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Secretary for Exchange Fund is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Financial Secretary for Exchange Fund serves as the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Commissioner of Banking regulates and supervises banking business and deposit-taking business under the powers conferred by the Banking Ordinance. The Ordinance tasks the Commissioner with matters relating to the licensing of Hong Kong-licensed banks, banks with restricted licenses, and deposit-taking companies.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance designates the Financial Institutions Authority as the resolution authority for financial institutions.

It is therefore committed to upholding high standards of corporate governance.\n\nTo uphold its commitment to sound institutional governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n\nEstablished a clear governance framework;\nEnsured high accountability and transparency, with regular engagement with stakeholders; and\nImplemented robust monitoring measures to manage risks and ensure compliance with required standards across all operations.\n\nThe governance framework of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority encompasses several key components, including statutory advisory committees providing advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, and internal controls with external audits.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the HKSAR Government\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (the HKSAR Government), but it may employ staff under terms of service different from those of civil servants to attract personnel with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officers. The HKMA’s day-to-day operations are highly autonomous within the scope of statutory powers conferred or delegated to the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for setting Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Financial Secretary stipulated that currency stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund System, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately HK$7.80 to 1 US dollar. The Chief Executive of the HKMA is responsible for achieving these monetary policy objectives, including determining the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and preserving its status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the duties of the Financial Secretary’s Delegate include:\n\nPromote the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system;\nCollaborate with relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;\nHandle matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender banknotes and coins;\nPromote the security and efficiency of financial infrastructure by developing payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and operating such systems as appropriate; and\nCollaborate with relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, and implement appropriate market development measures to strengthen Hong Kong’s international competitiveness in financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the ultimate control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Officer is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, acting under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Management Team\n\n# Advisory Committee\n\nThe Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s key areas of work.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to advise the Financial Secretary on matters relating to the exercise of control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex officio chairman of the Committee. Other members, including the Financial Management Commissioner, are appointed by the Financial Secretary in their individual capacities, with the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. These members are selected for their professional expertise and experience, which enhances the effectiveness of the Committee. The Committee has five sub-committees responsible for monitoring specific areas of work undertaken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and providing advice. These sub-committees report to and make recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. For details on the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and its five sub-committees, please refer to pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe Banking Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Deposit-Taking Companies provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on matters relating to the Banking Ordinance, particularly concerning the operation of banking business or deposit-taking business by banks, deposit-taking companies, and restricted license banks, as appropriate. Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary, and their membership includes the Commissioner of Financial Regulation and individuals appointed by the Financial Secretary with the Chief Executive’s authorization. Further details regarding the Banking Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Deposit-Taking Companies can be found on pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Senior Management\n\nThe Executive Committee comprises the Governor, Deputy Governors, and other senior officials of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), chaired by the Governor. The Committee convenes regularly to report to the Governor on the progress of key work across the HKMA’s departments and to provide advice on policy matters relating to the HKMA’s operations. Please refer to pages 66 to 67 for a list of the Committee’s members.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consistently maintains a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in implementing government policy objectives, alongside high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe official responsible for financial management appoints the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), making the HKMA accountable to the public through that official. Furthermore, as the HKMA’s powers are defined by legislation passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public for its actions through the Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibilities, including promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of public concern. In its daily operations and public engagement, the HKMA is committed to transparency and maintaining an open approach. This policy aims to:\n\nActively promote understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work within the financial sector and among the public, while respecting legal restrictions regarding the disclosure of confidential business information and maintaining market sensitivity; and remain aware of public opinion and respond to it appropriately.\n\n# Public Communication\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is dedicated to maintaining monetary and banking stability, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and overseeing a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and promoting economic development.\n\nTo effectively fulfill its duties, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must earn the public’s trust. Therefore, the HKMA is committed to transparently explaining its policies and operations. It maintains close communication with the media and leverages social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA also actively addresses issues of public concern that fall within its responsibilities, promptly clarifying misinformation and dispelling rumors regarding its policies through both traditional and social media channels.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has an information center with a library and an exhibition hall, open to the public six days a week for visits and use. For details on the HKMA’s public outreach efforts, please refer to the “Institutional Functions” section (pages 185 to 191).\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Chief Executive has committed to providing briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council three times a year on the HKMA’s activities and policies, and to answering related inquiries. These briefings are available on the HKMA website.\n\nIn addition, representatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s House Committee and its subcommittees from time to time to explain and discuss specific issues, and to assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Information Disclosure\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving international best practices in transparency and publishes a variety of journals and thematic publications in both Chinese and English. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections on economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as numerous publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing documents issued by the HKMA.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) periodically assesses the adequacy of disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and the Hong Kong Note Issuing Office’s accounts. The HKMA participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) program since 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Hong Kong Note Issuing Office system. Since 1996, the HKMA’s website has contained banking regulatory policies and guidance.\n\n# Internal Controls and External Audits\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs robust and effective monitoring mechanisms to ensure a high standard of employee integrity, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees’ ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the conduct of all employees at all levels adheres to established standards.\n\n# Internal Controls\n\n# Operational Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for identifying and assessing risks within their operational workflows and establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the stable daily operations of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\n# Organizational Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), is one of the cornerstones of the institution’s risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and reports on potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, assessing the adequacy of related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Internal Audit Department independently assesses whether the governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments are adequate and effective, and provides recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External Audit\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The Audit Office does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Annual Report.\n"}

The labor market remained resilient, and inflation stayed moderate with easing external price pressures. The stock market saw a significant recovery, while the property market remained weak, pressured by sustained high interest rates. Looking ahead to 2025, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment due to escalating trade tensions. However, China’s proactive economic stimulus measures, coupled with comprehensive support for local businesses, should help bolster business confidence. Hong Kong will also continue to strengthen international cooperation and deepen regional collaboration.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real economic activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy grew moderately in 2024. Real GDP increased by 2.5% year-on-year, following a 3.2% rise in 2023 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Externally, merchandise exports resumed growth, spurred by improving global demand and the recovery of the technology cycle, and became a key driver of overall economic expansion. Service exports also continued to rise, benefiting from the ongoing recovery of tourism and a significant increase in cross-border financial and fundraising activities in the second half of the year. However, this positive contribution was offset by a substantial increase in service imports, fueled by continued growth in outbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption softened as household spending patterns shifted. Conversely, increased property transactions and improved business confidence, supported by gradually easing monetary conditions, led to a slight increase in overall investment.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real GDP Growth\nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Category (Change from Previous Period)\nNote: The quarterly change in seasonally adjusted local fixed capital formation is not detailed.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nDespite the gradual increase in newly signed private residential rents, local cost pressures remained largely under control, and easing external price pressures contributed to moderate inflation in 2024 (Figure 2). For the full year, the underlying and overall inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nThe labor market remained stable in 2024, with the unemployment rate fluctuating between 2.9% and 3.1% throughout the year (Figure 3). Total employment gradually rose from the first quarter onwards, accompanied by an increase in the labor force, indicating a generally balanced level of labor demand and supply. Concurrently, nominal wages and labor income both experienced healthy growth as the economy continued to expand. Furthermore, the government announced improvements to Hong Kong’s talent attraction program in the 2024 Policy Address, aiming to alleviate workforce shortages across various industries and inject new impetus into the local population by attracting more young people.\n\nFigure 2: Core Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong’s stock market experienced a marked turnaround in 2024, building on a substantial rebound that began in mid-September. Specifically, improved investor confidence, spurred by interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve and proactive economic stimulus measures from China, drove the Hang Seng Index to a year-high of 23,100 points on October 7th (Figure 4). However, the U.S. presidential election in early November triggered market anxieties regarding the global economic outlook and the potential pace of Federal Reserve monetary easing, resulting in a slight pullback. Despite this, the Hang Seng Index closed the year at 20,060 points, a considerable 17.7% increase from the end of 2023, bringing a four-year period of decline to an end.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market was sluggish in the first three quarters of 2024 but showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter. Supported by policy relaxations in late February and mid-October, and the interest rate cut cycle that began in September, the annual volume of residential transactions increased significantly by 23.5%, rising from a historical low of 43,002 units in 2023 to 53,099 units in 2024. However, persistently high mortgage rates and accumulated inventory in the new housing market continued to put downward pressure on property prices. Consequently, property prices fell by 7.1% year-on-year in 2024, slightly improving housing affordability, although it remains constrained. The non-residential property market remained weak, with office vacancy rates remaining high despite ample supply, and retail properties facing challenges due to changing consumption patterns among tourists and local residents.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\nSource: Hong Kong Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# The Economic Environment\n\nHong Kong’s economy is forecast to face significant challenges in 2025 due to rising trade tensions and potential disruptions to international trade and capital flows. However, continued support from relevant authorities and the banking sector should strengthen the resilience of local businesses. Positive developments in China, including proactive economic stimulus measures and breakthroughs in advanced technology, are also expected to bolster business confidence. Simultaneously, Hong Kong will deepen regional cooperation and expand its ties with emerging markets. Furthermore, favorable tourism policies from the Chinese authorities, coupled with government initiatives to promote tourism, are projected to drive further growth in visitor arrivals.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2025. Rising housing rents will likely be reflected in consumer prices, creating some upward pressure on local costs. Despite increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook, external price pressures should remain contained. The labor market may face challenges due to escalating trade tensions. However, various talent attraction programs should help maintain a strong talent pool, supporting the long-term development of the economy.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2024, with banks maintaining ample capital and liquidity. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, credit risk faced by the banking system increased during the year, although the overall quality of bank assets remained manageable. Retail bank profits grew compared to 2023, benefiting from higher investment gains from trading portfolios and increased fee and commission income.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe non-performing loan ratio of the banking system rose from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 1.24% to 1.55% (Figure 5). This increase in the non-performing loan ratio was primarily due to downgrades in the credit ratings of some mainland China property developers, as well as local small and medium-sized developers and investors. However, the non-performing loan ratio for loans related to mainland China decreased from 2.58% to 2.38% over the same period. Banks maintained adequate provisions. As of the end of 2024, the loan loss provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of loan loss provisions to non-performing loans) was approximately 65%. After deducting the realizable value of collateral from non-performing loan balances, the adjusted loan loss provision coverage ratio was approximately 145%. Meanwhile, residential mortgage and credit card delinquency rates remained low, at 0.11% and 0.35%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Rates for Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nRetail banking's overall pre-tax operating profit increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the post-tax return on assets rose from 0.88% to 0.93% (Figure 7). Profit growth was primarily driven by gains from investments held for trading (+97.0%) and an increase in fee and commission income (+15.4%), partially offset by a decrease in net interest income (–5.2%). The retail banking net interest margin narrowed from 1.67% in 2023 to 1.52% in 2024 (Figure 8). Simultaneously, the cost-to-income ratio increased slightly from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banking\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Trends in the Balance Sheet\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet expanded by 4.3% in 2024, primarily due to a 13.4% increase in negotiable debt instruments. High borrowing costs suppressed loan demand, resulting in a 2.8% decrease in total loans for the year. Loans to Hong Kong decreased by 2.1%, while those to areas outside Hong Kong decreased by 5.7%. Trade financing increased by 4.6%, while loans to Mainland China decreased by 8.7% in 2024.\n\nIn the liabilities section of the balance sheet, total deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to 5.1% in 2023. As a result of decreased total loans and increased total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy ratio\n\nThe banking system remained strong in 2024. As of the end of 2024, the consolidated capital ratio of locally authorized institutions was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.9% (Figure 11). Both ratios were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 12: Aggregate Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Tier 1 institutions was 178.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Tier 2 institutions was 67.0% (Figure 13). Customer deposits remain the primary funding source for the banking system. At the end of 2024, the net stable funding ratio for Tier 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Tier 2A institutions were 143.4% and 186.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios significantly exceeded the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Authorized Institutions\nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 14: Capital Adequacy Ratios of Authorized Institutions\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n"}

The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened during the first four months of 2024 before strengthening for the rest of the year. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate generally tracks U.S. interest rates, while also being influenced by local supply and demand. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nHong Kong’s monetary policy aims to maintain currency stability by ensuring the Hong Kong dollar trades within a range of HK$7.75-7.85 per US$ in the foreign exchange market. This is achieved through a currency board system, where the Exchange Fund holds US dollar reserves that provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base. Any change in the monetary base necessitates a corresponding adjustment in the US dollar reserves to maintain this 100% backing.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) consists of:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);\n- Government-issued banknotes and coins;\n- Total balance of settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total balance); and\n- Exchange Fund notes and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to the linked exchange rate system. When the strong-side or weak-side convertibility undertaking is triggered, the HKMA, at banks’ request, will sell Hong Kong dollars for U.S. dollars, or buy Hong Kong dollars with U.S. dollars, at rates of HK$7.75 and HK$7.85 respectively. This adjusts the aggregate balance, causing Hong Kong dollar interest rates to fall or rise, and thereby encourages the exchange rate to return within the range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# Stable Exchange Rates\n\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar softened slightly as liquidity decreased. From late April to mid-May, the Hong Kong dollar strengthened, primarily supported by demand for dividend-related funds and active stock market trading. In early August, concerns about a potential U.S. economic recession and expectations of faster and more substantial interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve triggered the unwinding of carry trades and short positions in the Hong Kong dollar, pushing it to the upper limit of its permitted trading range. The Hong Kong dollar further strengthened in late September, benefiting from a surge in local stock market activity following a series of economic stimulus measures announced by mainland China. The Hong Kong dollar then weakened slightly in early November, partly due to a moderation in stock market gains and partly because strong U.S. economic performance gave the Federal Open Market Committee room to cautiously lower the federal funds rate. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded with year-end seasonal funding demand. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Figure 1).\n\n2024 Market Exchange Rate\n\nAs there was no triggering of the Exchange Fund guarantee during the year, the aggregate balance remained relatively stable, around HK$44.7 billion. Concurrently, the total outstanding amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds increased slightly from HK$1,245.5 billion to HK$1,383.9 billion. Consequently, the aggregate balance, combined with the total outstanding amount of these bills and bonds, rose from HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 to HK$1,428.7 billion at the end of 2024 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remains fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2024 Net Proceeds (Before Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nUnder the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally track U.S. interest rate movements, with short-term rates also influenced by local supply and demand. As market expectations for U.S. policy rate cuts grew throughout 2024, HIBOR generally declined during the first eight months (Figure 3). However, it rose in late September, driven by end-of-quarter seasonal funding needs and active stock market trading, briefly exceeding 6% at the end of the quarter. Subsequently, HIBOR stabilized and then increased towards year-end due to reduced liquidity. For the full year, overnight, one-month, and three-month HIBOR fell by 45, 69, and 78 basis points respectively, closing at 5.65%, 4.58%, and 4.37%.\n\nIn response to a reduction in the U.S. Federal Funds rate target range, the benchmark interest rate was lowered three times, totaling 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point), falling from 5.75% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, following the U.S. policy rate cuts, several banks reduced their prime lending rates by 25 basis points in mid-September, and further reduced them by 25 basis points in early November and 12.5 basis points in late December. Consequently, the average interest rate on new mortgage loans also fell from 4.13% in 2023 to 3.59% in December 2024. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to function normally. Lending through the discount window increased from HK$38.8 billion in 2023 to HK$50 billion in 2024; its usage showed no unusual activity.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) – 2024\n\n# System of Linked Exchange Rates\n\nSince 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a crucial pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating strong resilience in the face of challenges. Despite uncertainties regarding U.S. policy interest rates and geoeconomic fragmentation, the Hong Kong dollar’s foreign exchange and money markets have maintained orderly operations, reflecting the system’s robustness and effectiveness. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated in its 2024 External Sector Report that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and prudent fiscal frameworks, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system is crucial for the proper functioning of the linked exchange rate system. The Hong Kong banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions that are very ample by international standards. To ensure the banking system’s resilience to shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely monitors banks’ credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintains regulatory supervision of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s accounts, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to support the monetary base since October 1998. The support ratio – that is, the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base – rose from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a high of 112.65% on September 10, 2024, exceeding the trigger upper limit of 112.5% (Figure 4). This increase was primarily attributable to interest income from investments and the revaluation of investments at market prices.  Following arrangements approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, assets were transferred from the support portfolio to the investment portfolio, reducing the support ratio to approximately 110.08% on September 11. The support ratio subsequently remained relatively stable, closing at 109.56% on December 31. Under the linked exchange rate system, while certain Exchange Fund assets are designated as the support portfolio, the entire asset base of the Exchange Fund can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources, coupled with Hong Kong’s sound banking system, provide a strong backing for maintaining monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of Support Ratio in 2024\n\n# Monetary Policy Committee\n\nThe Exchange Rate Stability Committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining issues relating to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. In 2024, the Committee’s areas of focus included the risk-bearing by Hong Kong banks with respect to non-bank financial institutions, and the latest monetary policy implementation frameworks of major advanced economies. The minutes of the Committee’s meetings and the reports on the operation of the monetary system submitted by the HKMA are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nFigure 5: Banknote Circulation Amount by Issuing Bank as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Banknotes in Circulation as of the End of 2024\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2024\n\nFigure 8: Value of Banknotes and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government at the End of 2024.\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Government-Issued Circulating Banknotes and Coins by the End of 2024.\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 14 talks this year on the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting over 2,600 participants, including bank tellers, retail cashiers, and students. This initiative improved their ability to recognize genuine currency.\n\n# Coin Collection Plan\n\nThe coin collection program continues to be popular with the public. Details of the program can be found in the chapter \"The HKMA and Sustainable Development\" of the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# USD Liquidity Arrangement\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced enhancements to its USD liquidity arrangement, including shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This standing arrangement provides backup liquidity to licensed banks as needed, particularly with the United States’ implementation of a T+1 settlement cycle on May 28.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Securities and Bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds Programme continued to operate smoothly. As of the end of 2024, the outstanding nominal value of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds totalled approximately HK$1,306.8 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Monetary Studies\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Centre for Monetary and Financial Research, affiliated with the School of Finance, published 15 research papers on monetary and financial issues of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Centre shared its research findings with a global audience through five open-access electronic journals.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩銀行客戶的資金流壓力\n\n# 支持本地中小企\n\n中小企是香港經濟的重要基石，金管局一直密切關注它們獲取銀行融資的情況。自金管局與銀行業於2019年成立「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」（中小企協調機制）以來，合共推出多輪中小企支援措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，協助中小企渡過新冠疫情期間的困境。\n\n在2024年，金管局與銀行業推出更多措施，支持經營情況因經濟轉型而仍然面對挑戰的中小企，並協助中小企持續發展和升級轉型。\n\n# 新的中小企支持措施\n\n金管局透過中小企協調機制於3月推出九項措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資，以及支持其持續發展。\n\n於3月公布的九項支持中小企措施\n\n1. 不要求按時供款按揭客戶提前還款\n2. 調整信貸額度給予客戶最少六個月過渡期\n","en":"# The banking system is stable.\n\nDespite macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2024. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly implemented measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises and ensure banking system stability through risk-based regulation and contingency planning. The HKMA also provided regulatory guidance and supported the industry in addressing emerging risks, thereby enhancing operational stability and cybersecurity. To encourage fintech adoption, the HKMA launched a series of cross-industry initiatives, including a generative artificial intelligence “sandbox.”\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched the Consumer Protection Pledge 2.0 to strengthen consumer protection in banking. It has also introduced “SmartSafe Deposit” to help depositors effectively safeguard their deposits, and implemented a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to reduce the risks of impulsive and excessive borrowing. In addition, the HKMA has issued guidance to banks on the application of generative artificial intelligence in customer-facing services and is collaborating closely with the industry to provide an additional payment arrangement for second-hand property transactions. The HKMA is also enhancing customer experience and ensuring investor protection by issuing guidelines on digital asset-related activities, optimizing the “Cross-border Wealth Management Connect” pilot program, and streamlining the sales procedures for investment and insurance products. The full transition of personal credit data services to the Hong Kong Credit Reference Agency (HKCRA) will be completed this year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a vital role in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. By enhancing the speed and volume of intelligence exchanged through the Anti-Deception and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group, intelligence-led suspicious transaction reports increased by 303% compared to 2023, leading to a 34% rise in the freezing or confiscation of proceeds of crime. Consultation on legislative amendments to facilitate information sharing among banks to assist in the detection and prevention of financial crime received broad support. In April, the HKMA issued guidance based on the findings of a thematic review of transaction monitoring systems, and in September launched a program to promote industry application of artificial intelligence for monitoring suspicious activity. The HKMA also collaborated with the banking sector and the Hong Kong Police Force to optimize the “Suspicious Account Alert” mechanism and strengthen publicity efforts, and issued guidance to banks on preventing, detecting, and stopping authorized payment fraud.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Authority has enhanced various aspects of the deposit protection scheme to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nTo ensure the credibility of the resolution mechanism, the HKMA has implemented resolution standards, requiring banks to update their financial contracts with counterparties to mitigate the risk of early termination. Furthermore, the HKMA has made substantial progress in defining banks’ preferred resolution strategies, addressing challenges to resolvability, and ensuring sufficient financial resources and operational continuity, as well as enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority aims to foster the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this requires building and sustaining a financial system with a high degree of resilience, capable of providing the essential financial services to support Hong Kong’s economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the financial system through their operational methods, or even, in extreme cases, through disorderly insolvency. As the financial regulator, the Financial Administrator plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring banks have the capacity to withstand shocks and respond to crises, ultimately helping to prevent insolvency. The Financial Administrator is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and the authorization of licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as “authorized institutions”).\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory system is not designed to eliminate risk. Rather, as the resolution authority, the Financial Secretary aims to ensure that, should an authorized institution become non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, with the Financial Secretary serving as the resolution authority for authorized institutions. Implementing this mechanism requires developing resolution rules and policy standards, conducting resolution planning to address obstacles to effective resolution, and building the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s operational capacity to manage failing authorized institutions. To ensure effective implementation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts approaches consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures. The HKMA’s oversight aims to promote the overall safety and efficiency of these infrastructures, reduce systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Strengthening their ability to withstand financial crises safeguards Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, preventing disruptions that could compromise its stability.\n\n# 2024 in Review\n\n# Licensing Matters\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority granted banking licenses to one bank established in Hong Kong and another outside the territory this year. It also approved a dealer broker based outside Hong Kong to operate as a money broker. Furthermore, the HKMA revoked the licenses of three licensed banks, one bank with a restricted license, and one deposit-taking company.\n\nFor further information on recognized institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to Appendices and Tables D to F on pages 311–314 and 320–323.\n\n# Review of the Three-Tier Banking System\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed its public consultation on simplifying the three-tier banking system to a two-tier system. Respondents generally supported the proposed simplification. After considering the feedback received, the HKMA proposed several key considerations to streamline the transition process and minimize the impact on existing customers of deposit-taking companies.\n\n# Virtual bank rebrands.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed a public consultation regarding the renaming of virtual banks to digital banks. The renaming proposal received widespread support, and the Authority subsequently revised the statutory guideline on the recognition of digital banks in October, with the changes taking effect.\n\n# Assessment of Digital Banks\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed a comprehensive review of digital banks in 2024, with the report published in August. The review found that digital banks have achieved the three policy objectives for their introduction in Hong Kong: promoting financial technology and innovation, providing new customer experiences, and fostering financial inclusion. Given the diversified development of both digital and traditional banks, the HKMA believes the current number of digital bank licenses is appropriate and sees no need to introduce further participants into the market at this stage. The revised Guideline on Authorization of Digital Banks, issued in October, relaxed several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to conduct banking business beyond retail banking and to establish physical branches where reasonable from the perspectives of customer experience and business strategy, provided they continue to primarily offer banking services through digital channels.\n\n# Review of Banking Licensing Fees\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed its review of licensing fees during the year and increased the fee levels in June.\n\n# Hong Kong Company Registration Transfer\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides support to the government regarding the introduction of a company re-domiciliation regime, including assisting with the legislative process for amending the Banking Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, as well as other relevant legislation.\n\n# Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted 174 off-site reviews covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, and risk management. To further strengthen risk governance standards, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of authorized institutions, and participated in 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Additionally, the HKMA conducted on-site reviews of authorized institutions’ business operations, focusing on governance and practices related to credit, market, and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the increasing adoption of technology by recognized institutions, operational and technology risk management are key regulatory priorities. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has further strengthened its oversight of climate risk management at these institutions to bolster their resilience to climate change. The HKMA’s work in maintaining financial stability and promoting robust economic growth amidst global economic uncertainty has been widely recognized, earning it the title of “Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific” from *The Asian Banker* magazine.\n\nMs. Zhu Liqiao, Assistant Managing Director (Banking Supervision), representing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, received the “Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Agency Award” presented by The Asian Banker magazine.\n\nRegarding regulatory oversight, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducts on-site inspections of authorized institutions’ business relating to securities, investment products, trusts, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) schemes, as well as consumer protection matters. These inspections are complemented by thematic assessments to review new projects or areas identified as posing a higher risk.\n\nTable 1 presents an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)’s regulatory work in 2024.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\nAdditional regulatory work focused on operational resilience includes an HKMA review and requiring authorized institutions to conduct self-assessments to examine implementation progress and identify areas for improvement, as well as extensive outreach to the industry at both bilateral and broader levels regarding frameworks and practices. Furthermore, regulatory efforts concentrate on assessing authorized institutions’ strategies and approaches for approving and managing ongoing risks associated with specific loan portfolios, such as those for commercial properties and small and medium-sized enterprises. This includes holding consultation meetings with authorized institutions to review their implementation of the HKMA’s Regulatory Policy Manual, Module GS-1 on “Climate Risk Management.”\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe total loan amount decreased by 2.8% in 2024, compared to a 3.6% decrease in 2023. Table 2 details the growth rates of various types of loans and advances. Total loans pertaining to the Mainland decreased by 8.7% to HKD 385.9 billion in 2024 (Table 3).\n\nGiven persistently high interest rates, the unresolved debt issues of some mainland property developers, and the weakness in the local commercial property market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess their credit risk management practices in 2024. The banking system’s asset quality continued to face pressure throughout the year, but the risk situation remained manageable. The specific classification loan ratio for the banking system rose from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the corresponding ratio for related loans in mainland China decreased from 2.58% to 2.38% over the same period.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic review to examine the credit risk management of authorized institutions.

These include optimizing the Greater Bay Area Wealth Management Connect; expanding the eligible collateral for the HKMA’s Renminbi Liquidity Facility and the Northbound Swap Connect; enhancing the Northbound Swap Connect; and refining the primary liquidity provider arrangement. These measures will help strengthen Hong Kong’s role as a gateway and consolidate its position as a global offshore Renminbi business hub.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made significant progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centers. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has intensified its marketing efforts targeting overseas and Mainland China stakeholders, helping them to fully appreciate the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it offers. The successful hosting of the third “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit” and other major events not only enhanced Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial center but also generated a positive impact. The HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulators, continuing to contribute to global initiatives to maintain financial stability and promote financial market development.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress across various areas of its “FinTech 2025” strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure.\n\nThe number of registrations and transaction volume for the Faster Payment System (轉數快) continue to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations by the end of 2024, with the average daily processing of Hong Kong dollar instant transactions increasing to 1.65 million. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working closely with the People's Bank of China to advance the interoperability between Hong Kong’s FPS and the mainland’s online payment clearing system, enabling cross-border payments.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued its commitment to strengthening Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has expanded and optimized the connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the Mainland, reinforcing Hong Kong’s role as a bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. Several optimization measures related to the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect under the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) were introduced this year, facilitating cross-border investment for individual investors in the GBA. In February, the HKMA included onshore Chinese government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China and policy financial bonds issued by Mainland policy banks in the list of eligible collateral under the RMB Liquidity Arrangement. In July, relevant authorities on both sides announced further support for overseas investors to use onshore bonds held through Bond Connect as collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions, to be implemented in January 2025. Additionally, Northbound Swap Connect was optimized during the year, enhancing investors’ flexibility and efficiency in hedging strategies and portfolio management.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s offshore RMB business experienced steady growth. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced optimized measures for the Tier 1 liquidity providing arrangement, including increasing the number of participating institutions and expanding the arrangement’s scale. By year-end, the overnight cross-border service capacity of the Hong Kong RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement System was enhanced to better meet global demand for cross-border RMB payments.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced measures to benefit citizens and businesses under the Greater Bay Area financial cooperation framework, including a pilot program for cross-border credit information exchange to facilitate corporate financing, and cross-border remittance arrangements to facilitate property purchases by Hong Kong residents in the Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To strengthen the city’s appeal as a preferred fund management center and a hub for family office business, the HKMA is collaborating closely with the government and the financial sector to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. Furthermore, through the Evergreen project, the HKMA issued a second batch of tokenized bonds and launched EvergreenHub, a one-stop digital bond knowledge base, and the Digital Bond Funding Program, continuing to drive innovation in the Hong Kong bond market. In October, the HKMA announced the “Sustainable Finance Action Plan,” outlining specific goals to further consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance.\n\nOn another front, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to strengthen its market development efforts, promoting Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders. In November, the HKMA hosted the third “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit.” The three-day summit, themed “Sailing Forward in Times of Change,” brought together leading figures from the global financial industry to share their unique insights. The summit opened with a keynote speech by Vice Premier He Lifeng of the State Council, followed by a session featuring presentations from three mainland financial regulatory bodies and panel discussions with international financial leaders. The summit assembled over 350 leaders from more than 120 international financial institutions, clearly reflecting the international financial community’s support for and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority also held a number of other seminars and meetings during the year, including:\n\nIn September, a Joint Climate Finance Conference was co-hosted with the Dubai Financial Services Authority; in October, the 15th Global Risk Forum was co-hosted with the Global Association of Risk Professionals, and an International Financial Symposium was also co-hosted with the Bank for International Settlements. Furthermore, in December, the Financial Stability Board Plenary Meeting was held – the first such meeting in Asia since 2016 – bringing together leaders and senior officials from over 50 financial authorities and 12 international standard-setting organizations.\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively strengthened its bilateral ties with other regions. In December, the HKMA held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in Hong Kong, fostering investment and financial market linkages between the Middle East and Asia. The HKMA signed a memorandum of understanding with the UAE Central Bank to establish interoperability between the two jurisdictions’ debt capital market infrastructures and facilitate cross-border debt securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, in October, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, to enhance cooperation in the financial services sector.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority held the seventh Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Cooperation Dialogue in December, covering regional and local outlooks and policy challenges, as well as the latest developments and potential areas for cooperation in sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority visited Thailand and Malaysia in January and May, meeting with central banks, financial institutions, and businesses to promote Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center and further strengthen bilateral financial links and cooperation. A key area of focus was promoting the use of RMB and local currencies for cross-border investment and trade settlement, as well as highlighting Hong Kong’s competitive advantages.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking affairs internationally and continues to play a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Regional Consultative Group for Asia under the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and also as co-chair of the FSB’s Financial Innovation Network (until July 2024). The HKMA also chairs the Group of Central Bank Governors of Major Emerging Market Economies under the Bank for International Settlements and the Peer Review Group on Crypto-asset Frameworks under the FSB. From 2018 to 2024, the HKMA served continuously as chair of the Financial Market Work Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Promotion Office and various banking departments continue to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech by the industry and enhancing Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s fintech hub. Key initiatives to be rolled out this year include:\n\nFurther promote the application of financial technology in banks across five key areas: wealthtech, insurtech, green technology, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technology.\nAdvance work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) to understand its benefits and potential applications, including:\n*   Progressing the mBridge project – a multi-central bank digital currency cross-border network – to improve cross-border payments;\n*   Further studying the feasibility of issuing a digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD); and\n*   Beginning to explore the use of CBDC to support the development of a tokenized market in Hong Kong.\nFacilitate lending to small and medium-sized enterprises through a commercial data platform;\nStrengthen cross-border fintech cooperation; and\nPromote wider adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS).\n\nThe use of Faster Payment System (FPS) continued to increase in 2024, with registration numbers and transaction volumes steadily rising over the past six years. As of the end of 2024, FPS registrations reached 15.8 million, a 33% increase in the average daily transaction volume compared to the previous year. Beyond growth in person-to-person and business payments, the increasing use of FPS to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up e-wallets or bank accounts has been a primary driver of this sustained growth.\n\nTo ensure the security and efficiency of local retail payment services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees six designated retail payment systems and regulates 15 licensed stored value facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”). Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to work closely with the industry to strengthen control measures and enhance consumer protection in response to increasing fraud risks.\n\nThe Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) completed a two-month public consultation in February regarding proposed legislation for regulating stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong. They jointly published a consultation summary in July and submitted the Stablecoin Ordinance to the Legislative Council for review in December. To gain a better understanding of stablecoin issuers’ business models and develop appropriate regulatory arrangements, the HKMA also launched a regulatory sandbox for them, announcing three participating institutions in July. Simultaneously, the HKMA continues to actively participate in international organizations’ work on digital asset-related issues – including stablecoins and tokenization – to ensure the regulatory framework aligns with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority: Measures to Strengthen Hong Kong’s Competitiveness as an International Financial Centre in 2024\n\nDeepening connectivity between Hong Kong and Mainland China’s financial markets will consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an offshore RMB hub and strengthen ties within the Greater Bay Area.\n\nOptimize the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" and the \"Northbound Swap Connect.\"\nExpand the eligible collateral for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s RMB liquidity arrangements and the “Northbound Swap Connect” to include onshore RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of China and mainland policy banks.\nOptimize the primary liquidity provider arrangements.\nEnhance the nighttime cross-border service capabilities of Hong Kong’s RMB real-time gross settlement system to better meet global demand for cross-border RMB payments.\nSupport the issuance of dim sum bonds in Hong Kong by the Shenzhen Municipal Government, the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Hainan Provincial Government.\nFacilitate cross-border financing for enterprises through cross-border credit information cooperation.\nImplement streamlined cross-border remittance procedures for property purchases in the Greater Bay Area.\nDeepen exchanges and communication between mainland-related institutions and the Hong Kong financial sector to explore business opportunities.\n\n# Strengthening Connections Worldwide\n\nHost a series of international events, including the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit, the Financial Stability Board plenary meeting, and a seminar co-hosted with the Bank for International Settlements.\nStrengthen market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland China counterparts, and build a strong foundation for cooperation with the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nActively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organizations.\n\n# Enhancing the Competitiveness of Financial Platforms\n\nThe Evergreen Project is driving innovation in the bond market by assisting the government in issuing the world’s first multi-currency digital bonds, launching the one-stop digital bond knowledge hub “EvergreenHub,” and introducing the “Digital Bond Funding Scheme.”\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2024年）\n","en":"# Reserve Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed well in 2024. Major economies recorded stable growth, and inflation fell to levels closer to policy targets. Several major central banks gradually lowered policy interest rates, creating a favorable investment environment. For the full year of 2024, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with an investment return rate of 5.2%.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, directly or indirectly. It may also be used to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, thereby supporting Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the application and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated to it by the Financial Secretary and any further delegation of those powers.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Composition\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee defines the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) Preserve capital;\n(ii) Ensure the monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(iii) Maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Optimize investment returns while ensuring the above conditions (i) to (iii) are met, to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe objectives are fully aligned with the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Exchange Fund Investment Portfolio Categories\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing complete backing for the monetary base in accordance with the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of economies that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the aim of preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is prudently and gradually diversifying the asset allocation of part of the Exchange Fund into a wider range of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held within the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held within the long-term growth portfolio. The target asset allocation for the long-term growth portfolio, along with allocations to other asset classes, is established based on prudent risk management principles and a diversified investment strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased for the Exchange Fund’s strategic purposes. Due to the portfolio’s unique nature, its performance is not included in the Exchange Fund’s performance assessment.\n\n# Deposits with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies from time to time, with interest rates generally tied to the performance of its investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a key example where deposit rates are based on the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, depending on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the target asset allocation for the Future Fund is approximately 35:65 between these two portfolios.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is defined by an investment benchmark, representing the Fund’s long-term asset allocation to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses this strategic allocation as a guide and employs tactical asset allocation to seek returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark (i.e., the strategic allocation), and this difference is termed “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, establishes the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can then manage positions within this range to capitalize on short-term market movements.\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. Staff of the office directly manage approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including a core supporting portfolio and other investment portfolios. This internally managed portion includes investments in global fixed-income markets and implements the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through various derivative instruments.\n\n# Contract Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialized asset types. The purpose of engaging these external managers is to harness leading professional investment expertise to generate sustainable returns for the Fund, and to benefit from diversified and complementary investment strategies, as well as their valuable market insights and specialized knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes, and these expenses vary annually due to market factors.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe increasingly complex investment environment underscores the importance of robust risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, alongside rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. It employs a three-line-of-defense framework for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors key investment risk categories – including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks – and has implemented risk management procedures to provide a sound framework for strategic planning and diversified investment.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that emphasizing responsible investment and the sustainable long-term performance of investments can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives and reduce risks related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors associated with investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the Exchange Fund’s investment management process, guided by the principle that ESG investments will generally be prioritized when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment options. Further details of the HKMA’s work in responsible investment can be found in the “Responsible Investment” chapter of the 2024 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# Exchange Fund Performance\n\n# Financial Markets 2024\n\nGlobal financial markets performed largely well in 2024.\n\nMajor stock markets saw significant gains in 2024, with the U.S. market particularly strong in the first three quarters, fueled by a generally positive economic outlook, stable inflation, and an AI surge. However, market conditions became volatile in the fourth quarter due to concerns about rising inflation and increasing bond yields, leading investors to adopt a more cautious stance. In mainland China and Hong Kong, investor confidence improved in the third quarter following a series of economic and market stimulus measures introduced by Beijing. Nevertheless, with ongoing ambiguity surrounding real economic growth, both markets declined in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe global bond market experienced significant volatility in 2024. Although major central banks largely signaled a direction toward interest rate cuts, the pace and extent of these cuts shifted multiple times throughout the year. By the fourth quarter, the market began closely monitoring U.S. fiscal policy for 2025, leading to a substantial rise in U.S. Treasury yields and a decline in bond prices.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, driven by the interest rate outlook and a robust US economy.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, the bond market, and the stock market in 2024.\n\n# Exchange Fund Performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion in 2024, comprising:\n\nBond investments yielded HK$135.9 billion;\nequity investments yielded HK$90.9 billion (HK$21.8 billion from Hong Kong equities and HK$69.1 billion from other equities);\nnon-Hong Kong dollar assets decreased in foreign exchange valuation by HK$35.6 billion; and\nother investment income held by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund Investment Office amounted to HK$27.6 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the strategic asset portfolio generated valuation gains of HK$2.8 billion.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 408.1 billion. The total market value of the long-term growth portfolio investments was HKD 54.12 billion, including HKD 43.48 billion in private equity and HKD 10.64 billion in real estate. The portfolio had commitments totaling HKD 28.86 billion that had not yet been drawn down for investment.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding strategic asset portfolios) generated a 5.2% investment return in 2024, with its investment portfolio contributing 7.2% and supporting assets 4.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has yielded an annualized internal rate of return of 11.2% since its investments began in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 displays the investment returns for 2024 and the average returns over different periods. The Exchange Fund’s average returns were 2.0% from 2022 to 2024, 3.1% from 2020 to 2024, 3.1% from 2015 to 2024, and 4.5% since 1994.

意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2024年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及37.1。\n\n於2024年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共 39,151.17 億港元，金融負債共 13,862.99 億港元。\n\n86%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘14%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共5,522.51億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金 融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2024年12月31日共值211.32億港元。集團亦於聯營公司及合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2024年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告會計準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n\n-計劃並執行集團審計，以就集團中實體或業務單位的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，作為對財務報表形成意見的基礎。我負責指導、監督和審視為進行集團審計而履行的審計工作。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n#

Exchange Fund\n\nAuditor General's Report\nFinancial Statements of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Office\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) listed on pages 209 to 309, which comprise the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2024, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, together with the notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies.\n\nI am of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2024, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directives issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of Opinions\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, in my professional judgment, are most significant to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. I addressed these matters during the audit and in forming my opinion on the financial statements as a whole, but I do not express a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Fair Value Accounting – Valuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n\nNotes to the financial statements 2.5, 2.6, and 37.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value totaled HK$391.51 billion, and financial liabilities amounted to HK$138.63 billion.\n\n86% of these financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation techniques based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 14% of these financial assets was estimated using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets totaled HKD 5,522.51 billion, primarily including unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\nUnderstand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, and the associated monitoring measures.\n\nAssess and test monitoring of applications within computer systems.\n\nObtain written representations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nIf market prices are used, verify them with independent sources.\n\nIf the valuation method’s parameters are based on observable market data, evaluate the suitability of the method and the reasonableness of its underlying assumptions, and verify the parameters using independent sources.\n\nIf the valuation method’s parameters are not based on observable market data, evaluate the method’s suitability and the reasonableness of its underlying assumptions.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Property Carried at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 17, and 18 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value, totaling HK$21.132 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Group also has equity interests in associates and joint ventures primarily engaged in the ownership of overseas investment properties. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or through its associates and joint ventures, is primarily determined from independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgment and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of investment properties accounted for at fair value involve:\n\nObtain and review valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by its associates and joint ventures, and verify that fair value is determined in accordance with the valuation basis set out in the relevant reports.\n\nAssess the independence and qualifications of the valuer.\n\nAssess whether the valuation methods are suitable, and whether the underlying assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for supplementary information within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2024 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other information, and I offer no assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nAs an auditor, I have a responsibility to read other information to consider whether it contains any material inconsistencies with the financial statements or information obtained during the audit, or appears to be materially misstated. Based on my work, if I believe other data contains a material misstatement, I am required to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee within the framework of the Commissioner of Financial Management and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls they deem necessary to ensure the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Financial Manager is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing related matters where applicable, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditors’ Responsibility in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will detect all material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if they, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably be expected to affect the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nWhen auditing in accordance with the Audit Commission’s standards, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for your opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those due to error.\n\nUnderstand and assess internal controls related to auditing to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls.\n\nEvaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures are reasonable.\n\nAssess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether a material uncertainty exists that casts significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention to related disclosures in the financial statements in my auditor’s report. If those disclosures are inadequate, I must issue a qualified or adverse opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence available to me as of the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease operating as a going concern.\n\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether they faithfully present transactions and events.\n\nPlan and execute group audits to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business units within the group, as the basis for forming an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and reviewing the audit work conducted to complete the group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will report to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and timing, as well as significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Review Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have met the relevant ethical requirements concerning independence, and communicating to them any interests and other matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, along with any related safeguards where appropriate.\n\nI determine which matters arising from discussions with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements and, consequently, constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in my auditor’s report, unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit disclosure, or, in extremely rare circumstances, I conclude that the adverse consequences of disclosure would outweigh the public interest.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts are expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars.\n\n# Main Businesses\n\nThe Financial Management Officer manages the Exchange Fund (the Fund) under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary, in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66). The Fund’s primary objectives are to defend the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system.\n\nThe fund's assets are managed in four distinct portfolios: the Support Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Asset Portfolio. Under Hong Kong's currency board system, the assets of the Support Portfolio are fully matched with the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio mainly invests in the bond and stock markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), purchased by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government for strategic purposes and recorded in the fund’s accounts. Operating segment information is presented in Note 31.\n"}
