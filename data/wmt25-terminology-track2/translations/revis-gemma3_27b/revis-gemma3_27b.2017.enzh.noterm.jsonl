{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","zh":"# 行政長官的聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟與金融市場表現優於預期：實體經濟穩步增長；通貨膨脹維持低位；美國聯邦儲備系統當年三次升息及縮減資產負債表，並未引發新興市場經濟體的資金外流或美元走強。在樂觀市場情緒的推動下，全球股市持續上漲，包括美國三大股指均屢創新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲34%。恆生指數在2017年上漲近8,000點（或36%），並於2018年1月突破30,000點關卡，創下歷史新高。\n\n在如此有利的環境下，許多投資者充滿樂觀，甚至喜見欣榮。然而，這種情況持續至今年二月初，當時最新數據顯示美國工資增長高於預期，促使投資者重新檢視通脹風險，並引發全球股市顯著回調。二月第二週，道瓊斯指數兩日內下跌超過1,000點，恆生指數同週亦下跌超過3,000點。美國10年期國債收益率一度攀升至2.95%。資金流向的快速反轉顯示，市場創下紀錄高點的估值並非建立在穩固的基礎之上。這也提醒我們，香港必須擁有健全且穩健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動及資本外流所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 銀行體系韌性因預防措施而提升。\n\n正如俗語所說：「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局於二零一七年實施進一步的風險減輕措施，以維護香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。五月，我們推出針對銀行按揭貸款的第八輪逆周期措施，並加強銀行向物業發展商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系應對物業市場下行風險的能力。經過多輪措施，截至二零一七年底，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款成數已降至四十九%，較二零零九年九月的六十四%有所下降；同時，平均還款壓力比率亦從二零一零年八月的四十一%下降至三十五%。\n\n2017年，我們成立了決議辦公室，旨在落實國際標準，以處理遭視為「大到不能倒」的經營困難金融機構。此舉有助於避免重蹈2008年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時政府動用公共資金挽救瀕臨破產的金融機構，並能將其倒閉對金融體系、經濟及社會整體造成的衝擊降至最低。\n\n健全的風險管理是銀行業穩健和可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率均遠高於適用法規要求，並位居全球前列。這無疑體現了香港銀行體系的高度韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款額增長16%，資產質量亦保持良好。零售銀行不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。銀行業整體股東權益回報率（以稅前營運利潤計算）於2017年達到11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心而言，處於非常健康的水平。\n\n# 健全的銀行體制是長期金融穩定的關鍵。\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示了單純依賴規則和法規，難以有效約束金融業在追求利潤時忽略其首要責任的局限性。鑑於此，香港金融管理局近年來加強推動「健全銀行業」的實踐，鼓勵銀行發展良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是為了解決銀行員工為追求短期利益而損害客戶或銀行長期利益的問題，我們正鼓勵銀行建立與其企業文化和價值觀相符的適當激勵制度。作為此項工作的一部分，我們於2017年3月舉辦首屆獨立非執行董事年度大會，旨在強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並提升獨立非執行董事履行監督和監察職責的能力。\n\n在銀行業界的支持下，2017年是香港金融管理局在推動金融普惠方面取得成功的一年。當年共有六間實體銀行分行及三間流動分行在偏遠地區開始營運。香港銀行公會與EPS及一家便利店連鎖店合作，推出試點計劃，讓長者毋須購物即可在偏遠地區的商店提領現金。香港郵政今年亦將在七間郵局推出長者現金提領服務，這些郵局主要設於離島及新界地區。至於開戶事宜，金管局去年設立專頁及電子郵件地址，並由專責團隊跟進公眾的查詢或投訴。得益於各方共同努力，個人及企業銀行戶口開設的客戶體驗已顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技：銀行業的格局變革者\n\n在科技日新月異的時代，金融科技已漸漸融入我們的日常生活。面對瞬息萬變的科技環境，銀行必須積極擁抱新發展，並致力於金融科技應用的創新。為迎接智慧銀行的新紀元，香港金融管理局於九月推出七項倡議（詳見第106頁），旨在推動銀行業採用金融科技，提升銀行產品及服務的質素，為客戶帶來更優質的體驗。 這些倡議各自獨立，但彼此互補，將為香港的支付及銀行服務帶來關鍵轉變。客戶將可享受更便捷、高效及安全的支付和銀行服務，並擁有更多選擇及對財務交易更大的自主權。金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的基石，而邁入智慧銀行新紀元，亦為銀行升級轉型提供了絕佳良機。\n\n# 一帶一路與粵港澳大灣區建設所帶來的巨大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日趨激烈，多元化的金融業對香港至關重要。二零一七年，香港金融管理局加強工作，以提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。憑藉香港獨一無二的優勢——以內地為堅實後盾，同時保持國際視野——「一帶一路」倡議和粵港澳大灣區的發展，將為金融和銀行業帶來巨大機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。為配合「一帶一路」倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自成立以來合作夥伴已增至約九十家，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資融資中心奠定了堅實基礎。中國開發銀行於二零一七年在香港發行首期「一帶一路」債券，凸顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面所能發揮的關鍵作用。\n\n除了基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極推動香港發展成為企業財務中心、私人股權基金及亞洲衍生產品業務樞紐，吸引跨國企業和主要金融機構在本港管理其資金、資產及各項財務風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固並提升香港的金融及相關專業服務業。香港金融管理局亦與負責粵港澳大灣區發展的有關當局保持密切溝通，加強合作，以促進該區域成為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港金融業在「發揮香港優勢，支持國家發展」的方針下持續發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年七月開通債券通北向交易以來，透過香港的金融平台，內地與世界其他地區的市場互聯互通已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這充分體現了香港作為金融中介的獨特作用，促進了全球投資者參與內地金融市場。2017年，香港繼續保持全球主要的離岸人民幣業務中心地位。人民幣實時總額結算系統的平均每日成交額達人民幣9000億元。此外，根據環球銀行金融電訊協會（SWIFT）的統計數據，當年全球人民幣支付交易超過70%經由香港處理。離岸人民幣市場持續穩健運作，並保持穩定發展。\n\n# 培養人才以強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融業的持續發展，人才培育對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局（HKMA）非常重視銀行業的競爭優勢，並一直積極鼓勵和支持銀行從業人員的專業發展。在推出加強專業能力框架後，我們引入了反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資和網絡安全兩項模組，去年更擴展了其涵蓋範圍，納入了零售財富管理和財管業務，藉此提升銀行從業人員的核心能力。香港金融管理局亦致力於培育銀行業的年輕人才。二零一七年，我們與業界合作推出了私人財富管理學徒計劃和金融科技職業加速計劃。鑑於反應熱烈，未來將進一步擴展這些計劃的覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 穩健投資策略，實現中長期合理且穩定的回報。\n\n在全球經濟強勁增長的帶動下，去年香港發鈔銀行基金錄得創紀錄的投資收入2640億港元，股票、債券及外匯等各類資產均獲利。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率為12.1%，而輔助投資組合則錄得1.8%的收益。自2009年成立以來，長期增長組合的年化內部回報率已高達13.7%。儘管去年的投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境仍要求香港金融管理局繼續審慎管理發鈔銀行基金。我們將保持靈活應變，密切監察市場動態，並在適當時候採取防禦措施。長期增長組合的投資規模亦將進一步擴大。與往常一樣，在管理香港市民的財富時，我們將堅持「以資本保值為先，追求長遠增長」的投資原則，並在可接受的風險水平內運作。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續去年的增長勢頭，2018年仍潛藏諸多不確定性與風險。這些風險包括：倘若通脹壓力升高，美國可能加快升息步伐；貿易摩擦加劇；以及地緣政治局勢惡化。一旦這些下行風險顯現，將對全球金融市場造成重大且廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格及實體經濟產生連帶效應。因此，我們務必審慎管理相關風險。\n\n未來數月，港元利率走勢很可能持續為市場關注的焦點。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備系統已六次加息。隨著港元利率與美元利率之間的利差擴大，資金從港元流向美元的誘因亦隨之增加。近期港元面臨貶值壓力，已觸發7.85弱方兌換保證（CU）。正如我們多次指出，當觸發7.85弱方兌換保證時，香港金融管理局將扮演主要買賣港元及美元的角色，在市場上買入港元、賣出美元，以確保港元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。此舉屬正常操作，符合聯繫匯率制度的設計，無需過分擔憂。事實上，外匯基金目前持有超過4萬億港元的資產，其中港元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，為資金外流提供了充裕的緩衝。多年來，金管局已建立多項防禦機制，以維護銀行及金融體系的穩定。從積極的角度來看，資金外流將導致港元利率逐步上升，有助於香港利率環境的正常化，進而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，金管局將保持警惕，全力維持香港的貨幣和銀行體系穩定。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟步調一致擴張的背景下，香港在2017年錄得較快的經濟增長、勞動市場趨緊，以及平穩的通脹壓力。預計2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。\n\n# 經濟概況\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在全球經濟擴張更趨協調的背景下，香港經濟在2017年實現了較快增長。實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長率升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%及過去十年約3%的長期增長率（見圖1和表1）。 內需增強，私人消費增長加速，整體投資支出亦告復甦。 內需強勁主要得益於良好的就業和收入狀況、資產價格上漲以及企業信心的改善。 對外方面，香港商品出口因全球貿易流量增加而增速加快；服務出口則受貿易及貨運流量活躍和來港旅遊改善的帶動而恢復增長。 商品進口因出口需求增加而顯著增長，服務進口亦隨着居民旅遊意願強勁而穩步上升。 總體而言，貿易順差縮小，對GDP增長構成拖累。\n\n\n# 貨幣環境\n\n在貨幣方面，港元兌美元匯率主要因港元與美元之間的負利率差所帶動的利率套利而走弱。這反映了聯繫匯率制度按照其設計正常運作。雖然港元利率仍處於相對低水平，但由於首次公開發行相關的融資需求以及銀行年底流動性需求，2017年底該利率面臨更大的上升壓力。在信貸增長方面，總貸款在經歷了兩年個位數增長後，2017年大幅增長16.1%，反映經濟狀況改善及金融市場情緒樂觀。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸標準並未放寬，整體貸款質量仍保持良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2017年全年通脹壓力維持於可控水平（圖2）。扣除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響，核心通脹率降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%有所下降。尤其值得注意的是，物價指數中住宅部分的增幅放緩，反映2016年私人住宅新租賃租金增長放緩的影響。整體而言，強勁的產出增長帶動名義工資和收入溫和增長，有助於抑制本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦保持平穩，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹情況相符，即使美元走弱亦未有明顯影響。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年，隨著經濟增長優於預期，勞動市場趨緊。經季節調整後，失業率從2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，為近20年來首次低於3%（圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門的失業率均有下降，其中零售業、金融業以及專業及商業服務業的降幅尤為顯著。總體就業人數增長加速，私人部門職缺增加，整體勞動需求持續增強。勞動力亦有所擴張，部分反映55歲及以上年長勞工的勞動參與度提高。與勞動市場趨緊及通貨膨脹率下降的情況一致，實質工資與所得的增幅亦加快。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2017年幾乎連綿上漲。恆生指數上漲36%，為自2010年以來的最大年度漲幅（圖4）。這波漲勢反映了市場對全球經濟及企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並受益於內地投資者透過滬港通、深港通帶來的大量資金流入。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底維持在高位。平均每日成交額由前一年的669億港元擴大至883億港元，本地市場集資額亦增至5814億港元，較一年前的4901億港元增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持上漲趨勢（圖表四）。交易量由去年的五萬四千七百零一宗增加至六萬一千五百九十一宗，而二零一七年樓價上升百分之十四點八。房屋可負擔性進一步下降，價格收入比達十六點四，高於一九九七年的歷史高位，按揭收入比為七十四點一，遠高於長期平均水平。鑒於樓價持續上漲及銀行間按揭業務競爭加劇，香港金融管理局於五月推出第八輪審慎監管措施，以加強銀行風險管理並維護銀行體系穩定。受此措施影響，房屋價格增長一度趨緩，但於第四季再次加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，全年交易活動顯著增加，成交額及成交量均錄得雙位數增長。隨着非住宅物業價格回升，租金回報率較去年略為下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟狀況\n\n預計2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。政府預測增長率將介於3%至4%之間，而私人機構分析師則預計經濟平均增長率為3.2%。 外部方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受益於全球經濟前景的改善以及來港旅遊業的逐步復甦。 內部方面，私人消費增長預期將維持穩定，主要得益於良好的勞工市場狀況。至於固定資本形成，建築活動預料將因住宅供應增加及持續的基礎設施項目而穩步推進。 儘管經濟狀況改善將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升或會構成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n在全球通脹維持溫和，本地成本穩步上升的情況下，預料香港在2018年的通脹壓力將保持溫和，但通脹率可能較2017年的低位逐步回升。例如，由於私人住宅新租賃的租金上升，通脹中的租金成分在2018年下半年或將加速上漲。市場普遍預測2018年的整體通脹率仍將維持在2.2%，而政府預測核心通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築及建造活動的擴張，以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦，預計將維持勞動力市場的緊張情況。私人機構分析員預測2018年的失業率將維持約3.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2018年的經濟展望存在多項不確定性及風險，包括主要央行貨幣政策正常化、全球金融市場穩定性，以及保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張局勢惡化。特別是，若這些風險顯現並引發香港資金流動逆轉，本地貨幣狀況可能較預期更快收緊，對實體經濟和資產價格構成下行壓力。\n\n住宅房地產市場的展望仍然不明朗。短期內，現有的良好國內經濟狀況、普遍認定的房屋短缺、低按揭利率，以及其他房屋融資途徑（包括房地產發展商提供的按揭貸款和家人的資助），將持續支撐物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售或將緩和投資者情緒。長遠來看，房地產市場將持續面臨多項挑戰。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策的正常化，本地按揭利率最終將會上漲。此外，在政府積極增加土地和住宅供應的推動下，房屋供需缺口預計將逐漸縮小，這將有助於減緩房價的上漲壓力。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n儘管全球經濟存在不確定性，香港銀行業在2017年仍保持穩健。授權機構的資本和流動性狀況依然強勁，資產質量維持健康水平，並得益於利差擴大及信貸增長強勁，盈利能力顯著提升。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化進程持續，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的一個月及三個月期定價分別上升49個基點及39個基點，其中第四季升幅尤為顯著。儘管如此，以綜合利率計算的零售銀行港元資金成本在全年內大致保持平穩（圖5）。\n\n# 獲利能力趨勢\n\n零售銀行香港分行於2017年稅前經營利潤增長了15.8%。表現改善主要得益於淨利息收入增加20.3%及手續費和佣金收入增加9.4%。然而，外匯及衍生工具業務收入減少29.9%，以及經營支出增長8.4%，部分抵銷了這些增長。由於2016年錄得的某些非經常性項目，零售銀行的稅後利潤下降了18.1%。零售銀行的平均資產稅後回報率從2016年的1.44%下降至1.07%（圖表6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差從2016年的1.32%擴大至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上漲。\n\n零售銀行的非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例，由2016年的44.3%降至40%。手續費及佣金收入增長9.4%，但外匯及衍生工具業務的收入則減少29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的營運成本與營收比率由2016年的43.2%降至2017年的41.9%，原因是營運成本增長8.4%，低於營運收入增長11.8%（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值撥備由2016年的80億港幣減少至73億港幣。\n\n# 資產素質\n\n零售銀行的貸款品質在本年度有所改善，分類貸款比率由前一年的0.72%降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣地，整體銀行業的分類貸款比率及逾期及重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行住宅按揭貸款組合的質素保持良好，截至2017年底，不良貸款比率維持在0.03%的低水平（見圖10）。重組貸款比率接近零。年底並無出現負資產的住宅按揭貸款，較一年前的四宗案例顯著減少。\n\n截至2017年底，信用卡貸款的違約率維持在0.22%，較去年同期的0.24%略降（圖10）。 逾期及重新安排貸款比率下降至0.31%，較之前的0.33%減少。核銷比率亦從2016年的1.92%小幅降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表動態\n\n銀行業總貸款於2017年增長16.1%，較2016年的6.5%顯著增加。 受到全球經濟前景樂觀的影響，信貸需求上升。 總存款增長速度慢於總貸款，導致整體貸款與存款比率由一年前的68.4%上升至2017年底的73%。 同期，港元貸款與存款比率亦由77.1%上升至82.7%（圖表11）。\n\n與內地相關的貸款（包括本地註冊銀行內地分行的貸款）在2017年增長了17.5%，較2016年的7%增長率明顯提高。\n\n# 可交易債務證券持有量\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管港元匯率的壓力已有所減弱，港元匯兌及貨幣市場仍維持有序運作，流動性充裕。聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的堅實後盾，並經受住各種衝擊的考驗。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這指香港貨幣與美元的匯率在外的匯市上，保持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元之間。香港的貨幣制度採用貨幣局制度，規定貨幣基礎必須由外匯基金持有的美元儲備完全支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動，均須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供擔保；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣和硬幣；\n- 結算餘額，即銀行在香港金融管理局（金管局）的清算賬戶餘額總和；\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據（Exchange Fund Bills and Notes，EFBNs）。\n\n香港港元的匯率穩定，仰賴自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）。當市場對港元的需求超過供應，且匯率升至強方聯繫匯率限額每美元7.75港元時，香港金融管理局隨時準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此舉將增加結餘總額，降低港元利率，從而營造有利於港元匯率遠離強方限位，並維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換區間內的貨幣環境。反之，若港元供應超過需求，匯率跌至弱方聯繫匯率限額每美元7.85港元時，香港金融管理局將向銀行買入港元。此舉將減少結餘總額，提高港元利率，從而推動港元匯率遠離弱方限位，並維持在兌換區間內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n2017年，港元兌美元匯率整體趨於走弱（圖1）。主要受到港元與美元利率負利差擴大所帶動的套利活動影響，港元對美元匯率從1月3日的7.7566逐步走弱至8月22日的年內低點7.8265。9月下旬至11月上旬，由於首次公開招股（IPO）相關資金需求導致港元流動性收緊，港元匯率一度回升，並在7.80至7.81的窄幅區間內保持穩定。年底時，港元再次出現走弱壓力，部分反映港元流動性條件略有改善，以及年底商業對美元的需求增加。總體而言，2017年港元匯市運作正常。\n\n由於未觸發相關計量工具，2017年總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據總額維持在約1,225.3億港元（見圖表2）。 該年，香港金融管理局為應對銀行增加的流動性管理需求，共發行了額外800億港元的外匯基金票據。此舉導致總結餘在2017年底收縮至179.8億港元。發行額外外匯基金票據符合貨幣局原則，僅代表貨幣基礎的組成部分發生變化，即從總結餘轉移至未償還的外匯基金票據。 貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行同業拆息保持偏低水平，但年底開始面臨更大的上升壓力（圖3）。儘管市場對美國聯邦儲備委員會加息及資產負債表調整的擔憂，港元銀行同業拆息在前八個月大致仍維持穩健。因此，港元與美元利率之間的負利差在1月至8月期間擴大。自9月起，短期港元銀行同業拆息因首次公開募股（IPO）相關需求及年底資金需求而顯著上升。與此同時，短期負利差亦有所收窄。總體而言，2017年短期銀行同業拆息大多在基準利率以下交易。\n\n基準利率於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日分別調升，全年累計上調75個基點，由1.00%調升至1.75%。此舉源於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次上調，總計75個基點，由0.50–0.75%調升至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整依據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，該公式規定基準利率應設定為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限之上50個基點，或過夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）五日移動平均值的平均數，取較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤港元與美元利率差的走勢，港元遠期點數的折讓在首三個季度逐步擴大，9月中旬12個月期港元遠期點數達到約-615個基點（見圖4）。第四季度，隨著港元與美元利率負差的縮窄，港元遠期點數的折讓也略為收窄。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續有序運作，銀行間流動性保持充裕。貼現窗口貸款額由2016年的53億港元增至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石，並在歷次區域性及全球性金融危機中展現出高度韌性。政府重申對聯繫匯率制度的堅定承諾，而外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了其可信度。香港公眾對港元作為支付工具及價值儲存手段的信心依然強勁。在二零一七年國際貨幣基金組織對香港的第四條諮詢（IMF Article IV Consultation）中，對方重申支持聯繫匯率制度，並認為此制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率安排。聯繫匯率制度結合穩健的金融監管、審慎的財政管理及靈活的市場機制，有效協助香港成功應對內外各種挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯繫匯率制度仍是香港的最佳安排。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。二零一七年，香港金融管理局（金管局）持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業貸款、與物業相關的貸款以及與內地相關的貸款的監管力度，以增強銀行體系的韌性。鑒於美國聯邦儲備系統持續正常化其貨幣政策，港元利率將逐漸趨於正常化。金管局重申，根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，資金外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方兌換保證以及貨幣基礎減少，均是港元利率正常化過程中的必要環節。金管局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並為潛在的金融波動做好準備。\n\n為提高外匯基金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分撥作支持貨幣基礎。背書比率（即背書資產除以貨幣基礎）在2017年維持於106.7%至108.2%之間，未觸及上下限。截至12月31日，該比率收市為108.1%（圖5）。根據聯動匯率制度（LERS），雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為背書組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。若發生突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源將為維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大後盾。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣板委員會（CBC）負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。二零一七年，委員會審議了多項議題，包括香港房價短期動態的驅動因素、港元同業拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）利差的決定因素、物業估值變動對中國內地企業借貸的影響，以及按揭貸款還款負擔對香港私人消費的影響。委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予委員會的貨幣板運作報告，均已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n香港貨幣研究學院（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR已將其工作重心轉向更具政策影響力的方向。這一點尤其體現在其研討會活動及訪問學者計劃上。HKIMR正與主要央行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦更多著重政策議題的研討會。同時，自2016年推出的主題研究訪問學者計劃，亦支持了更多與香港金融管理局（HKMA）關注的重要政策研究項目。\n\n二零一七年，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了十八位研究員，並發表了二十九篇工作論文。該中心當年亦主辦了四場國際會議及研討會：\n-   第一場為一月在香港舉行的第八屆國際中華經濟會議，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：未來趨勢」。本次會議為學者、政策制定者及商業經濟學家提供了一個探討中國內地經濟相關重要分析及政策議題的平台。會議共發表了十一篇高質量研究論文，內容涵蓋內地經濟再平衡、結構性改革及國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地貨幣政策框架與傳導機制等廣泛議題。\n-   第二場為七月舉行的第十五屆HKIMR夏季研討會。研討會旨在為HKIMR及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的員工提供發表研究成果的機會，並促進研究人員與訪問研究員之間的交流互動。\n-   第三場為八月由香港金融管理局（HKMA）與國際清算銀行（BIS）聯合舉辦的會議，主題為「匯率的價格、實質與金融影響」。會議為深入且富於洞察力的討論提供了平台，涵蓋了匯率制度、國際貿易定價機制、外匯儲備累積過程中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為等重要議題。\n-   第四場為十月由香港金融管理局（HKMA）、美國聯邦儲備理事會（Federal Reserve Board）及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行共同贊助的會議，主題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓」。會議回顧了過去十年主要央行實施非常規貨幣政策（UMP）所獲得的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟與金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","zh":"# 金融體系穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局持續將監管重點放在持牌金融機構的風險治理框架有效性上，涵蓋信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，金管局再推出一輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，以增強銀行業應對物業市場下行風險的能力。隨着網絡威脅日益增加，金管局加強對持牌金融機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，金管局啟動七項舉措，為香港邁向智慧銀行新時代做好準備。為打擊金融犯罪，持牌金融機構的反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施的有效性仍然是金管局監管的重點。在行為監管方面，金管局進一步推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融普及化，並協助中小企業及初創公司解決在香港開設及維持銀行帳戶時遇到的困難。此外，金管局亦致力加強對持牌金融機構投資及保險產品銷售行為的監管，以進一步加強客戶保障。\n\n香港金融管理局在國際監管及會計準則的本地實施方面取得了顯著進展，涵蓋資本充足率標準、資訊披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險敞口限制、復甦計劃以及國際財務報告準則第9號。為配合銀行環境的快速演變及風險格局的持續變化，並提升業界的專業能力，金管局與業界攜手合作，推出董事能力提升計劃及銀行業從業員專業能力發展框架。\n\n《金融機構（重整）條例》於二零一七年七月七日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨行業金融機構重整程序的金融穩定理事會成員管轄區之一。 該條例為金融穩定構建了新的防線，並賦予貨幣當局在金融機構出現可能對系統造成不利影響的情況下，以有序方式管理其失敗的必要權力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標有賴於金融體系具備高度韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其營運方式，可能影響金融體系的穩定。在極端情況下，銀行若以混亂方式倒閉，更可能引發系統性風險。作為監管機構，貨幣管理局在維護金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，透過確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中迅速恢復，從而有效防範金融機構破產。貨幣管理局負責在香港對銀行業務進行審慎監管，包括接受存款業務。其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照的銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構統稱為授權機構。此外，貨幣管理局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施。\n\n然而，金管局無法保證金融體系零風險，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在達到此目的。相反，金管局作為解決機制制度的執行者，致力於確保人工智能機構出現問題時，能以有序的方式進行處理，以維持其向客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的持續運作。為此，香港已建立一套適用於金融機構的解決機制制度，金管局則擔任該制度下人工智能機構及其他金融機構的解決權威。\n\n# 二零一七年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了192次非現場審查，覆蓋範圍廣泛，包括資產投資機構（AIs）的CAMEL評級¹、公司治理、業務營運及風險管理。為持續提升AIs的風險治理水平，HKMA與AIs的董事會或董事級委員會舉行了30次會議，重點討論重要的風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監察其最新公司治理指引的採納情況。此外，HKMA與AIs及其外部審計師之間亦召開了27次三方會議。\n\n除了境外活動外，香港金融管理局持續進行定期的現場檢查，並輔以針對風險較高的領域進行主題審查。這種做法使金管局能夠優先調配監管資源，專注於認可金融機構所面臨的新興及更重要的風險。在過去一年，金管局共進行了401次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理及控制仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。科技風險和營運風險管理亦為主要關注領域。此外，金管局增加了海外檢查的數量，以及針對流動性風險、市場風險管理以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/反恐融資）控制措施的現場檢查和主題審查。專業團隊亦對認可金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險監督\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n銀行貸款總額增長16.1%，較2016年的6.5%大幅提升。如表2所示，貸款增長呈現多方面擴展。\n\n截至2017年底，與中國大陸相關的貸款增長17.5%，達到4188億港元（表3）。其中包括由在香港註冊成立的銀行內地子公司入帳的6440億港元貸款。\n\n2017年，金融機構的資產品質維持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水準2.2%。整體銀行業的不良貸款比率則從0.85%降至0.67%。至於與中國大陸相關的貸款，零售銀行該類貸款的不良貸款比率在2017年降至0.75%，較前一年的0.82%有所下降。整體銀行業的該比率則從0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局加強了對持牌機構的監管，以確保其持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，加強了對持牌機構對主要企業風險敞口的監測。並進行了針對性的主題檢查，重點審視貸款審批標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及房地產開發商貸款、資產擔保融資和保險費融資的風險管理等關鍵控制措施。\n\n# 房產抵押貸款\n\n2017年物業價格持續上漲。金融機構新增貸款中，涉及擁有多項按揭貸款或收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人個案增加。鑒於此情況，香港金融管理局於5月19日推出新一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高金融機構計算新住宅按揭貸款資本要求時的風險權重下限，降低向已持有按揭貸款的借款人提供的物業按揭貸款貸款價值比率（LTV）上限，以及降低向主要收入來源為香港以外地區的借款人提供的物業按揭貸款債務償還比率（DSR）上限。\n\n香港金融管理局自2009年起推行的房地產按揭貸款宏觀審慎措施，已提升銀行對房地產市場風險的抵禦能力。在首次實施逆周期措施之前，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率由2009年9月的64%下降至2017年12月的49%。平均債務服務比率亦由2010年8月首次實施上限時的41%下降至2017年12月的35%（圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局觀察到，部分發展商以高負債融資其房地產發展項目，並有部分發展商向買家提供高貸款價值比率的按揭貸款。為應對這些發展項目所帶來的風險，金管局於5月12日推出新的風險管理措施，規管向房地產發展商的貸款。這些措施包括：要求持牌機構 (AI) 降低建築融資的融資上限；要求持牌機構 (AI) 為向貸款與股權比例較高的房地產發展商提供的貸款，撥備更多資本；以及進行一輪主題審查，以確保銀行在向房地產發展商提供貸款時，繼續遵守審慎的承銷標準。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局於二月與土地註冊處合作推出電子提示服務。此服務會在有關按揭物業的進一步按揭於土地註冊處登記時，即時通知相關的金融機構，以便該機構採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監控\n\n全年網絡安全威脅持續上升。香港金融管理局（金管局）加強監管，以提升銀行業的網絡安全韌性。作為金管局於2016年推出的網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）的一部分，30間認可機構已完成對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。此外，金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）在與銀行及證券業界廣泛諮詢後，共同決定推行網上股票交易的強制雙因素認證。同時，亦進行了一輪現場檢查，重點關注銀行在網絡安全控制及運營韌性方面的表現。金管局進一步與主要銀行的高層管理人員進行討論，以評估銀行如何應對科技進步帶動的潛在新市場參與者所構成的策略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n九月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布了一系列措施，以協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行的新時代。在監管方面，香港金融管理局將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行及科技公司均可使用的聊天室設施，並將香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及保險業監管局（IA）的沙盒互相連接，為跨行業金融科技產品的試驗提供統一的平台。\n\n香港金融管理局亦啟動了「銀行服務更便捷」計劃，旨在識別並減低監管上的阻礙，從而進一步提升客戶使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的體驗。目前已成立專責小組，重點關注遠程開戶及戶口維護、網上金融及網上資產管理。\n\n香港已展開對現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的檢討，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 庫務活動監控與流動性風險管理\n\n隨著美國持續將貨幣政策恢復正常，全球資金流動可能趨於波動。鑒於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在年內加強了對流動風險的監管。HKMA 提升了監管性流動性壓力測試，增加了更多情境，包括更嚴峻但合理的資金外流情境，以及短期、信心觸發的銀行擠提情境。此外，HKMA 加強了對個別授權金融機構（AIs）流動性狀況的監測與分析，並要求部分 AIs 加強其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）就認可金融機構（AIs）的債務證券投資組合的市場風險管理，進行了更多現場檢查。為評估認可金融機構增加投資外幣債券所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相關風險管理措施（包括對沖策略）的有效性，金管局進行了一輪主題審查。\n\n# 防範洗錢及恐怖主義融資（ML\/TF）\n\n《2017年反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於6月23日刊憲，並將於2018年開始生效。本次修訂旨在根據金融行動特別工作組（FATF）最新發布的國際要求，更新香港的反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資監管制度。 這些修訂連同對反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資法定指引的更新，將有助於釐清並落實客戶盡職調查（CDD）程序中，針對開戶及維持真實客戶關係的風險為本方法，並鼓勵在遠程進行相關程序時的創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新措施旨在促進銀行及支付行業的金融科技發展，並獲得業界及公眾的廣泛讚賞。藉由一系列在基礎設施投資融資領域的網絡和能力建設，香港作為相關投資的國際樞紐地位進一步提升。債券通的推出更鞏固了香港作為通往中國內地投資機會的主要渠道。香港金融管理局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力亦已初見成效。\n\n# 概述\n\n鑑於科技的快速發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布推出七項措施，以準備香港邁向智慧銀行的新時代。 這些措施包括：\n- 發展快速支付系統（FPS），以實現數字零售支付的全面連通；\n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究及人才培育；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行；以及\n- 推動「銀行易」新計劃，以減少客戶數碼體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局銀行部門攜手推動這些措施，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際地位進一步提升，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴數目於2018年1月31日已增至87家，較其創立時的約40家顯著增加。同年，IFFO舉辦及參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，以促進主要利益相關者之間的經驗交流和合作網絡。尤其值得一提的是，IFFO在其首次債務融資及投資者圓桌會議上主導了基礎設施股權投資參考條款表的制定，旨在提升基礎設施項目的融資可行性及投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月正式開通，為香港與內地資本市場互聯互通再添重要里程碑，進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。年內，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由人民幣2700億元增加至人民幣5000億元。香港繼續保持全球最大規模的人民幣離岸流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動蓬勃發展，體現在本港人民幣實時全額結算（RTGS）系統的高交易量，以及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據主導地位。\n\n自2016年引入企業財務中心（CTC）稅制後，香港金融管理局加強了推廣工作，以吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立財務中心。截至2017年底，逾40間企業向香港金融管理局反映，正積極計劃或已設立財務中心業務。\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際間關於全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題討論。香港金融管理局局長於四月擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管與監督合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，帶領討論關鍵的金融穩定議題。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港鞏固作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位奠定了堅實基礎。二零一七年，四個銀行間即時毛額結算系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）的系統可用率達至百分之百，高於目標值九十九點九五%。為配合債券通北向交易，CMU已與兩家內地中央證券登記結算機構（CSDs）設立帳戶，便利債券通交易的結算，並代表相關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為提升本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，香港金融管理局於八月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定四個零售支付系統（RPS），將其運作納入監管範疇。香港金融管理局亦對十六間積極推出新產品及服務的儲值支付工具（SVF）持牌機構進行監管，這些新產品及服務旨在為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。此外，電子支票（e-Cheque）及電子帳單呈遞及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與廣東省全境之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 二零一七年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐\n\n# 智慧銀行策略\n\n鑑於科技快速發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布七項措施，以協助香港邁向智慧銀行新時代。這些措施旨在提升銀行業水平，並把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n智慧銀行將為零售客戶與企業客戶提供全面互聯互通的服務，讓金融交易和服務更快速、更便捷、更安全。\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界及金融科技界密切合作，並在落實七項倡議方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 更快的支付系統\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）是一個多幣種平台，讓公眾可透過手機號碼或電郵地址，隨時輕鬆地進行即時資金轉帳。此系統支援港幣及人民幣支付，銀行和非銀行支付服務供應商均可參與，實現所有參與者之間的全面連繫。由於系統開發工作已接近完成，快速支付系統預計於二零一八年九月正式推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個工作小組，成員包括主要信用卡方案營運商、銀行、持牌儲值支付工具營運商及商戶收單機構，旨在為香港零售支付建立統一的二維碼標準。統一的二維碼標準將便利商戶使用單一二維碼接受來自多個支付服務提供者的二維碼支付方案，為客戶和商戶帶來更大便利。工作小組已完成相關技術規範，並將制定具體的落實安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放應用程式介面（Open API）讓銀行數據可供第三方存取，藉此促進銀行及其他行業服務的整合，提升便利性。用戶可於同一系統內，安全地享受整合服務。為推動銀行業界採用開放應用程式介面，香港金融管理局制定了一份開放應用程式介面框架草案，涵蓋一系列功能、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商的監管、促進措施及維護模式，並開放為期兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n其中一項主要研究專案為分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年首份DLT白皮書問世後，第二份白皮書於2017年10月發布。該白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證項目，包括貿易融資、數位身分管理及房貸申請。此外，亦針對銀行及支付產業部署DLT時的治理、法律合規與一般控制原則等實施問題，提供相關建議。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德南在香港金融科技日公布第二份關於分布式账本技術的白皮書。\n\n受益於香港金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證項目成功，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，並推出名為「香港貿易融資平台」（Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform，HKTFP）的正式系統，以數字化及共享貿易文件、自動化流程，從而提升整體貿易流程效率，並降低貿易融資業務的風險和欺詐行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金融管理局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出「金融科技人才加速計劃」。此計劃反應踴躍，共收到421名申請人提交的3,000多份申請。最終，74名學生接受香港金融管理局及12間銀行的實習機會，自2017年7月起參與金融科技相關項目，實習期為六個月或一年。\n\n# 跨境協作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的第一步，我們與深圳合作，共同推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於六月簽訂協議，內容包括：（一）為金融科技企業提供互惠的軟著陸支援；（二）於十月聯合舉辦深港金融科技獎，以表彰兩地優秀的金融科技產品及解決方案；以及（三）安排香港學生到深圳的金融科技及科技金融企業實習。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德南先生（中），於香港金管局金融科技日與國際金融服務發展局總監何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席林家安博士簽署並交換關於軟著陸安排的諒解備忘錄。\n\n深圳香港金融科技獎單張\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務管理局簽訂金融科技合作協議，內容涵蓋創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊分享及專業知識交流等。\n\n今年11月，香港金融管理局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署諒解備忘錄，共同建設全球貿易連通網絡（GTCN），將新加坡國家貿易平台與香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）連接，建立跨境區塊鏈基礎設施，以實現貿易及貿易融資流程的數位化，提升其安全性、效率與成本效益。該網絡為開放平台，日後歡迎其他有意參與的地區加入。預計GTCN將於2019年第一季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監督沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局於二零一六年九月推出的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）已升級至FSS 2.0，以加速與銀行及科技公司的溝通，促進新想法和新計劃的推動。FSS 2.0 的新增功能如下：\n- 設立金融科技監管對話室，為銀行及科技公司在金融科技項目初期提供意見回饋。\n- 科技公司可直接透過對話室尋求回饋，無需經由銀行即可使用FSS。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）及保險業監理局的監管沙盒已互相連接，為跨行業金融科技產品的試點計劃提供單一入口。\n\n截至2017年底，已有28項新技術產品在金融科技監管沙盒中完成測試。其中14項試點計畫已完成，相關產品隨後即推向市場。\n\n# 銀行輕鬆辦\n\n為減少阻礙科技創新的規管摩擦，已推出「銀行營運便捷化計劃」。現已成立專責小組，目前重點關注以下領域：\n- 遠端客戶入職及帳戶維護\n- 線上金融服務\n- 線上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行不設實體分行，預期將為香港金融科技應用注入新的動力，並為客戶帶來嶄新的數碼銀行體驗。 這些銀行通常以個人及中小企業為服務對象，有助提升金融服務的普及性。香港金融管理局已展開對現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的檢討，以便利虛擬銀行在香港的發展。\n\n# 智能銀行新時代\n\n# 監督與創新\n\n香港金融管理局去年公布的七項倡議，旨在為香港迎接智慧銀行新時代的準備，這是一項涉及管理局內多個部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為不可逆轉的趨勢，香港金融管理局執行董事（銀行監管）陳德霖表示，作為監管機構，管理局必須緊跟最新科技發展，適時調整監管思維與方法，以將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新水平。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets as at 31 December 2017.\n\nHKMA Deputy Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (middle), speaks at the press conference on 2017 Exchange Fund Results.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994–2017)\n\nTable 2 Investment return of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong dollar terms\n\nTable 3 Currency mix of the Exchange Fund’s assets on 31 December 2017 (including forward transactions)\n","zh":"# 備付金管理\n\n2017年全球經濟和金融市場表現優於預期。全球股市在主要發達國家和新興市場經濟體同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將緩慢且漸進地收緊貨幣政策的帶動下上漲。儘管美國聯邦儲備委員會如期加息三次，並於10月開始縮減資產負債表，但10年期美國國債收益率保持穩定，美元對其他主要貨幣反而走弱（而非走強）。在這樣有利的環境下，儲備基金2017年的投資收入達到創紀錄的2640億港元，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》的規定，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯價。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全，以協助香港保持國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長控制，並可於諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後，投資於其認為適當的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）為外匯基金設定了以下投資目標：\n(a) 保持資本；\n(b) 始終確保全部貨幣基礎均由高度流動性的美元計值資產完全支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以幫助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了匯換基金的法定宗旨，並已整合入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置。\n\n外匯基金廣義而言設有兩個主要投資組合：後盾組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。後盾組合持有高度流動的美元計價資產，旨在根據固定匯率制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供充分的備抵。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場，以保值並維持資產的長期購買力。\n\n為更有效管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局正以謹慎且穩健的方式，逐步將外匯基金的部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票投資於投資組合（IP）內，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）的投資市值上限設定為外匯基金累積盈餘的三分之一，並可透過將部分未來基金配置於長期資產以進一步擴大投資餘裕。\n\n戰略投資組合於二零零七年成立，旨在持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司股份，該等股份由政府代表外匯基金以策略性目的購入。鑒於此組合的特殊性質，其投資表現未納入基金整體評估範圍內。\n\n# 聯匯基金職務安排\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存放。利率一般與IP1表現相關，未來基金則依據投資組合的組成，將利率與IP及LTGP兩者調整。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為65:35。預計與LTGP相關的未來基金比例將逐步增加至約50%，於2018年實現。\n\n# 投資過程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程，建立在兩種資產配置決策之上：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置體現於投資基準，反映在考慮外匯基金投資目標下，所訂定的長期最佳資產配置方案。在策略性配置的指導下，會對資產進行戰術性調整，以期超越投資基準的回報。這表示實際資產配置往往與基準或策略性配置存在差異。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。投資基準和追蹤誤差限額由財政司司長在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後決定，而戰術決策及戰術偏離的容許幅度則由香港金融管理局在授權下制定。在容許的偏離幅度內，投資組合經理可根據短期市場變化，靈活運用投資策略。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部直接管理外匯基金約73%的投資，其中包括全部的BP及部分IP。這部分IP包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及利用衍生工具進行風險調節的投資組合，以實施基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘管理人員\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦會聘用外部基金經理管理約佔外匯基金資產27%的資金，其中包括其所有上市股權投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的，是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識以獲取可持續回報，從多元化且互補的投資風格中獲益，並與外匯基金分享市場洞察及技術專長。\n\n與外部管理人產生之支出，包括基金管理費、保管費用、交易成本以及預扣稅款和其他稅項。此等支出主要受市場因素影響，每年可能有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理及法規遵循\n\n自2008至2009年全球金融危機以來，金融市場的劇烈波動凸顯了風險管理的重要性。為內外管理的投資組合已建立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監察合規情況。風險評估已加強，以支持金管局加快投資多元化步伐。風險控制工具被應用於評估正常及逆境市場下的市場風險。此外，亦會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，使金管局能善用內外經理的投資專業能力。\n\n# 社會責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局支持證券及期貨事務監理委員會於二零一六年三月七日發佈的《負責任擁有原則》，這些原則屬自願性質，有助投資者確定如何最佳地履行其對香港上市公司的投資責任。在管理外匯基金方面，金管局已鼓勵其香港股票投資組合所委任的外部基金管理機構在投資管理中採納《負責任擁有原則》。此外，投資事務部及風險管理及合規部已將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入多項內部程序，以制定及監察投資活動。香港金融管理局將密切關注ESG標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入投資流程。\n\n# 外匯基金表現\n\n# 二零一七年金融市場概況\n\n2017年全球經濟與金融市場表現優於預期。在主要發達經濟體與新興市場經濟體同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將逐步收緊貨幣政策的推動下，全球股市表現良好。尤其香港股市上漲了百分之三十六，表現優於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場，美國聯邦準備系統連續三次升息，並於十月開始縮減資產負債表，導致短期美國國債殖利率急升。然而，美國10年期國債殖利率全年保持穩定，約為2.4%。其他主要國家10年期政府債券殖利率變化不大，但德國國債因歐元區經濟強勁成長，以及市場預期歐洲央行將收緊貨幣政策而上漲。\n\n在外匯市場上，儘管美國聯邦儲備系統已調升利率並開始縮減資產負債表，美元兌其他主要貨幣仍呈疲軟。美元的貶值是因歐洲和日本經濟復甦，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策差異將逐漸縮小所致。2017年，歐元和日圓對美元分別升值約14%和4%。\n\n表一顯示了2017年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現。\n\n表1 2017年市場報酬率\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金於2017年錄得投資收入港幣2640億元。其中，海外股票收益為港幣804億元，香港股票收益為港幣583億元，債券收益為港幣344億元，非港元資產的貨幣換算收益為港幣535億元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益為港幣374億元。此外，策略投資組合錄得估值增益港幣45億元。\n\n去年外匯基金投資收益達2640億港元，創下歷史新高，較2007年創下的紀錄（1422億港元）超越1218億港元。\n\n於年底，結匯基金總資產達港幣4,015.3億元。長期投資計劃（LTGP，以下同）項下的投資市值總計為港幣2,356億元，其中私人股權為港幣1,572億元，房地產為港幣784億元。未償投資承諾總額為港幣1,624億元。\n\n二零一七年，外匯基金的投資回報率（不包括策略投資組合）為7.4%。具體而言，指數投資組合（IP）錄得12.1%的回報率，而平衡投資組合（BP）則增長了1.8%。長期增值基金（LTGP）自二零零九年成立以來，年化內部收益率為13.7%。\n\n於1994年至2017年的外匯基金年度回報詳見圖1。表2顯示2017年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間長度內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年的平均回報為2.5%，過去十年的平均回報為2.2%，自1994年以來的平均回報為4.9%。表3顯示截至2017年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組成。\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁余偉文先生（居中）於二零一七年外匯基金的成果記者會上發言。\n\n圖表1 外匯基金投資回報 (1994–2017)\n\n表2 香港外匯基金以港幣計算的投資回報\n\n表3 2017年12月31日交換基金資產的貨幣構成（包括遠期交易）\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n特此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於第157頁至243頁所載的財務報表，該財務報表包括截至2017年12月31日聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收益及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，截至二零一七年十二月三十一日，該基金及集團的財務報表真實且公允地反映了當時的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已依照香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，且符合根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官指示所作出的適當準備。\n\n# 論據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《交換基金條例》第7條發出的指示，以及審計署的審計準則執行審計。我根據該等準則的職責詳情載於本報告「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節。我與本集團保持獨立，並已履行該等準則所規定的其他專業道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證充分及適當，足以支持我的審計意見。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指根據我的專業判斷，在審計2017年12月31日年度財務報表時所識別出的最重要事項。 這些事項是在我審計財務報表整體的背景下處理的，並在形成我的審計意見時予以考慮，但我並未就這些事項另行發表意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資訊。 該資訊包括香港金融管理局2017年年報內的所有內容，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師所發表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且並未就該資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表所作的審計而言，我的責任是查閱其他資訊，並評估其是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或有任何重大錯誤陳述。若經我執行之工作，認為該等資訊存在重大錯誤，我即有報告義務。就此，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 香港金融管理局及匯匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組在財務報表方面的職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條發出的指示，編製真實且公允的財務報表，並建立香港金融管理局認為必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因詐欺或錯誤而導致的重大錯報。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，根據適用情況披露相關事宜，並採用持續經營的會計原則。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會的審計小組負責監管集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的職責\n\n我的目標是取得合理確信，以確認財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯報，無論該錯報是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理確信為高度的信心，但不能保證依照審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，總能偵察到所有已存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源於舞弊或錯誤，若單獨或彙總來看，合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n根據審計委員會審計準則進行審計，我於整個審計過程中秉持專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n- 識別並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論源自舞弊或錯誤，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠及適當的審計證據，作為我意見的基礎。舞弊可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，因此未能發現源自舞弊的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於源自錯誤的風險；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序，但並非為評估集團內部控制的有效性；\n- 評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及會計估計及其相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的事件或情況。若我認為存在重大疑慮，我須在審計師報告中提請關注財務報表中的相關披露，或若披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計師報告日所取得的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構及內容，包括披露資訊，並評估財務報表是否以實現公允呈現的方式反映基礎交易及事件；以及\n- 取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以就集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我負責集團審計的指導、監督及執行，並對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我會向匯換基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會匯報審計的計劃範圍及時間安排，以及重大的審計發現，包括我在審計過程中發現的任何內部控制重大缺陷。\n\n我也向外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們披露所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，如適用，亦提供相關保障措施。\n\n根據與交換基金諮詢委員會審計小組的溝通事項，我確定本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，並將其定為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項可能造成的負面影響合理預期將高於其帶來的公共利益，否則我將在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛\n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要事務\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長以匯兑基金監管人的身份所授予的權力，按照《匯兑基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是維護香港貨幣的兌換價值，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整性。\n\n基金的資產分為四個投資組合管理：後備投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及戰略投資組合。後備投資組合的資產完全對應香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略投資組合持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司股份，由香港特別行政區政府為基金的戰略目的而購入。營運部門資訊詳見附註30。\n\n# 2 重大會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明：\n\n這些財務報表乃根據所有適用的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，其中包括所有個別的香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）所發佈的詮釋，並符合香港一般公認的會計原則。以下為本基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「集團」）所採用之重要會計政策摘要。\n\n香港會計師公會已發布若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則於本會計期間首次生效或可供提早採用。附註三提供有關首次採納這些準則可能導致的會計政策變更的資訊（如有），並說明這些變更與本集團本期及過往會計期間財務報表的相關性。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括本集團的財務報表以及本集團在聯營公司及合營企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務詳見附註十六及十七。\n\n財務報表的編製所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，惟下列資產及負債按其公允價值計量，詳見下列會計政策所述：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註 2.11）；及\n- 投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需要運用判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響會計政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。 這些估計和相關假設乃基於經驗及在當時情況下被認為合理的其他因素，其結果構成評估資產和負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些價值不易從其他來源取得。 實際結果可能與這些估計存在差異。\n\n估計數字及其相關假設會持續進行檢討。會計估計數字的修正，若僅影響當期，則於當期認列；若影響當期及未來期間，則於修正期間及未來期間認列。\n\n附註18載有關於投資性不動產公允價值評估的相關假設資訊。附註36載有關於金融工具公允價值評估的相關假設資訊。除與這些公允價值評估相關的會計判斷外，本集團應用會計政策並無其他重大會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及少數權益\n\n子公司為本集團控制之實體。本集團若對任何實體具備控制權，即表示本集團因參與該實體而有權獲得或承受其盈餘變動，並能透過對該實體的控制權影響該等盈餘。評估本集團是否具備控制權時，僅考慮本集團及其他各方所持有的實質權利。\n"}
