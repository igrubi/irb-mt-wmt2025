{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

2023.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

面對逆境的韌性\n\n在全球經濟成長放緩，且處於「高利率維持較長時間」環境下，地緣政治緊張局勢亦加劇——不僅源於俄烏衝突和中美緊張關係，也包括中東地區衝突的爆發——成為2023年金融市場的主要主題。美國與歐洲三月的銀行動盪，是自2008年全球金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力，進一步打擊市場信心。主要經濟體面臨貨幣政策收緊所帶來的嚴峻現實，以及對通貨膨脹路徑與利率展望的更大不確定性。此外，中國大陸經濟復甦的步伐慢於普遍市場預期，也增加了不確定性。\n\n在全球金融市場的波動與難以預測成為常態之際，香港再次證明其知名適應能力，展現出具韌性的特質。自去年城市全面解除疫情後的限制以來，已進行多項工作以吸引人民重返我們這座多變的城市，並重新連繫他們與香港。香港金融管理局透過舉辦一系列大量國際活動，例如全球金融領導人投資峰會以及與國際清算銀行（BIS）的會議，發揮了作用，展示了我們充滿活力的城市，並幫助向全球傳達信息，即香港作為主要國際金融中心（IFC），持續開放營商，並繼續是行動與創新的中心。目前已有明顯跡象顯示逐步復甦，這是由於入境旅遊業的鼓舞人心復甦及私人消費的改善所推動，亦受到具韌性的勞動市場及政府推出的不同支持措施的支持。就全年而言，2023年香港的國內生產總值增長從2022年的負面領域回復到3.2%。\n\n香港金融管理局於2023年進入其第四十年。過去30年見證了經濟和金融市場的劇烈變化，科技推動了及前瞻任何人想像的推進。過去三十年所累積的寶貴經驗和智慧，使我們能夠以信心面對未來。儘管面對宏觀經濟逆風和不確定的外部環境，香港金融管理局將繼續維護其保護香港貨幣和銀行穩定的職責，並積極推動發展機會，以鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。\n\n前任及現任香港特別行政區財政司司長和香港金融管理局總裁，於慶祝香港金融管理局三十週年聚會上合影留念。（左起）嚴嘉良先生、唐英年先生、曾德成先生、陳茂波先生、余權偉先生、梁錦祥先生、曾俊明先生及陳德霖先生。\n\n#

經受風雨的考驗\n\n去年標誌著掛鈎匯率制度（LERS）40周年，這制度是支持香港雄厚且穩健貨幣及金融體系的堅實支柱。四十年來透明且有效的運作，已培養了市場對掛鈎匯率制度的信心及其可信性。全年港元維持在可兌換範圍內，港元市場運作暢順，反映市場對掛鈎匯率制度的強大信心，國際貨幣基金組織及全球市場參與者亦對此表示肯定。\n\n背後這種信心，是香港金融管理局（HKMA）在公眾及市場活動中的積極努力，連同有效的監察。我們在年內不遺餘力與主要持份者溝通，促進對LERS運作的清晰了解，這在波動的次數，無論源於經濟壓力或政治不明朗因素，尤為重要。我們亦加強了對貨幣系統的監察，藉使用交易倉庫的數據集，拓展銀行的精細數據，以及先進的數據分析和人工智能，提升我們的能力，讓能進行更及時和全面的金融穩定及宏觀審慎分析。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 重要的穩定力量\n\n儘管包括高息環境、持續的地緣政治緊張及充滿挑戰的信貸環境在內的多重挑戰，香港的銀行體系全年維持穩健，並由雄厚的資本及流動性緩衝支持。\n\n截至2023年底，本地銀行的綜合資本比率維持在21.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大量銀行的流動性覆蓋比率截至2023年第四季微升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的100%。雖然分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%，但仍低於長期歷史平均值2.0%。此增加主要推動於對內地私營企業房地產開發商的風險敞口；但由於銀行多年來審慎的信貸風險管理，此類風險敞口更廣泛層面得到詳見控制，銀行業的整體資產品質維持健康。\n\n2023年最令市場參與者感到意外的，無庸置疑是美國的銀行動盪蔓延至歐洲，造成自2008年全球金融危機以來前所未見的系統性銀行壓力。香港金管局隨時關注情況發展，並採取一系列預防性行動，以限制任何潛在的負面影響，維持本地銀行和金融系統的信心。這，以及香港銀行維持雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝，意味著我們的銀行業在很大程度上未受動盪影響，即使全球金融市場動盪不安，仍具韌性。在這起事件之後，香港金管局進行了全面的內部審查，旨在汲取本地銀行業的經驗，並加強香港金管局的監管效能和敏捷性，以便處理可能發生的銀行危機。\n\n儘管審慎的信貸風險管理很重要，我們一直重申對銀行保持支持實體經濟的預期。隨著銀行業預先核准本金償還寬限計劃於2023年7月開始有秩序地退出，且新冠疫情的經濟影響減退，香港金融管理局與銀行緊密合作，以確保貸款償還逐步且暢順過渡，並為持續面對壓力的借款人提供彈性。較早今年，鑑於部分中小企業在疫情結束後仍然面對經營挑戰，推出9項新措施，以進一步協助它們從銀行取得融資。\n\n在銀行物業貸款背景下檢討與本地物業市場相關的風險後，香港金融管理局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來首次放寬住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎措施。此次放寬上升了大多數住宅按揭貸款以及物業發展和投資融資的貸款與價值比率上限。其後於2024年初，暫停了利率壓力測試要求。\n\n香港金融管理局對金融機構的監管一直與時並進。近期數年全球詐騙情況急劇增加，我們已大幅加強努力，透過推出一套全面的措施來對抗新型詐騙手法，以保障銀行客戶。這些措施包括加強銀行與執法機關之間的信息共享；加強對可疑交易的監控（包括執行即時詐騙監控以及收緊支付卡認證）；授權客戶對其支付卡擁有更多控制權；以及教育客戶並提高公眾對詐騙的意識，同時推出《反詐騙消費者保障憲章》，以及預先交易警示機制，在識別到較高風險的快速支付系統（FPS）交易時向用戶發出警告。\n\n鑑於創新及數碼銀行產品及服務的快速增長，香港金融管理局已與銀行業界合作，加強消費者及投資者保護，提升銀行的運作及網絡韌性，以及對系統性網絡事件的集體防禦能力。同時，所有主要銀行已大幅加強其應對及從具破壞性勒索軟件攻擊中復甦的能力。香港金融管理局與業界亦推動了不同消費者數據基礎設施項目，例如「信貸數據智」試驗計劃，以提升消費者信貸參考服務，並推動跨邊界信貸參考倡議，以便利企業進行跨境融資活動。\n\n當風險得到妥善管理時，金融科技和數字化可以帶來巨大的機會。藉較早於促進 Regtech 採用方面的成功，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）和保險業監管局的支持下，於2023年8月載有新的金融科技推動路線圖，以便推動金融機構在五個重點範疇—Wealthtech、Insurtech、Greentech、人工智能和分布式分類帳技術—進一步發展金融科技。我們預期本地監管機構將繼續合作，並在未來幾年內與其行業緊密合作，以便香港金融業整體能緊貼並把握多變的金融科技發展帶來的益處。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心：行動和創新的中心\n\n2023年，我們充分走出疫情陰霾。香港不僅回復了商業活動，而且在全球投資者回流及我們加強的全球網絡支持下，進一步鞏固了其作為世界領先國際金融中心之一的地位。在香港本地，我們接任香港金融管理局成立三十週年的機遇，主辦了一連串大量國際活動，並邀請全球金融與銀行界高層領導人參與，以展現香港的活力，並發出清晰信息：香港作為國際金融中心，對力求增長與創新之全球投資者及金融機構而言，仍然相關且不可或缺。尤其值得注意的是，11月舉行的全球金融領導人投資峰會吸引了來自約160家全球金融機構的超過350位國際及地區領導人來港參與。在香港舉辦的其他高級別活動包括巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（巴塞爾委員會）會議，以及兩場香港金融管理局與國際貨幣基金組織舉辦的會議，這些會議是當年規模最大的央行行長與銀行監督機構聚會之中。這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n對外而言，2023年亦是香港積極加強與包括美國及歐洲在內的傳統市場，以及中東等地新目的地的聯繫的一年。我們與這些市場的同級監管機構及全球金融機構高層管理人員達到，向他們介紹香港及內地的機會，同時力求為香港尋找新的合作機會。\n\n為配合這些聯繫努力，我們積極佔據國際及區域組織的工作，並擔任若干領導角色。在過去一年，我接受了主持主要新興市場經濟體中央銀行總裁會議及擔任金融穩定委員會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組聯席主席的邀請。我的同事亦擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會、金融行動特別工作小組以及東亞太平洋中央銀行高層會議等數字其他重要小組的主席或聯席主席等職務。香港金融管理局在多間區域及國際組織中展現領導力，是對香港在國際中央銀行及監管工作方面的專門知識和貢獻的肯定，以及對香港作為國際金融中心的重要性。\n\n為建立於上述成就之上，我們必須確立自身作為一個長遠的國際金融中心地位，保持前瞻立場以確保我們持續的競爭力。我們已識別出未來幾年將塑造我們未來的三大長期趨勢，即內地持續開放、綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及金融科技的應用。我們將繼續支持金融市場的發展，以把握這些長期趨勢帶來的機會，同時定位我們的金融平台，提供領先的服務以吸引更多業務來香港。有關我們在綠色及可持續金融方面的工作詳情，讀者可能參閱我們的《2023年可持續發展報告》。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and

2023年摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年呈現正面增長，隨着入境旅遊和本地需求復甦而推動。勞工市場隨着經濟復甦繼續改善，而通脹繼續維持溫和。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，雖然前景蒙上陰影，存在多個不明朗因素。\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年繼續健康，由雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝支持。資產質素維持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將維持高水平較長時間的情況下，港元於2023年大部分時間在貨幣發行局的疲弱兌換範圍內交易，弱方兌換承擔機制在2月中至5月初期間共觸發8次。港元匯兌及貨幣市場保持穩健，並繼續以暢順且有秩序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年標誌著掛鈎匯率制度的40周年。作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，掛鈎匯率制度幫助香港抵禦了過去四十年來的一系列震盪和危機，展現了該制度的韌性和穩健性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局迅速應對三月美國及歐洲的銀行業動盪，從管理其餘波至完成內部檢討，汲取經驗以供本地銀行業參考，同時維持其重點在於銀行的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加，以及對第三方提供的技術服務使用不斷增加，香港金融管理局亦與銀行緊密合作，以提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局提升支付卡的消費者保護，以及透過進一步修訂銀行行為守則與反詐騙消費者保護守則。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構工作，建立一個平衡的虛擬資產相關活動監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，引入提升措施至跨境理財通試點計劃，並開始監管信託業務。亦推出了名為「信貸數據智通」的消費者信貸參考服務試驗計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資方面的努力，展現了以風險為本的方式應對最高威脅的承諾。為應對增加的數位詐騙，香港金融管理局已加強生態系統合作，推出即時詐騙監測、提升銀行與執法機構之間的信息共享、加強公眾教育，以及在使用快速支付系統時推出新的交易前警報機制。與此同時，透過宏觀分析試點計劃，已先進監管科技能力。\n\n香港金融管理局在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率及披露，並在加強銀行業能力建設方面作出顯著努力。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推進其工作，以確保具信譽的決議機制，包括制定關於存取關鍵金融市場基礎設施的新決議標準，以及完成對吸納損失能力政策標準執行的審查。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n順利舉行第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會及香港金管局－銀行國際結算署高層次會議，展現全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局緊密合作，以深化和擴大香港與內地金融市場之間的互通互聯。這包括提升跨境財富管理互聯互通計劃，指定額外用於債券通南向交易的市場參與者，順利推出交換通北向交易，以及推出港幣人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台做價商計劃，所有這些舉措均有效鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色與可持續金融以及企業現金管理中心等範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續在「金融科技2025」策略的不同範疇取得重大進展。項目mBridge進入最小可行產品發展階段，電子港幣試點計劃第一階段已完成，商業數據交換見使用率增加，並順利與政府資料來源對接。此外，亦宣布了一項新的金融科技推廣路線圖，以進一步發展財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術於銀行業內。與此同時，快速支付系統迎來五周年，持續見到拓展應用及提升，包括與泰國PromptPay對接以實現跨境QR支付的新功能。在制定穩定幣發行者監管制度方面亦取得重大進展，並已載有諮詢文件以收集對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n儘管投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰，外匯基金仍取得港幣2,260億元的良好投資收益，標誌著投資回報率為5.5%。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續其資產多元化及負責任投資的努力。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來，錄得年化內部回報率11.8%。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過不同渠道與社區及市場維持積極聯繫，以推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n在內部，香港金融管理局致力於建立一支靈活應變且專業的員工隊伍，維持嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升數字化能力以適應變化，確保其政策和倡議的有效執行。"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

2024年工作重點及前瞻\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預期將繼續以溫和步伐復甦，受惠於持續的入境旅遊、公共基礎設施項目及穩健的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險與不明朗因素，加上與未來美國政策利率路徑、全球增長前景及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張相關的因素。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性及多年累積的充足緩衝，繼續處於有利位置以抵禦不利震盪。\n\n香港金融管理局對保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定賦予重大意義。展望，我們將繼續面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境，力求及時識別新興風險，並以靈活應變的方式應對。同時，我們將尋求機會，創造政策空間，協助進一步提升香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。在充滿挑戰的投資環境中管理貨幣發行基金，我們將繼續謹慎投資，保持靈活，鑑於情況採取適當的防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定與健全\n\n近年全球經濟的不明朗因素預期會持續至2024年。香港金融管理局將緊貼最新發展，並對潛在風險保持警惕，目標是維護金融體系的韌性和穩定，這對於支持香港經濟運作至關重要。\n\n# 提高警覺以應對潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策展望的不明朗因素、不斷演變的地緣政治風險以及不均勻的全球經濟復甦而出現波動。2024年亦是關鍵的選舉年，多間主要選舉定於世界各地舉行。這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性及多年來累積的緩衝，給予其應對不利震盪的能力。香港金融管理局亦具備能力、資源和承諾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續緊密監察國內外環境中出現的任何風險和弱點，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣和金融穩定。我們亦會進行研究，評估影響香港經濟的問題，並應對與這些問題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n在2023年，世界各地爆發新的地緣政治緊張，而其他緊張局勢維持未解，這對政治不確定性和不穩定作出貢獻，情況設立將持續至2024年。高利率形式的經濟壓力是全球經濟環境的特徵，而利率在進入2024年時仍維持高水準。內銀行業，持續朝數位化發展及執行新科技，包括人工智慧，帶來了許多優勢，亦帶來了新的營運及安全風險以及監管挑戰。在如此動盪的政治、經濟和科技環境下，香港金融管理局致力確保銀行具備承受震盪的能力，透過持續的監管努力。與此同時，我們將繼續提升和完善我們的銀行監管和規章框架及政策，鑑於科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準和最高實踐。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n鑑於日益充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的重點將放在監測授權機構（AIs）的資產質量，並評估其信貸風險管理與控制措施的有效性，尤其在貸款分類與撥備實務及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行及商業行業維持緊密對話，以確保AIs在經濟週期內，在進行審慎信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡。特別是，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟進銀行針對2024年3月推出的9項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景的不明朗因素以及升高的地緣政治緊張可能增加資產價格及跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金融管理局將高度重視謹慎，並繼續更有效監管AIs的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 跟進2023年銀行危機所汲取的經驗與行動\n\n香港金融管理局將推行其內部審查中確定的跟進行動，該審查是為應對2023年美國及歐洲的銀行動盪而進行的。這些行動將進一步加強監管有效性，並提升其處理銀行危機的能力，若出現此類情況。具體行動包括在金管局的監管審查過程中，加強對銀行賬簿中利率風險的風險捕捉；改善銀行在銀行服務繼續數字化的背景下，處理流動性壓力的準備；簡化金管局的危機管理流程；以及進一步加強跨機構和跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續監察銀行機構在達成全面符合金管局監管政策手冊（SPM）模組OR-2「運作韌性」方面的進展，並評估銀行對合理干擾的容忍限額，以提升整體銀行系統的韌性。就網絡風險方面，我們將監察銀行機構根據網絡韌性評估框架2.0進行一輪新的自我評估，並監察銀行機構執行安全的三重資料備份，以提升其在面對具破壞性的網絡攻擊時的資料復原能力。\n\n鑒於銀行業務數位化步伐不斷加快，香港金融管理局將保持緊密關注使用先進科技，例如生成式人工智能和分布式分類帳科技，所產生的潛在風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關持份者合作，運作一個靈活應變及具預見性的機制，以應對持續增長的數位詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 反洗錢與反恐融資\n\n於2024年，為維護銀行體系的健全並建立客戶信心，香港金融管理局將重點應對高風險範疇，優先進行風險為本的監管更新，包括發行指引以支持有效執行針對政治敏感人士要求的變更，以及支持穩定幣發行機構監管制度的執行。我們亦將發行指引，協助人工智能優化其交易監控系統，並推動人工智能的負責任使用，重點關注針對高層次洗錢活動的控制措施。為加強生態系統對數碼詐騙的應對，並減低對受害者的損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾及業界，就擴大銀行間資訊共享範疇，從企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶的建議進行磋商，並根據收到的反饋推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過匯集多個銀行與反洗錢相關的資料，並與現有生態系統詐騙分析系統整合，全面建立巨觀分析3.0。這將帶來更迅速的跨銀行應對能力，進一步提升我們數據驅動的反洗錢及反恐融資監管，讓我們能更快、更果斷地應對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關的業務\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局將加強對人工智能在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品、保險及強制性儲蓄計劃（MPF）相關業務的現場檢查及非現場監察。具體而言，我們將重點放在跨境財富管理通關（跨境WMC）業務、數位分銷及顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，鑑於最新市場發展以及不斷演進的國際標準。\n\n香港金融管理局將緊密溝通其他監管機構和銀行業，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售提供適當的指引。尤其為支持虛擬資產行業的可持續和負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府和其他監管機構工作，確保為虛擬資產行業制定的監管制度穩健、全面以及平衡。\n\n香港金融管理局將便利及監察業界執行跨境WMC的提升措施，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局溝通，以便進一步提升該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，以簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並適當整合及澄清指引，以便利業界合規。此外，除信託業務外，我們亦將開始根據《證券及期貨條例》監察為經證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）認可的集體投資計劃提供託管服務的新類型13受規管活動，該活動將於2024年10月2日開始運作。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n香港金融管理局旨在根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及支付與市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的不同指引，推動其監管下的金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全及效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI執行監察和評估，並參與其他國際小組商討新的FMI相關倡議。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並適當檢討和加強我們的監管要求，以反映最新的國際實務以及市場和科技發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續加強及完善其銀行監管框架及政策，鑑於國際標準和最高實踐。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n對《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR）的建議修訂，旨在實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package），預計於立法會通過修訂後的規則以下生效，時間為2025年1月1日。2024年，香港金融管理局將繼續準備支持規則申請所需的指引、銀行報表及標準披露表格，以便利規則的應用。尤其，我們計劃：\n- 於2024年第2季就SPM模組CA-B-3「逆周期資本緩衝（CCyB）– 私人部門信貸風險的地理分配」及回報MA(BS)25「逆周期資本緩衝季度報告」的修訂，諮詢業界，反映最終方案的執行及修訂國際銀行統計回報表所帶來的後續變更；以及\n- 完成落實新市場及信貸估值調整風險標準的僅報告要求方案，該方案將於2024年7月1日生效。\n\n那些條款與修訂後的銀行業規例下的最終方案執行相關的，銀行（限額）規則（BELR）及銀行（流動性）規則（BLR）的擬議修訂，亦預計於2025年1月1日生效。香港金融管理局計劃於2024年完成相關監管回報的擬議後續修訂。\n\n與此同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會分別於2022年12月及2023年12月發布了關於銀行加密資產風險審慎處理的新標準，以及對該標準的隨後針對性修訂。本地將於2025年執行該標準。香港金融管理局將審視是否需要對包括銀行資本規則（BCR）、銀行債務規則（BDR）、銀行流動性風險規則（BELR）和銀行流動性規則（BLR）在內的各種規則進行潛在的立法修訂，並於2025年上半年進行有關必要規則修訂的法定諮詢。\n\n#

{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introd

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introdu

公司治理\n\n作為香港的中央銀行機構，金管局致力於維持高標準的公司治理，因為良好的治理對維持及保護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任和信心至關重要。\n\n為取得其對良好企業管治的承諾，香港金融管理局：\n- 制定清晰的治理結構，並保持高度的問責程度；\n- 實施嚴謹的控制措施以管理風險，並確保各級員工行為及日常運作均符合指定標準；以及\n- 奉行高透明度和保持開放的政策，並與持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 香港金融管理局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n香港金融管理局是香港特別行政區政府的一部分，但能夠以與公務員不同的條件聘請員工，以便吸引具備適當經驗和專門知識的人員。香港金融管理局行政總裁及其員工均為公職人員。在其日常工作中，香港金融管理局在相關法定權力賦予或轉授貨幣管理局的範圍內，享有高度自主權。\n\n財政司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標和貨幣系統的結構：一封財政司長於2003年6月25日致香港金融管理局的信函，訂明這些應為維持在約港幣7.80兌一個美元的穩健匯率，由貨幣局安排維持。香港金融管理局自身負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括釐定實現該目標的策略、工具和營運手段。香港金融管理局亦有責任維持香港貨幣系統的健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系的穩定與健全，以及香港作為國際金融中心的地位。為支持這些政策，金管局的責任包括：\n-

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年錄得正面增長，歸功於入境旅遊和內需的復甦。勞動力市場隨着經濟復甦持續改善，而通脹維持溫和。在收緊的金融狀況下，資產市場維持疲弱，受疲弱的市場情緒影響。預期2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，雖然前景蒙上陰影，受到多個外部不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在應對去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟在2023年穩步增長3.2%（表1和圖1）。在對內方面，私人消費在勞動市場狀況改善及政府推出的不同支持措施（例如消費券計劃及一系列促銷活動）的推動下顯著復甦。儘管財務條件收緊，整體投資開支相較於去年低的比較基準錄得重大增長。對外方面，香港的服務出口因入境旅遊的雄厚復甦而回升。然而，其正面影響被服務貿易（衡量為服務進口）中強勁的出境旅遊復甦所抵銷。另一方面，商品出口在疲弱的外部需求下維持低迷，拖累香港的國內生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖1 實際GDP增長的貢獻\n資料來源：統計處\n\n表 1 按支出分項的實際國內生產總值增長率（逐季比較）\n註：季節性調整後的固定資本總形成總額的季對季變動率不可用。\n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2023年本地通貨膨脹維持溫和，外部價格壓力逐步緩解，儘管經濟復甦使國內成本壓力微升，但整體仍大致受控（圖2）1。2023全年，核心與整體通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n勞動市場情況在2023年進一步改善，失業率於7月降至近十年低位 的2.8%，其餘月份則徘徊於低水平（圖3）。勞動需求與勞動供應均上升，分別反映於總就業人數的上升（圖3）及勞動人口的增加。考慮到香港人力短缺的情況，政府於2023年推出了不同輸入勞工計劃及吸引人才措施。與此同時，面對緊的勞動市場情況，名義工資及勞動收入的年同比增長率逐步向疫情前水平上升。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況\n資料來源：統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n在2023年初穩定後，本地股市在第2屆轉為疲弱。延續2022年底的反彈，恆生指數於2023年1月27（1月27日）上升至全年高位22,689點。其後指數回落，並進一步下跌至12月低位（圖4），反映由於3月美國及瑞士銀行業問題，以及全球經濟前景轉弱和下半年金融條件收緊所導致的疲弱市場情緒。恆生指數以17,047點收市，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，標誌連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2023年首4項月份，因中國大陸及香港恢復復常而出現反彈，但其後隨着按揭利率上升和疲弱的市場情緒而回落。整體而言，2023年住宅價格較去年下跌6.9%，而住宅交易量進一步下跌4.5%，錄得43,002個單位，創歷史低點。儘管房屋可負擔性微升，但仍然維持緊張，連同房屋價格的下調。同樣，非住宅物業市場持續面對壓力，辦公室、零售舖位及廠房單位價格進一步回落。由於在家工作安排的增加和大量供應，辦公室租金持續處於高壓力之下。另一方面，隨著入境旅遊的復甦和私人物業消費的改善，零售舖位租金在2023年上升。\n\n圖4

經濟環境\n\n2024年，香港經濟預計將以溫和步伐繼續復甦。入境旅遊將隨着接待能力的持續改善及政府推動盛事的工作而進一步擴大，而本地消費活動則應受惠於穩定的勞動市場。政府將推進的不同基礎設施項目亦將為經濟提供支持。與此同時，香港的貨物出口可能隨着全球科技週期預期的回升而回穩。政府預測2024年實際GDP將穩步增長2.5%至3.5%。然而，前景因多個風險及不明朗因素而蒙上陰影，包括來自美國政策利率路徑、科技週期復甦步伐、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢等。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n本地通脹預期在2024年將維持溫和，外部價格壓力回落協助抵銷國內成本的向上壓力，在經濟進一步復甦及房屋租金上升的情況下。市場共識預測2024年的主要通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預測主要通脹率及核心通脹率分別為2.4%和1.7%。另一方面，勞動市場預期將受到持續經濟復甦的支持，不同勞工輸入及人才吸引計劃將繼續協助紓緩跨不同行業的人力短缺。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面對多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、美國及歐洲三月銀行危機引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及中國內地和香港經濟復甦較預期為慢。儘管面對這些多個不利因素，香港銀行業仍維持健康，並持續受到雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝支持。儘管分類貸款比率有所增加，銀行業的資產質素仍維持健康。銀行的盈利能力顯著改善，這是由於較高淨利息收入所推動。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n銀行業的分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦由0.85%增加至1.24%（圖5）。與內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率亦由2022年底的2.26%上升至2023年底的2.58%。分類貸款比率的增加主要由於對內地房地產開發商風險敞口的下調（評級）。然而，銀行設立的撥備維持足夠。截至2023年底，撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與分類貸款的比率）為75%。若考慮到分類貸款所擔保的抵押品市場價值，經調整的撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。與此同時，截至2023年底，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率分別為0.08%及0.30%，維持低水平（圖6）。\n\n圖5

盈利趨勢\n\n銀行業於2023年錄得顯著的盈利增長。零售銀行在該年的總體稅前經營利潤上升了62.1%，而稅後平均資產回報率則從去年的0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。盈利的改善主要源於淨利息收入的增加（+30%），以及2023年持作交易投資的重大收益，相比去年溫和的虧損。此情況部分被貸款減值損失的增加（+28%）所抵銷，因為針對新增不良貸款已設立特定撥備。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息率在2023年擴大至1.68%，較一年前的1.31%有所增加（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行的成本收入比從2022年的48.0%下降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the

貨幣穩定性\n\n在2023年，在市場預期美國政策利率將「高」且「較長時間」的情況下，港元大部分時間在可兌換範圍的「疲弱」側「交易」，「自」2月中至5月「初」，「弱」側兌換承擔機制被「觸發」了「8」次。「自」5月起，港元已「回升」部分動力，並在「年底」約於7.8的中心價位「交易」。在標誌其「40周年」紀念的「掛鈎」匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息率「更廣泛層面」地追蹤其美元「有關當局」，同時「亦」受本地供求影響。「整體」而言，港元匯率及貨幣市場「維持」「穩健」，「交易」「暢順」且「有秩序」。作為香港貨幣及金融「穩定」的「基石」，「連結」匯率制度已多次「體現」其對「不同」外部「震盪」的強大韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元兌美元在外匯市場的穩定外匯價值，其匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元內。貨幣系統的結構採用貨幣局安排，要求貨幣基地至少有100%的美元儲備作支持，且貨幣基地的變動必須與相應的美元儲備變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務憑證，為三家發行紙幣銀行所發行紙幣提供全面支持；\n- 政府發行並在市面上流通的貨幣紙幣及硬幣；\n- 香港金融管理局（金管局）的結算帳戶制衡總額，即其所設的結算帳戶餘額總和；以及\n- 香港金融管理局代表政府發行的貨幣發行基金票據及紙幣（EFBNs）。\n\n透過自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的承諾，維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或疲弱方）CU被觸發時，香港金融管理局準備於要求時，以每美元7.75港元（或7.85港元）向銀行沽出（或從銀行買入）港元，總餘額將擴大（或收縮），以壓低（或提高）港元利率，協助將港元回復至7.75至7.85的可兌換範圍內。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n在市場對美國政策利率將維持高位較長時間的預期下，香港元在2023年貫穿全年大部分時間維持疲弱，主要交易於聯繫匯率範圍的弱方。弱方觸發達8次，時間從2月中至5月初。香港元匯率在5月初至7月期間回升，部分原因是上市公司的派發需求以及企業年底資金需求推動。此後，香港元主要受到本地資金需求的變化所推動，例如透過南向證券通的買入資金流，並在年底交易於約7.8的中央價位附近（圖1）。整體而言，香港元匯率市場在2023年持續正常運作。\n\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n\n二月至五月，香港金融管理局根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，應銀行要求，在疲弱方買入總額為515億港元。反映觸發了疲弱方，餘額總計由2022年底的963億港元減少至2023年底的450億港元。與此同時，未償還的EFBNs於全年內微升，由12,004億港元上升至12,455億港元。因此，餘額總計與未償還EFBNs總額由2022年底的12,967億港元下跌至2023年底的12,904億港元（圖2）。貨幣基地全年維持充分由外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖2 總餘額（貼現窗口前）及2023年未償還外匯基金證券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBORs）通常與美元利率同步變動。由於美國在2023年頭七個月持續上調利率，HIBORs也因此上升（圖3）。全年而言，隔夜、1個月及3個月HIBORs分別上升286、92及16個基點，至年底分別為6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n以下美國聯邦資金利率目標範圍增設後，基地利率經調整上調四項，總計一個百分點（即100個基點），由4.75%上升至5.75%。1 在零售方面，以下美國政策利率上調，多間銀行於初將最高貸款利率上調12.5個基點，並於年底再上調另12.5個基點。部分銀行亦於本年內提高新核准按揭貸款的HIBOR基於按揭利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的資金市場持續正常運作。貼現窗口貸款上升至2023年的388億港元，較2022年的84億港元增加，相關使用率未見異常。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行同業拆息率\n\n# 掛鈎匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）在過去4項十年中一直是香港金融體系的雄厚支柱，並體現其強大與韌性以應對挑戰。儘管持續存在美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦的不明朗因素，香港美元匯率及資金市場仍持續以有秩序的方式運作，反映LERS的穩健性。政府堅決支持LERS。在其2023年外部部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，LERS的可信性已透過一套透明的規則、大量財政及外匯儲備、雄厚的金融監管及監督、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政框架確保。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港銀行業持續運作暢順，流動性狀況以及資本充足率表現以及在國際標準下。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管努力。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已從發行基金資產中配置特定部分用以支持貨幣基地。後備比率（定義為後備資產劃分貨幣基地）由2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的高位112.71%，超過了112.5%的上觸發水平（圖4）。這反映了因今年上半年啟動疲弱側CU所導致的總結餘收縮的結果。根據發行基金顧問委員會核准的安排，並因債務憑證的贖回，資產已從後備組合轉移至投資組合，以將後備比率減低至2023年5月8日約109.97%。其後，後備比率穩步上升，於12月31日收市為110.73%。根據LERS，雖然已指定特定發行基金資產用於後備組合，但所有發行基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。發行基金充足的財政資源，加上健康的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的支持。\n\n圖4

貨幣局小組委員會\n\n香港金融管理局外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行局子委員會（CBC）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2023年，子委員會審議了包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩潰、聯邦儲備系統向香港銀行提供美元流動性支持措施的傳導，以及近期港元利率的近期波動。子委員會就這些問題的討論錄得，以及提交予子委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告均載於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n#

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年儘管面對多個挑戰，包括三月美國及歐洲的銀行風波、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢，仍維持雄厚且具韌性。香港金管局迅速應對三月的銀行風波——從管理漣漪效應到完成內部審查（涵蓋監管程序和解決框架等範疇），汲取經驗，同時維持對持牌金融機構信貸、流動性及市場風險管理的重點。鑑於網絡威脅增加，以及第三方提供技術服務的使用增加，香港金管局亦與持牌金融機構緊密合作，提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局提升支付卡方面的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂銀行行為守則以及推出反詐騙消費者保護憲章。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，建立平衡的虛擬資產相關活動監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，推出跨境財富管理通證試點計劃的提升措施，並開始監管信託業務。為準備提供「信貸數據智庫」下的消費者信貸參考服務，推出試點計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力，展現了以風險為本的方式應對最高威脅的承諾。為應對增加的數碼詐騙，金管局已透過推出實時欺詐監測及拓寬公私部門信息分享合作，加強了生態系統合作，包括詐騙及洗錢情報工作組。推出一個突破性的平台以便利銀行間信息分享，將有助於應對詐騙帳戶網絡的風險，而金管局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理增加的與詐騙相關銀行投訴，並上調公眾對不同詐騙手法的意識，包括在使用快速支付系統時的交易前警報機制。與此同時，亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃先進了監管科技能力。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露要求。亦在加強銀行業能力建設、吸引和培育未來人才以及提升現有專業人員技能方面作出顯著努力。此外，香港存款保障局已完成就建議提升存款保障計劃的公眾諮詢。\n\n香港金融管理局持續推動其工作，以確保可信的解決機制。制定與接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決標準，並完成對實施吸收損失能力政策標準經驗的檢視。在與銀行進行解決計劃時，取得重大進展，以應對早期終止風險及運作的連續性。香港金融管理局亦持續積極參與國際政策倡議及區域合作，以推動解決事宜。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的普遍目標是推動銀行系統的安全與穩定。達成此目標有賴於具極高韌性的金融體系，該體系能提供香港經濟需求的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可以透過其業務的**方式**，**影響**系統的穩定性，在極端**情況**下，更可能以**失序**的**方式**失敗。**貨幣當局**作為監管機構，**擔當****保護**金融穩定的關鍵角色，透過**確保**銀行**具韌性**以應對**震盪**，並**能夠**在**危機**中**復甦**其**狀況**，最終**協助**預防失敗。**貨幣當局**負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責**認可**香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構**統稱**認可機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣管理局作為解決機構，旨在確保在人工智能機構變得不可持續經營時，其倒閉可以有秩序地管理。為此，香港已建立一套針對金融機構的解決機制，其中貨幣管理局為人工智能機構及其他類別機構的解決機構。為落實香港的解決機制，重要的是制定解決規則及政策標準，進行解決計劃以消除對人工智能機構可解決性的阻礙，並發展貨幣管理局處理失敗人工智能機構的運作能力。為更有效執行這些工作，貨幣管理局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n貨幣管理局亦負責若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監察。監察金融市場基礎設施時，金管局推動其普遍安全及效率，限制系統性風險並促進透明度。制定更具韌性的金融市場基礎設施，可保障香港的貨幣及金融系統免受金融危機可能產生的破壞性影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n在本年內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）向兩間在香港境外註冊的銀行授予一個銀行牌照及一個限制性銀行牌照。香港金融管理局亦向四項外國交易平台營運商授予貨幣經紀批准，並撤銷另一個授予一個貨幣經紀的批准。香港金融管理局在本年內撤銷五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n更多關於人工智能及香港本地代表機構的資料，請查閱附錄及表格D至F，分別於第313至316頁和第322至325頁查閱。\n\n# 三層銀行體系評估\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了一項全面檢討香港的三層銀行體系，以便簡化香港銀行體系的結構。檢討結果查閱到，三層體系已變得比必要的複雜，以致無法取得原來的目標，即在進入銀行體系的靈活性與保護小型存款人之間取得平衡。其後，香港金融管理局於6月開始為期三個月的諮詢，就將三層銀行體系簡化為兩層的建議進行磋商，透過將吸收存款公司併入受限制牌照銀行部門，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第二層。回應者普遍表示支持該建議。\n\n# 監督活動概述\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了177次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛種類的議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理及風險管理。作為香港金融管理局持續推動更強風險治理努力的部分，與授權機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，香港金融管理局、授權機構及其外部核數師之中舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了現場活動外，香港金融管理局進行了對廣泛種類金融機構人工智能活動的定期審查。給予信用風險管理重點關注，因為在高利率環境下，以及部分內地房地產開發商出現債務違約，信貸風險環境充滿挑戰。隨著金融機構應用科技的趨勢進一步加速，營運風險和科技風險的管理亦是另一個重點。香港金融管理局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的工作，並推出一輪以氣候相關風險治理為重點的主題審查，以及一連串諮詢環節，以提供監管指引。\n\n自2023年3月開始的美國及歐洲銀行危機，就規模和範圍而言，是自2008年重大金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在危機發展期間保持高警惕狀態，並採取一系列預防性行動，以確保任何潛在後果不會影響本地銀行及金融體系的信心。事件後，HKMA進行內部檢討，顧及從危機中獲得的觀察和經驗。基於此檢討，HKMA制定詳細行動計劃，納入所學經驗，以加強監管有效性，並提升處理銀行危機的能力。詳情請參閱第95頁的流動性及市場風險方面，了解HKMA在此方面的工作。\n\n在監管進行方面，香港金融管理局對證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務以及消費者保護事項進行現場檢查，並配合針對評估為較高風險或新措施的範疇進行主題性審查。\n\n表1載有香港金融管理局2023年的監管活動概要。\n\n表 1 監督活動概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款減少3.6%，相比2022年的下跌3.0%。表2列明貸款和推進的分項。與內地相關的貸款在2023年減少6.6%至4,226億港元（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款及推進的增長\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局加強監管努力，給予高利率環境及內地房地產市場持續疲弱的狀況，密切監測人工智能機構的資產質量，並評估其信貸風險管理實務。銀行業的資產質量在該年惡化，但維持可控。截至2023年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率則由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n在本年，香港金融管理局進行了針對性及主題性的檢查，以評估認可金融機構的信貸風險管理，重點關注對易受影響行業的風險敞口、保費融資、對香港以外業務的信貸風險監管，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶所面臨的現金流壓力。\n\n香港金融管理局與銀行業中小企業（中）貸款協調機制於七月宣布開始有秩序地退出「預先核准本金還款寬限期計劃」。該計劃於二零二零年五月推出，旨在協助合資格企業渡過疫情。鑑於商業行業的意見，部分本金還款選項已提升，以協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。儘管疫情已到年底，若個別行業或借款人仍然面對挑戰，銀行將持續按案例提供本金延期或其他合適的信貸舒緩措施。\n\n香港金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與該計劃但因個別情況而面對現金流壓力的企業之資金需求時，應表現同理心。香港金融管理局提醒銀行在交易遇到償還問題的企業時，應跟隨「香港企業困難處理方法」的指引，使個別銀行能在貸款人的共同利益下行事。\n\n# 不動產按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局推出的多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已加強銀行對房地產按揭貸款業務的風險管理，以及銀行業應對樓價大幅下跌所帶來的挑戰的能力。2023年核准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與樓價比率維持在57%，相比2009年9月首次推出逆周期措施之前的64%（圖1）。2023年新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率維持在40%，相比2010年8月首次應用供款與入息比率上限時的41%。\n\n7月7日，香港金融管理局（HKMA）鑑於物業價格、交易量以及本地和外部經濟環境等因素，經調整逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是自2009年推出住宅物業逆周期宏觀審慎措施以來首次放寬有關措施。調整內容包括增加住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款與價值比率，以及基於抵押貸款申請人淨資產評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款與價值比率。此外，取消了對主要收入來自香港以外地方的按揭申請人，降低適用的最高貸款與價值比率及供款與入息比率限額10個百分點的要求。香港金融管理局亦取消了當按揭申請人的總按揭融資超出香港金融管理局正常可接受的貸款與價值比率上限20個百分點時，需對適用的供款與入息比率限額減去五個百分點的要求。\n\n圖1

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局採用多管齊下的方法，取得顯著進展，以鞏固香港作為全球競爭力的國際金融中心地位。\n\n兩項重大活動的成功，即全球財務領導人投資峰會及香港金管局與BIS的高層次會議，強化了香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並產生正面漣漪效應。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局取得努力，以深化和擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。此舉刊載於廣東港澳大灣區跨境財富管理連通計劃的提升，指定額外做市商於債券通南向交易，順利推出互換通北向交易，以及推出港幣人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市計劃。這些舉措有效加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的門戶地位。\n\n香港金管局亦取得良好進展，加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續金融，以及企業財務中心等範疇。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金管局加強了對海外及內地持份者的市場推廣活動，以保持他們了解香港金融市場的機會及其韌性。\n\n已取得重大進展，香港金管局「金融科技2025」策略在所有範疇均有推進，包括推動金融科技應用、中央銀行數字貨幣、數據基礎設施、人才發展，以及政策和資金支持。\n\n快速支付系統（FPS）於九月迎來五周年。註冊數字穩步增長，並在2023年底達到13.6百萬。該系統全年平均每日成交額上升至1.25百萬筆即時交易。FPS x PromptPay 連結於12月與泰國央行聯合推出香港與泰國之間的跨境QR支付服務，為往來兩地方的人民提供快速、安全且方便的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n作為多間國際及地區性中央銀行和監管組織的成員，香港金融管理局持續為維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展的努力作出貢獻。\n\n# 概述\n\n貫穿全年，香港金管局持續加強努力，以加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在11月，金管局舉辦了第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會。這項為期三天的活動帶來了來自世界各地的知名金融領導人，分享他們獨特的視野，主題為「擁抱複雜性」。峰會吸引了來自160個國際金融機構的350名參加者，清楚地顯示了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。同月，香港金管局與國際清算銀行（BIS）共同舉辦了金管局-BIS高層會議，吸引了超過300名參加者，包括20位現任及前中央銀行總裁。會議突出了香港金管局與BIS以及國際中央銀行界的緊密合作。\n\n內地與香港通關計劃的擴展及提升，已加強香港作為內地與國際金融市場橋樑的角色。為便利跨境零售投資於廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA），一連串針對跨境財富管理通關計劃（跨境WMC）的提升已推出。借助南向債券通的暢順運作，香港金融管理局指定9名額外做市商，以改善二級流動性並符合投資者需求。今年成功推出北向交易的Swap Connect，讓全球投資者透過香港更好管理其內地固定收益投資組合相關的利率風險。\n\n香港的離岸人民幣業務在該年見證了強勁增長。香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及香港交易所（HKEX）合作，於6月推出港幣-人民幣雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市商計劃。這有助於發展香港更多元化的等值人民幣產品種類，促進在香港發行及交易等值人民幣股份。\n\n香港金融管理局持續加強香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其為提升香港作為優先選擇的資產管理中心的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業緊密合作，提供更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新方面亦取得重大進展，並鞏固香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位。同時，香港金融管理局亦加強市場拓展活動，向海外及內地相關人士推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n香港金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略1，以推動金融科技的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。本年度重點刊載於：\n- 推動在財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳（DLT）等科技重點範疇的進一步應用；\n- 推進有關批發央行數字貨幣（CBDC）的工作，以改善跨境支付；\n- 在研究在香港推出零售CBDC（即e-HKD）前景方面取得進一步進展；\n- 加強發展商業數據交換（CDI）；\n- 加強人才發展；\n- 透過資金和政策培育金融科技生態系統；\n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；以及\n- 拓寬快速支付系統（FPS）的應用。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，對維持香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2023年，4項銀行間即時全額結算（RTGS）系統、中央結算系統（CMU）及香港交易存管處（HKTR）實現了100%系統可用性，超越99.95%的目標。債務證券結算服務，包括北向及南向債券通對接服務，持續暢順運作。\n\nFPS 的應用持續增加，標誌著 FPS 達成五周年的重大里程碑。過去五年間，FPS 的註冊數字及成交額持續增長，截至 2023 年年底，註冊數字已增長至 13.6 百萬，而全年的平均每日成交額較 2022 年上升 33%。FPS 在處理政府帳單、商戶付款以及為儲值服務 (SVF) 電子錢包或銀行賬戶充值的應用增加，是交易量持續上升的關鍵驅動因素，加上個人對個人及商業付款的穩定增長。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的**安全**及**效率**，香港金融管理局監管**六**項**指定**零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監督17間持牌儲值支付工具發行機構（SVFs），其中**4項**為由持牌銀行發行的SVFs。本**年**，香港金融管理局**亦****持續****便利**政府消費券計劃的**暢順****執行**，**協助****協調****相關**政府**第三方**及為該計劃**委任**的SVF持牌機構，並促進他們之間的對話與合作。\n\n27（1月27日）12月，金融服務及庫務局與香港金融管理局（HKMA）聯合發佈了一份有關穩定幣發行機構監管的公開諮詢文件。其後，HKMA於2024年3月12日推出沙盒安排，針對有意在香港發行法幣掛鉤穩定幣的機構。同時，HKMA亦積極參與國際機構在加密資產活動方面的工作，並緊密監測市場的發展。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局（HKMA）維持積極參與中央銀行界，並持續在多個區域以及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。現正，HKMA共同擔任巴塞爾銀行監督委員會（巴塞爾委員會）政策與標準小組主席，亦擔任亞洲區域諮詢小組、非銀行監測專家小組（至6月）以及金融穩定理事會（FSB）金融創新網絡主席。HKMA亦擔任國際結算銀行（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體央行總裁會議主席。2018年至2023年間，HKMA連續擔任東亞太平洋央行總裁會議（EMEAP）下建立的金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融管理局亦於五月及七月分別與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及沙特阿拉伯中央銀行舉行會議，以推動中東與亞洲之間的投資及金融市場互聯互通。第六次香港-瑞士金融對話於九月二十五日在瑞士伯爾尼舉行，討論的題目涵蓋區域及國內展望、政策挑戰、最新發展，以及在可持續金融、金融科技和市場互聯互通範疇內的潛在合作。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023.\n\nSee pages 205 to 311 for the audited 2023 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the

儲備管理\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。雖然美國和歐洲的一些銀行在年初出現流動性問題，但相關風險並未跨越金融市場蔓延。儘管主要發達經濟體的通脹水平自2023年高位下跌，但仍維持在主要央行設立的目標之上。在經歷一輪進取的加息週期後，美國聯邦儲備局自第三季起暫停加息，並表示政策利率可能已接近或達到高位。這一點，加上美國經濟具韌性，使投資者情緒更加樂觀。然而，持續的地緣政治緊張局勢，例如俄烏戰爭以及當年年中中東地區衝突的爆發，為投資市場新增了波動和不明朗因素。在這個複雜且多變的投資環境中，滙兌基金的投資表現出現了一些起伏。儘管如此，滙兌基金仍取得良好投資回報。2023年，滙兌基金錄得港幣2,260億元的投資收益，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n交換基金的主要目標，如《交換基金條例》所制定，是影響香港貨幣的匯兌價值，無論是直接或間接的方式。該基金亦可能運用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以便協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局在財政司司長轉授的權力範圍內，負責向財政司司長報告交換基金的使用及投資管理事宜。\n\n# 交換基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會已設立外匯基金的以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基地在任何次均充分由極高流通性的美元等值資產支持；\n(iii) 確保足夠的流動性可用於維持貨幣和金融穩定之目的；以及\n(iv) 受(i)–(iii)限制，取得投資回報以協助保障Exchange Fund的長期購買力量。\n\n這些目標採取全面考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並納入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 交易所基金的投資組合分類\n\n廣義而言，發行基金擁有兩大投資組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有極高流通性的美元資產，以提供全面支持予貨幣基礎，符合貨幣局制度的要求。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券及股權市場，以保障資產價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局以審慎且循序漸進的方式，將香港外匯基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的資產類別。這些包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別一起釐定，受審慎風險管理原則和組合多元化策略的限制。\n\n策略投資組合於2007年建立，持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的策略目的購入。 鑒於其特殊性，策略投資組合不在基金投資表現的評估範圍之內。\n\n# 交換基金的投資\n\n聯匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金和法定機構的資金調度。利率更廣泛層面掛鈎於投資組合1的表現。一個主要個別例子是未來基金2，其利率根據投資組合配置與投資組合及LTGP的回報掛鈎。2023年，未來基金2的投資組合配置比例為投資組合與LTGP約35：65。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n香港儲備基金的投資過程以兩類資產配置的決定為基礎：戰略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表基於香港儲備基金投資目標的長期配置。以戰略性配置為指引，資產會進行戰術性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰術偏差」。雖然基準與循跡誤差3的限額由財政司長與儲備基金諮詢委員會磋商後釐定，但戰術性決策及戰術偏差的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局在轉授權力下設立。在容許的戰術偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可能管理狀況以採取短期市場走勢的優勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的交換基金投資辦事處專責管理交換基金的投資及相關風險管理功能。交換基金投資辦事處的成員直接管理約71%的交換基金投資，包括整體BP及部分IP。由內部管理的IP部分包括設立的一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及不同衍生工具投資組合，實施宏觀風險管理策略，以管理基金的風險。\n\n# 使用外部管理人員\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦僱用外部基金管理機構管理約29%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股本組合及其他專門資產類別。聘請外部管理機構的目的是汲取市場上最佳的投資專門知識，以獲取可持續回報，同時亦可汲取多元化且互補的投資方式，並善用外部市場的見解及專門投資知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易費用，以及扣繳及其他稅項。此支出主要由市場因素釐定，可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境越見複雜，良好的風險管理日益重要。香港金融管理局為其內部及對外管理的投資組合設定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並確保已妥善建立風險監察及合規制度。為推行與投資相關活動的有效風險管理及治理，已設立三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及操作風險）定期監察。風險管理過程支持香港金融管理局的戰略規劃及投資多元化努力。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局相信，適當強調負責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，可協助取得交換基金的投資目標，以及減低其基礎投資所涉及的環境、社會及治理（ESG）相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資實踐，香港金融管理局已將 ESG 因素併入交換基金的投資流程，其指導性原則為，若 ESG 投資的長期經調整回報與其他投資相若，則會給予 ESG 投資優先。如欲了解更多關於香港金融管理局負責任投資工作的詳情，請參閱《可持續發展報告 2023》中的「責任投資」章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2023年金融市場\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。\n\n全球股市大致上在2023年呈現向上趨勢。標準普爾500指數年上升24%，尤其在第四季，市場開始預期比預期更快減息。\n\n在債券市場，收益率維持高水平，10年期美國國債收益率一度突破5%，達到自2007年以來的最高水平。然而，隨著市場對各國央行貨幣政策的預期改變，債券收益率朝年底回落，隨着債券價格的逐步增加。\n\n在外匯市場中，美元對主要貨幣的表現不一。其中，英鎊和歐元對美元升值，而日圓和人民幣貶值。\n\n2023年主要貨幣、債券及股權市場的表現體現在表1中。\n\n表

To promote public understanding of its policies and operations, the HKMA communicates actively with the community and market participants through traditional and social media, the HKMA website, the Information Centre and other channels.\n\nInternally, the HKMA is striving to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline, and upgrade its digital capabilities in order to adapt to changes and ensure its policies and initiatives are effectively implemented.\n\n# Transparency\n\n# Media relations and use of social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and operations. In 2023, the HKMA held or participated in 188 open press events, comprising 11 press conferences, six media briefings, 15 stand-up interviews and 156 other public functions.

Topics included anti-scam initiatives, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\nMedia representatives were active participants in events organised by the HKMA in 2023, in particular the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. The three-day event generated over 2,000 pieces of positive, factual news coverage in local, Mainland and international media.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive, speaks at a media stand-up at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2023\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive, conducts a media stand-up at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit\n\nMr Arthur Yuen (first from right), Deputy Chief Executive, hosts a sharing session at the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter event\n\nMr Howard Lee (centre), Deputy Chief Executive, hosts a media briefing on the e-HKD Pilot Programme Phase 1 Report\n\nMr Darryl Chan (first from left), Deputy Chief Executive, moderates a panel discussion at the Treasury Markets Summit 2023\n\nCreative social media content helps to raise public awareness on the HKMA initiatives and a range of other topics\n\nTo engage with the public more effectively, the HKMA operates six social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, WeChat, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube), which collectively have over 150,000 followers. The HKMA’s major summit and conferences, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are livestreamed on its social media channels to enhance participation by the public and the industry. The HKMA also develops creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives. Recent content covered topics such as consumer protection and scam prevention, the Faster Payment System, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and major events of the HKMA.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for the public looking to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Public Enquiry Service handled 9,565 enquiries. About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins. Some of the common subjects of enquiries concerned banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received by the Public Enquiry Service since 2020, and Chart 2 provides a breakdown of the nature of enquiries received in 2023.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023\n\n# Publications\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published its Annual Report 2022 along with its first standalone Sustainability Report 2022. The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

交易所基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 財政司長\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審核外匯基金及其子公司（「該集團」）於第211至311頁所載的財務報表，包括外匯基金及該集團於2023年12月31日的資產負債表，以及其收入支出賬目、綜合收入表、權益變動表及現金流量表，並包括財務報表附註，包括重要的會計政策資訊。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實及公允地反映了基金及小組於2023年12月31日的財務地位，以及截至該年止的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）編製，且已根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7章行政長官指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7章取得的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行了我的審計。我在這些標準下的職責進一步說明於我報告書中「審計師對財務報表審計的職責」一章。根據這些標準，我與該小組保持獨立，並已履行我的其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，提供我意見的依據。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我對截至2023年12月31日止年度財務報表進行審計時，根據我的專業判斷，對審計結果最重要的事項。這些事項在審計全年財務報表的背景下已獲解決，並在形成我的意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資料。其他資料包含刊載於香港金融管理局2023年年度報告中的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未就此作任何形式的舉行。\n\n與我審計財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並評估其是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中獲得的知識存在重大不符。基於我的工作，如果我認為該等資訊存在重大錯誤，我必須報告此事實。我在此沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《發行基金條例》第7章行政長官發出的指示，準備財務報表，以提供真實及公允的觀點。此外，管理局負責建立其認為必要的內部控制，以使財務報表免於因詐欺或錯誤而產生的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本小組繼續經營的能力，根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n證券交易所基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監察該小組的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表全年是否不存在重大錯報，無論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包括我意見的審計報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但並非保證根據審計委員會審計準則進行的審計，一直能發現存在的重大錯報。錯報可能出現於舞弊或錯誤，如果個別或總體而言，可能合理地影響使用者根據這些財務報表所做出的經濟決定，則被視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計標準進行審計的部分，我運用專業判斷，並貫穿審計過程維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n識別並評估財務報表中重大誤報的風險，無論是由於詐欺或錯誤所致，設計並執行回應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能偵測出因詐欺所致的重大誤報的風險，較因錯誤所致的重大誤報的風險較高，因為詐欺可能涉及共謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制；\n取得有關審計的內部控制的了解，以便設計適當的審計程序，但並非為表達對小組內部控制有效性意見之目的；\n評估所運用會計政策的適當性及會計估計與相關揭露的合理性；\n結論小組採用持續經營基礎會計的適當性，並基於取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對小組持續經營的能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我結論認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在審計報告中引起對財務報表中相關揭露的注意，或若這些揭露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至我審計報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致小組無法繼續持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構與內容，包括揭露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允呈現的方式反映基礎交易與事件；以及\n取得有關小組內實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且適當審計證據，以表達對財務報表的意見。我負責小組審計的指導、監督與執行。我對我的審計意見負有獨自責任。\n\n我與聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核小組溝通，關於審計的計劃範圍及時間安排，以及重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向匯換基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供聲明，證明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用的情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會的聯繫中所獲得的資訊，我確定在本期間財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，因此這些即為關鍵審計事項。除非法例禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為在報告中說明該事項的不利後果，合理預期會超過對公眾利益的裨益，否則我會在審計師報告中闡述這些事項。\n\n林志源教授\n審計總監\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司轉授的權限，作為發行基金的主管，根據《發行基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理該基金。基金的主要活動是保護香港貨幣的兌換價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定和健全。\n\n基金的資產由4項投資組合管理：支持投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合和策略投資組合。支持投資組合的資產充分匹配香港貨幣發行局體系下的貨幣基地。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司購入的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的購入。相關經營分部資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 二 重大會計政策\n\n# 2.1% 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表是根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs為一統稱，包括所有適用的個別HKFRSs、香港會計準則及香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的解釋，以及在香港更廣泛層面被接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬機構（合稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策如下所述。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新或修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次於本集團當前會計期間有效或可用於初應用。附註3規定了因初步應用這些發展而導致的會計政策變更（如有），且這些變更與本集團當前及以前會計期間相關，並反映於這些財務報表中。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表以及集團在聯營公司和合資企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合資企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n財務報表的編製所**運用**的計量基礎為歷史成本，除非**以下**資產及負債是以公允價值計量：\n- 衍生金融工具（**附註** 2.6）；\n- 以公允價值透過損益帳戶計量的金融資產及金融負債（**附註** 2.6）；\n- 以公允價值透過其他綜合收益計量的金融資產（**附註** 2.6）；\n- 黃金（**附註** 2.10）；以及\n- 投資性不動產（**附註** 2.11）。\n\n遵照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的申請以及資產、負債、收入及開支的報告數字。這些估計及相關假設基於過往經驗及不同其他因素，而這些因素被認為在當時情況下是合理的，其結果構成了制定資產及負債賬面價值判斷的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非能從其他資料來源顯而易見。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續檢討。會計估計的修訂若僅影響該期間，則應在該期間確認；若修訂同時影響當期及未來期間，則應在修訂期間及未來期間確認。\n\n管理層在應用香港財務報告準則時所作的判斷，若對財務報表有重大影響，以及估計不確定性的主要資料來源，均於附註2.18中披露。\n\n若干比較數字已重新表述，以符合集團財務報表當年列示方式。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是由小組控制的實體。小組在因參與該實體而有機會獲得變動報酬，或擁有相關權利時，若能透過對該實體的力量影響這些報酬，即表示小組控制該實體。評估小組是否具備力量時，僅考慮實質權利（由小組及第三方持有）。\n"}
