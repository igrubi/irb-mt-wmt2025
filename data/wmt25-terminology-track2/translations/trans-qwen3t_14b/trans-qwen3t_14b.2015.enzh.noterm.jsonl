Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年增長放緩，反映內需較弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長將在嚴峻的外部環境及脆弱的金融市場情況下保持溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港本年度經濟增長有所放緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長降至2.4%，較2014年的2.6%有所下降（表1）。這反映出本地需求擴張趨於溫和，儘管淨出口重新成為GDP增長的正面貢獻因素，因總進口量下降速度超過總出口量（圖表1）。儘管經濟表現相對平平，勞動市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低水平。通脹進一步緩和，因內地成本及進口價格壓力持續減輕。本地股市在國際金融市場波動加劇的背景下出現大幅波動。住宅物業市場在二月第七輪審慎措施公布後開始轉趨平穩，至年底樓價進一步顯示出盤整跡象。\n\n圖表1 按貢獻分類的實際國內生產總值增長 來源：統計處。\n\n表1 按支出項目分實際國內生產總值增長（環比）\n\n註：經季節性調整的季度間變動率國內總體固定資本形成數據目前尚無。  \n來源：統計及普查局。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣政策方面，2015年匯率保持穩定，港元兌美元匯率維持在約7.75水平。由於股權相關資金流入，強方兌換責任於4月被觸發，9月及10月再度啟動，反映離岸人民幣兌換為港元及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總結餘擴大，本地利率持續保持低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率則在美國於12月中加息後上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求放緩，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降。銀行業整體貸款質素略有惡化，但分類貸款比率仍處於低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年國內需求增速放緩。儘管整體就業與收入狀況持續提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱與資產價格修正拖累下半年私人消費增長。然而，由於上半年較強的增長動能，全年私人消費增速從2014年的3.3%提升至4.8%。政府消費則以3.4%的增速小幅加快。事實上，國內需求增速放緩主要由於國內固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（圖表2）。私人部門機械設備購置連續第二年下滑，企業信心惡化，建築與工程活動也因公共工程進展較慢而呈現較弱的增長動能。\n\n#外部需求\n\n香港2015年的出口表現惡化（圖表3）。貨品出口錄得全面1.7%的下跌，為自2009年以來首次。對日本及歐盟的出口下跌，而對美國的出口則增長有限。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求亦拖累區域工業活動及區內貿易。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、韓國及台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體中間需求及最終需求疲弱而下降。香港的服務出口從早年高增長軌道逐漸放緩，最終導致2015年下降0.6%，主要由於入境旅遊放緩。貨品進口亦隨本地及出口引致的需求減弱而回落。相比之下，服務進口增長則因本地居民強勁的旅遊需求而加快。整體而言，2015年淨出口有所改善，對GDP增長作出輕微正面貢獻。\n\n圖表2 本地需求 資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2015年，在國內成本壓力緩和及進口物價通脹下降的背景下，核心通脹進一步回落。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，核心通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（見圖4）。在經濟活動較為低迷的情況下，勞工成本壓力保持穩定，而商業及工業租賃成本壓力則有所緩和，尤其在下半年更為明顯。由於全球大宗商品價格回落及港元強勢，進口物價壓力減緩，同時食品通脹亦保持低水平。鑒於早前季度新落成樓宇租賃的傳導效應較為溫和，通脹中的租金成分壓力得以控制。\n\n圖表3 貨品及服務的出口 來源：人口普查及統計處。\n\n圖4 核心消費者物價膨脹 來源：統計處\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年勞動市場條件保持穩定。勞動需求持續穩定，貿易和旅遊相關部門就業人數的下降，基本上被其他商業部門穩定的招聘速度所抵消，進而使總就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。由於勞動供給也增加1.3%，使季節性調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%（圖表5）。由於勞動市場依然緊張，今年前三個季度名義工資上漲4.7%，較2014年同期的4.3%有所提高。通脹壓力緩解後，今年前三個季度實際工資上漲1.3%，而2014年同期則下降0.1%。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n由於外部環境發生劇烈變化，香港股市經歷了一個波動的一年。在第一季度持平後，本地股市在第二季度因內地A股市場樂觀情緒及資金流入而走高。恆生指數在4月創下七年來新高，滬港通南向每日額度自2014年11月推出以來首次在當月用盡（圖6）。然而，自6月下旬起，本地股市趨勢轉為下跌，恆生指數在9月因內地A股市場及全球股市拋售、全球外匯市場波動加劇以及國際大宗商品價格走弱，下跌28%至年內低點。隨著全球及內地金融市場穩定，香港股市在第四季度有所回升。整體而言，2015年恆生指數錄得7.2%的跌幅，為自2011年以來最差表現，而日均成交額則由2014年的695億港元增至1056億港元。儘管下半年集資活動有所減緩，但本地股市整體集資額仍由一年前的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地产市場\n\n住宅房地產市場出現盤整跡象。在2015年初經歷一段活躍期後，住宅房地產市場於二月第七輪審慎措施公布後走勢趨緩。儘管房價在第四季下跌前上漲速度放緩，但2015年全年房價累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期減少12.3%，降至55,982單位，因二線市場交易活動在下半年明顯下滑。投機性交易，包括確認交易及短線炒房交易，持續保持在低水平。儘管如此，家庭購屋負擔仍持續沉重，價收入比達15.7，收入負擔比遠高於長期平均水準。商用及工業地產市場上半年表現活躍，但交易活動隨後趨緩，價格與租金在第四季均出現下跌。租金報酬率大致與去年同期持平，並維持在歷史低點附近。\n\n圖表6 資產價格 資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有有限公司。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n#經濟環境\n\n預計2016年香港經濟增長將保持疲軟。私人機構分析師預計經濟平均增幅將放緩至1.7%，而政府則預測增長幅度將介乎1%至2%之間。具體而言，全球經濟增長前景疲弱、入境旅遊持續低迷，以及全球金融市場動盪不安所引發的負面溢出效應，將繼續拖累香港出口表現。在本地方面，私人消費預計將保持溫和增長，因經濟動能較弱，勞動市場情況可能面臨一定壓力，而本地資產價格調整或將削弱消費者信心，並引發負面財富效應。建築及工程活動可能保持穩定，但企業信心偏弱及利率上調將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2016年通脹壓力將維持在可控範圍內。進口價格壓力料將保持溫和，而國內成本壓力在中等經濟增長動能下預計亦屬相對溫和。由於2015年底新簽租約房屋租金的壓力逐漸減緩，租金因素對通脹的影響也可能趨緩。市場共識預計2016年整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府則預計核心通脹率為2.0%。受入境旅遊減緩及出口部門持續低迷影響，勞動市場也可能有所放緩。民間機構分析師目前預計2016年失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2016年的經濟前景面臨多項不確定性與風險。特別是美國利率進一步上調的節奏、全球增長前景以及大宗商品價格波動，將持續成為主要不確定因素。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場波動及國際資本流動，進而壓縮本國貨幣與金融條件，對香港的增長前景造成陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將取決於它們通過財富效應與資產負債表效應對樓市的衝擊。儘管樓市正面臨來自全球及本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及樓市供應與需求差距收窄等不利因素所帶來的下行風險，但目前仍需更多時間來判斷樓市是否已進入下行週期。雖然樓市突然調整可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但近年來實施的逆週期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已大幅增強香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體的風險積累，香港銀行業在本年度仍表現出韌性。持牌機構（AIs）的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的持牌機構資本充足。零售銀行的資產質素略微惡化，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n#利率趨勢\n\n與美元利率一致，港元銀行間利率全年處於低位。零售銀行的港元融資成本在上半年隨綜合利率走勢下行，下半年則保持穩定（見圖7）。\n\n圖表7 港元銀行同業拆息率、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）  \n註：  \n1.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管2015年金融市場環境動盪不安，且美國於12月加息，香港美元匯率整體仍大致穩定。貨幣市場亦持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。作為香港過去數十年來貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度持續對外來衝擊具備高度韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為香港貨幣在國際外滙市場對美元的匯率維持在港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元的波動範圍內。貨幣體系的結構特徵為貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備資產支持，且貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須由美元儲備資產的相應變動來完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包含\n\n* 債務證書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全面支持  \n* 政府發行並流通行中的紙幣和硬幣  \n* 總結餘，即銀行在港元銀行（HKMA）存放的清算賬戶餘額總和  \n* 香港金融管理局（HKMA）代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund 票據和債券\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可兌換承諾（CUs）來維持。當港幣需求高於供應，市場匯率強升至強方兌換承諾（CUs）的港幣7.75兌1美元時，香港金融管理局隨時準備向銀行出售港幣以換取美元。總體餘額隨即擴張，壓低港幣利率，創造貨幣條件，使港幣從強方限制移動至兌換區間7.75至7.85之內。反之，若港幣供應高於需求，市場匯率弱降至弱方兌換承諾（CUs）的港幣7.85兌1美元時，香港金融管理局將向銀行購入港幣。總體餘額隨即收縮，推高港幣利率，使港幣從弱方限制移動至兌換區間內。\n\n在此所示的債務證書及流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣均以港幣面值列示。本年度報告中匯兌基金資產負債表所列的對應項目，則以等值於其贖回所需美元金額的港幣表示，該金額根據資產負債表日的現行匯率計算。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\n這裡顯示的EFBN金額與本年度報告中外匯基金的資產負債表所載金額不同。根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表外匯基金持有用於二級市場交易的EFBN，會與發行的EFBN相抵銷，淨額會計入資產負債表。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2015年港元兌美元匯率大致穩定，在7.7500至7.7657之間窄幅波動（圖1）。2015年初，市場對美國加息的擔憂令港元承受輕微貶值壓力。然而，第二季港元匯率回升至接近7.75水平，主要由於股市活動活躍，促使與股權相關的港元需求急升，導致4月強方觸發機制屢次被觸發。進入年中後，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著拋售，以及全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動性增加，港元兌美元匯率在8月仍維持於接近7.75水平。9月及10月，由於離岸人民幣兌港元的轉換增加，強方觸發機制再度被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25個基點，港元兌美元匯率仍維持於狹窄範圍內波動，未出現顯著資金外流壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場環境動盪，2015年港元匯率市場仍有序運作。\n\n圖表1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於強方貨幣單位（CU）在四月、九月及十月屢次被觸發，香港金融管理局根據貨幣局原則，被動地從銀行購入總額293億美元，換取2,272億港元。這導致總結餘相應擴張，其中部分擴張被銀行對流動性管理的強烈需求所引發的額外發行外匯基金債券所抵消（見圖表2）。外匯基金紙幣的額外發行符合貨幣局原則，因為這代表貨幣基礎組成的改變，而貨幣基礎則完全由外匯儲備支持。總結餘與未償還外匯基金債券及紙幣的總額，由2014年底的9925億港元增至2015年底的12,210億港元。\n\n圖表2 2015年總餘額及未償還外匯基金債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在銀行體系流動性充足的情況下，2015年全年香港銀行間利率持續處於低位。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）由0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%後，根據預設公式，香港銀行利率亦於12月17日由0.5%上調至0.75%。整體而言，2015年香港銀行間利率從隔夜至三個月期的各期限均低於基準利率（見圖3），波幅相對溫和，主要受銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場波動加劇導致流動性收緊所影響。大致跟隨香港銀行間拆息率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行間拆息率（LIBOR）的利差，香港元遠期點數於8月因市場流動性收緊而轉為顯著升水，但隨後因美元利率普遍上調而於年底轉為貼水（見圖4）。總體而言，貨幣市場運作正常，貼現窗融資並不活躍，2015年總額僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖表3 2015年港幣銀行間利率\n\n圖表4：2015年港幣遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定性作出重大貢獻。鑒於香港小型開放經濟體的特質及其作為國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最合適的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定不移地致力維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定性進一步增強了政府承諾的可信度，公眾持續對港元作為支付手段和儲值工具抱有強烈信心。在2015年與香港進行的第四條協議磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續認可聯繫匯率制度為香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港健全的制度、法律和政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑒於穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管力度，以提升銀行業的韌性。鑒於美國利率上調，HKMA提醒公眾應做好風險管理的必要準備，指出任何觸發弱方貨幣單位及港元外流，都是香港美元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高貨幣基金會賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產用以支持貨幣基礎。2015年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）波動範圍較窄，介乎106.3%至107.5%之間，未觸及上、下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收於106.3%（見圖表5）。根據LERS機制，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財務資源為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供了強大後盾，以應對突如其來的衝擊。\n\n圖表5 2015年擔保比率的每日波動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港儲備基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣基金會小組委員會負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，該小組委員會審議的議題包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款、宏觀審慎措施的國際應用、美國加息對香港樓市的影響、基準利率的計算公式、香港美元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。小組委員會的討論紀錄及提交給該委員會的貨幣基金會運作報告，已上載至香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港貨幣研究所（HKIMR）繼續在貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域資助研究。2015年，該機構資助了16位研究員，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會。其中主要的包括：\n\n* 2023年1月舉行的第六屆中國經濟國際研討會，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定性：中國與國際經驗」。會議發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，內容涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸繁榮與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定性，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等廣泛議題。\n* 2023年5月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、制度與經濟增長研討會」。會議探討多項經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場等。\n* 2023年10月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦準備理事會理事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦準備銀行合辦「貨幣政策分歧、全球資本流動與金融穩定」研討會。會議深入探討多項議題，包括貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率之間的關係、貨幣政策分歧對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該機構於八月舉辦了第13屆HKIMR暑期研討會，並於九月舉辦了第13屆HKIMR內地經濟研討會，探討中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。研討會及研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的參與者。此外，該機構當年共舉辦了24場公開研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融等多方面議題。\n\n# 紙幣和硬幣\n\n2015年底，流通中的紙幣總值為港幣3602億元，較去年同期增加5.3%（圖表6、7和8）。政府發行的紙幣和硬幣總值為港幣112億元，較去年同期上升2.9%（圖表9和10）。政府發行的10元紙幣流通總值為港幣40億元，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將其監管重點放在持牌機構的風險治理上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理體系、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售實務。隨著系統性風險的累積，香港金融管理局於2016年1月1日宣布對香港實施0.625%的管轄區逆週期資本緩衝（並於2017年1月1日提高至1.25%）。五家持牌機構被指定為本地系統重要銀行，將需遵守較高損失吸收能力資本緩衝。隨著《金融機構（解決）條例草案》提交立法會，復甦與解決機制改革取得重大進展。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融從業人員的技能與知識發展。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要發達經濟體之間貨幣政策立場出現分歧的跡象中，新興市場在2015年面臨資本外流風險增加及經濟增長放緩的更高風險。為維持銀行體系在可能突然惡化的宏觀經濟環境中的韌性，香港金融管理局持續密切監測授權機構（AIs）風險治理的有效性及其信貸及流動性風險管理系統。\n\n# 運作監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局繼續採用監管方法，即在進行常規現場檢查的同時，增加主題性審查的次數。主題性審查是針對選定持牌機構群組的特定風險領域或特定活動而進行的深入非現場審查。這種方法使香港金融管理局得以優先配置監管資源，專注於持牌機構所面臨的新興及更重大的風險。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）共進行了193次現場檢查。鑒於銀行機構貸款組合資產質素出現惡化跡象，HKMA加強了針對信貸風險管理及資產質素的主題性深入現場檢查。同時，鑒於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策出現分歧，市場不確定性增加，HKMA亦提高了對與財務相關活動的檢查次數。此外，HKMA亦對與內地業務相關的檢查、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制機制，以及銀行機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型進行了現場檢查。本年度內，專門團隊亦對銀行機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查相似的範疇。表1列載運作監督工作的詳情。\n\n2015年，針對AI的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運營進行了196次非現場審查。監管重點放在風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸以及巴塞爾協議III標準的落實監督。監管團隊與所選AI的董事會及外部審計師保持頻繁聯繫。與AI的高階管理階層及外部審計師舉行了20場三方會議，同時與所選AI的全體董事會或董事會級委員會舉行了23場會議。\n\n銀行監督審查委員會審理了四個案例，所有案例均涉及人工智能的授權。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以處理相互競爭的優先事項，香港金管局持續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求持牌機構聘請外部審計師跟進可能具有重大影響的監管問題。香港金管局於2015年根據此條款委聘了六份報告，其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢\/反恐融资（AML\/CFT）控制措施，另外兩份報告則涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則涉及證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，沒有任何持牌機構違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動比率的規定。條例各項條文合共出現84宗違規情況，但均未影響存款人的利益，且已由持牌機構及時糾正。\n\n表1 運作監督\n\n# 銀行條例第52條的權限\n\n滙理銀行有限公司繼續受《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力管轄。香港金融管理局於2008年6月25日根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對滙理銀行香港分行的事務、業務及財產所作出的指示，在本年度內持續有效。香港金融管理局將繼續與有關當局保持定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總行相關的發展，並會密切留意所採取的監管措施，以保障AI存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評級審查\n\nCAMEL核准委員會審查並確定金融機構的綜合CAMEL評分。金融機構已被告知評分結果，並給予要求複審的機會。當年度無任何複審要求。\n\n#專門監督工作\n\n# 對營運及科技風險的監督\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續就操作及科技風險管理事宜發佈新指引或更新指引，以應對新興風險及行業發展。特別是，香港金融管理局已完成有關電子銀行（e-banking）的監管政策手冊（SPM）模塊的修訂，允許授權機構在提供新電子銀行服務方面擁有更大靈活性。此外，香港金融管理局亦發佈有關網絡安全的通函，強調授權機構董事會及高層管理人員需對有效的網絡安全風險管理進行監督。香港金融管理局亦定期發行其「操作事故觀察」，重點介紹所選詐騙案件或操作事故的手法，以及所識別的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局進行以風險為本的主題性現場及非現場監管審查，以評估獲授權機構（AIs）在企業層面或特定業務範疇內的營運及科技風險管理情況。這些審查涵蓋與AIs營運風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防止異常交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢的科技控制等特定範疇。這些監管審查亦配合年度獨立合規檢查，涵蓋營運風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性規劃，其中選定的AIs須聘請獨立且具資格的評估人員，檢視其相關控制措施的充分性，並修復所發現的弱點。香港金融管理局亦識別並分析AIs營運及科技風險的趨勢及監管重點，特別針對在維持香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的持牌機構。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）監督銀行業在2015年底完成晶片式自動櫃員機技術的最終階段實施，透過此技術，持牌機構已完成純信用咭的換卡程序。香港金融管理局亦要求發卡持牌機構實施驗證控制措施，以進一步提升「無實體卡片」信用咭交易的安全性。另外，香港金融管理局在接獲報告指部分非接觸式信用咭所儲存的持卡人姓名可能被隱蔽地存取後，要求有關持牌機構迅速採取行動，通知及保護受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局亦投入資源，公佈並解釋事件的規模及影響，以緩解公眾關注，並監督持牌機構的糾正措施，包括迅速更換受影響的咭件。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦有關電子銀行安全預防措施的公眾教育計劃、建立分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為香港金融服務業務連續性管理論壇舉辦的應急管理演習提供支援及建議，該演習參與機構包括銀行及其他金融機構。\n\n# 理財及強制性公積金相關業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構密切合作，就持牌機構銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引及進行監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構理事會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期溝通。這些會議涵蓋不同金融服務業界內有密切業務關係的金融集團或受規管實體所涉及的各項問題，以確保更協調及有效的監管行動。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）對持牌機構（AIs）進行了25項現場及非現場主題檢查，以及15項非現場監察。這些檢查涵蓋投資產品的銷售、處理證券交易結算及客戶證券的安全保管，以及涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品及強制性公積金（MPF）相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月，香港金融管理局向授權機構發出通函，就向客戶銷售NLTI產品時的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助授權機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與財政司司長辦公室（財政及庫務局）在《保險公司（修訂）條例2014》的立法過程中密切合作，以建立一個獨立的保險業監管局，並為保險中介人設立法定牌照制度。2015年7月，立法會通過《保險公司（修訂）條例2015》，其中規定透過授權，賦予貨幣管理局對保險中介人活動進行檢查和調查的權力。\n\n香港金融管理局處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RIs）的申請，以及一宗註冊機構從事額外受規管活動的申請。管理局批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券活動的高級人員，並對由註冊機構提交、用以納入香港金融管理局維護登記冊的9,697名人士進行了背景調查。\n\n# 國庫活動監督\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續將持牌機構（AIs）的流動性風險管理列為其監管重點之一，特別是在美國利率正常化預期及隨後可能出現的資金流動逆轉，對AIs流動性狀況可能產生影響的情況下。在2015年全年，HKMA繼續實施針對AIs的強化穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金來支持貸款業務。自2015年1月1日開始實施巴塞爾協議III的流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）以來，HKMA一直監測第一類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構一般維持LCR接近或超過100%，遠高於根據過渡安排於2015年所設定的法定最低要求60%。\n\n另外，金管局就選定持牌機構管理預期利率正常化相關風險的控制架構，進行主題性現場檢查。在市場波動期間，金管局亦密切關注突發市場變動對銀行業及個別持牌機構的影響，並採取適切後續措施。\n\n# 監管機構主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行自下而上的監管機構主導壓力測試計劃，以更深入了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及惡化經濟環境下的韌性，並鼓勵銀行制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的方案。本年度內引入多項改進措施，以收集更細緻的資料，從而更深入掌握所選領域的風險動態。香港金融管理局分析了參與機構提交的測試結果，並與其討論如何進一步改善壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產質量\n\n#信貸增長與資產品質\n\n以往幾年強勁的信貸增長趨勢自2015年下半年起已減緩。整體而言，銀行部門的總貸款額增加3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降（表2）。由於客戶存款增速快於銀行貸款，2015年底整體貸款佔存款比率降至70.1%，較一年前的72.2%有所下降。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟和金融環境充滿挑戰，呼籲加強國際合作與溝通以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括強化金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港紮實的經濟基本面和穩健的財政表現持續獲得信貸評級機構認可，標準普爾繼續維持對香港的最高評級AAA評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，就對全球及區域金融穩定具有重要意義的議題發表意見。今年七月，香港金融管理局接任亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）共同主席職務，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定理事會成員與非成員之間在政策倡議上的交流，鼓勵落實金融改革，並促進有關金融穩定議題的觀點交流。香港金融管理局持續與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局密切合作，強化東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）——該機構已升格為國際組織——的運作，以監測與分析區域經濟形勢，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n今年，因多個市場因素影響，香港的離岸人民幣池及債券發行規模出現一定程度的收縮。然而，市場繼續有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易額均保持穩定增長。此外，香港作為人民幣業務的中心，促成了國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）將人民幣認定為自由使用的貨幣。IMF決定將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將進一步推動人民幣國際化，同時促進香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢方面發揮重要作用。香港人民幣支付系統的交易額於2015年創下新高，而場外（OTC）衍生工具交易倉儲則持續支持實體按照於七月推出的場外衍生工具市場監管制度的要求，報告其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年進一步加強香港的金融基礎設施，新增多項組成部分及服務，包括於同年12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著現時已有超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及流動通訊渠道接收及處理客戶的電子支票。電子帳單呈遞及支付（EBPP）服務自2013年推出以來，於2015年持續見到商戶參與度增加。同年7月，中央銀錢市場單位（CMu）在其基金訂單路由服務下推出新服務，以支持內地與香港基金互認安排（MRF）的實施。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦隨《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）於11月生效而得到改善。根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》，香港金融管理局獲賦權推行多用途儲值設施的強制許可制度，並執行相關監管及執法職能，同時指定重要零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際及區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫日益緊密，香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極透過國際及區域論壇，包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），推動與其他管轄區的合作，促進可持續經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以協助強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）RCG(A)的共同主席，並於十月在香港主辦其第九次會議。RCG(A)作為FSB成員與非FSB成員溝通與合作處理金融穩定問題的重要平台，吸引了來自16個亞洲司法管轄區財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高級代表與會，討論地區面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、操守風險及存款保險制度的經驗。HKMA亦於八月共同主持了一場有關香港宏觀審慎政策的研討會，該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）組織，並吸引了來自全球18個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了各自在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點探討工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。HKMA亦與英國央行及國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）共同舉辦了會議，探討央行及其他政策制定者在選擇貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策最佳組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了超過一百名參與者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 促進亞洲貨幣與金融穩定\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續致力於推動亞洲地區的金融穩定，並發揮地區集體聲音在國際金融事務中的作用。作為東亞及太平洋中央銀行理事會（EMEAP）下設貨幣與金融穩定委員會的宏觀監測工作協調機構，香港金融管理局持續準備該委員會的半年度《宏觀監測報告》，以評估地區風險與脆弱性及其政策含義。作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組的主席，香港金融管理局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準與最佳實務，以及國內與跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗交流與資訊共享。同時，香港金融管理局亦領導該工作小組的跨境合作與發展子小組。香港金融管理局於六月在香港主辦了EMEAP\/BIS外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）的會議。會議由來自地區及主要經濟體的17個機構代表參與，審視了金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革進展。\n\n在去年香港與東盟加三成員國簽署AMRO協議後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在增強版CMIM下的關鍵作用。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局持續與國際信用評級機構保持密切對話，以呈現香港經濟表現和財政實力的平衡評估。這些努力促成2015年所有主要信用評級機構對香港信用評級的肯定。標準普爾維持對香港最高等級的AAA評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體擁有高於平均水平的增長前景、可觀的財政儲備、始終健康的財政表現以及強勁的淨外資產地位。穆迪投資服務機構和惠譽評級亦分別將香港的評級維持在Aa1和AA+，僅次於三A級一個級別。\n\n# 香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港的人民幣資金池產生影響。截至年底，人民幣客戶存款及存單餘額為1,010億元，較去年同期的1,158億元有所下降（圖1）。在境內市場利率下行背景下，離岸人民幣債券發行放緩，導致香港人民幣債券發行規模降至75億元。另一方面，香港銀行辦理的人民幣貿易結算交易額增長9%，達6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款未償餘額亦年增58%，達297億元（圖2）。人民幣實時全額清算（RTGS）系統的日均交易額增至947億元，較2014年增長29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步擴展，根據調查結果顯示，2015年4月底日均交易額約為930億美元，較2013年4月上次BIS三年期調查時增長88%。香港仍為最大離岸人民幣業務樞紐，市場深度與廣度俱佳。另一項強化此地位的重要發展是2015年7月推出的MRF計劃，該計劃擴展了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）擴展跨境人民幣資金流動渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界共同推動香港人民幣金融平台建設的努力，繼續結出成果。6月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，允許離岸人民幣業務清算銀行及參與銀行在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得資金匯往境外，以便利銀行在離岸市場進行人民幣流動性管理。9月，中國人民銀行放寬跨境人民幣現金池規則，使更多跨國企業可在簡化安排下進行集團內部現金轉移。7月，內地當局亦擴大了外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金對境內銀行間債券市場的准入。9月，內地進一步向這些機構開放外匯市場。\n\n2015年11月30日，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）宣布決定，自2016年10月1日起將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子。此決定肯定了人民幣作為自由使用的貨幣地位，進一步增強了國際社會使用人民幣進行全球交易的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化以及中國內地與全球經濟金融體系聯繫的加強中，獲得新的業務機會。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同舉辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣業務論壇，並第二次與馬來西亞及泰國合作推動民間部門就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些措施，香港銀行加強了與其他市場的人民幣業務流動及聯繫，將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強市場推廣，透過參與在香港及海外市場包括加拿大、日本和非洲等地的行業活動，促進企業及機構在貿易、投資及融資中更廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁葉國華於2015年12月11日出席香港倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間，在研討會上發言。\n\n# 中港更緊密經貿關係安排\n\n內地與香港於11月在《更緊密經貿關係安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年廣東省推出的大部分試點自由化措施擴展至全國範圍。新協議原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，預計將為這些銀行在內地經營業務提供更大的政策確定性和靈活性。\n\n# 培訓\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續為來自中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀監會的官員提供培訓課程。除涉及中央銀行事務及一般風險管理的課程外，內容還包括消費者保護、信用參考、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健性指標分析以及系統性風險監測等主題。此外，亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表團舉辦了臨時培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局 (HKMA) 為機構政府債券安排了八次招標，總金額為204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 準備金管理\n\n2015年是全球金融市場動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此艱難且困難的投資環境中，儲備基金在2015年錄得整體投資回報率為-0.6%，但與主要市場指數及可比投資基金相比，其虧損相對較輕，歸功於香港金融管理局近年來部署的一系列防禦性措施，增強了儲備基金的韌性。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《香港儲備基金條例》，儲備基金的主要目的是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性及完整性，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。儲備基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢儲備基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於財政司司長認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交易所基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\nEFAC 已為 Exchange Fund 設定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保本；  \n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均完全由高流動性的美元計值資產支持；  \n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣與金融穩定；及  \n(d) 在(a)至(c)的前提下，實現有助於維持基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了 Exchange Fund 的法定宗旨，並納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n\n廣義而言，儲備基金擁有兩個主要組合——擔保組合及投資組合。擔保組合持有高流動性的美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分擔保。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。兩個組合整體的債券與股票長期目標配置比例為72:28。就目標貨幣配置而言，資產的81%配置於美元和港幣，其餘19%配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正以謹慎和漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外物業投資。新興市場及內地債券和股票屬於投資組合，而私募股權及房地產投資則屬於長期增長組合（LTGP）。長期增長組合下HKMA投資的淨資產價值上限維持在外匯基金累積結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，長期增長組合下的投資市值總計為1421億港元，其中私募股權為913億港元，房地產為508億港元，未償還的投資承諾金額為1224億港元。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年成立，用以持有香港交易及結算所有限公司之股份，該股份由政府為香港儲備基金帳戶以戰略目的購入。由於該投資組合具有特殊性質，因此未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 準備金管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券投資基金的投資過程基於兩種資產配置決策——戰略資產配置與戰術資產配置。戰略資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表根據證券投資基金的投資目標所確定的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術配置，以期獲得超越基準的超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與基準（即戰略）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異被稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準及戰術偏離的範圍由財政司長與證券投資基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）磋商後確定，但戰術決策則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據授權作出。在戰術偏離允許的範圍內，組合經理可以建立頭寸以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，其中包括全部背書組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列組合，以及為基金實施宏觀風險管理策略而設的各種衍生工具疊加組合。\n\n# 外部經理的運用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局還聘請位於多個國際金融中心的外部資產管理公司，管理約24%的外匯基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他特殊資產。聘請外部管理公司的目的是挖掘市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現多樣化的投資風格組合，並將市場知識與資訊傳遞給內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理費、托管費、交易成本以及預扣稅及其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，且每年可能有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。針對內部及外聘管理的投資組合，均已建立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監督其合規情況。風險控制工具被用於在正常及不利市場環境下評估市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內外資產管理人的投資專業能力。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n#2015年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場高度波動，其中股市尤為劇烈。上半年主要股市創下新高，然而第三季因中國經濟增長擔憂，市場情緒急劇惡化，主要股市逆轉累計漲幅，錄得顯著季度虧損。其後隨市場情緒改善，全球股市有所復甦，但年底再度惡化。由於與中國內地經濟密切聯動，2015年香港股市表現劣於其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國利率將正常化且美國利率上行週期開始，2015年美國長期國債收益率仍小幅上漲，樂觀情緒受到全球經濟增長擔憂、持續的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇的制約。另一方面，在歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策推動下，歐洲短期政府債券收益率下跌，甚至有部分跌入負利率區間。\n\n在貨幣市場上，2015年美元持續走強，美元指數在預期美國政策利率正常化啟動的背景下急升近10%。歐元在第一季度大幅走弱，創下自1999年歐元誕生以來最大單季跌幅，當時歐洲央行於1月宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日元在2015年對美元大致持平。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 準備金管理\n\n# 香港儲備基金的表現\n\n在金融市場異常波動及投資環境艱難的背景下，儲備基金於2015年錄得158億港元的投資虧損，其中包括海外股票帶來的71億港元收益、香港股票造成的50億港元虧損、債券帶來的159億港元收益、非港元資產因貨幣翻譯效果產生的449億港元負面影響，以及基金投資控股子公司所持其他投資帶來的111億港元收益。由於去年美元大幅升值，在將儲備基金的非美元資產轉換為港元時，此負面貨幣翻譯效果無法避免。另外，戰略組合錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n外匯基金於2015年底的總資產達到3,4229億港元。扣除戰略組合後，外匯基金2015年的投資回報率為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及整體投資基金界相比，外匯基金的虧損可謂相對輕微。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局近年已推出一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的久期、提高現金持有比例，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化進程，特別是透過LTGP進行的投資。這些措施增強了外匯基金的韌性，並有助緩衝部分潛在損失。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年回報率詳見圖表1。表2顯示了2015年的投資回報率，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報率。過去三年的平均回報率為1.2%，過去五年的平均回報率為1.8%，過去十年的平均回報率為3.3%，自1994年以來的平均回報率為5.0%。表3顯示了2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n圖表1 儲備基金投資回報（1994 – 2015）  \n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略組合的持倉。  \n2. 綜合消費者物價指數是基於以2009\/2010為基準的系列計算的。\n"}

Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及各種其他渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策和運作的了解。2015年，香港金融管理局透過支持員工專業發展、推行嚴謹的財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安，以及重新分配高層管理人員的職責，以改善公司治理，並應對因新計劃和系統的實施以及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 參與社區 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體密切合作，提高透明度，並促進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。2015年共舉辦59項公開媒體活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14次站立式訪問及31項其他公眾活動。另外安排了43次媒體訪問，發佈325份雙語新聞公報，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為提高公眾對香港金融管理局關鍵職能的認識，分別舉辦了兩次媒體參觀活動，前往香港紙幣印刷有限公司及香港銀行間清算有限公司（HKICL），以展示香港世界級的紙幣印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時舉辦了有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及儲備基金的教育研討會，為媒體提供更深入的簡報，以加深其對這些重要主題的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖（中間）及常務董事（貨幣管理）李惠來（右）在香港印鈔有限公司的媒體參觀活動期間檢查紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n在媒體參觀HKICL期間進行自動化支票分類示範。照片中間（由左至右）為香港按揭證券有限公司首席執行官陳諾言先生、金融基礎設施執行總監李志強先生，以及HKICL首席執行官黃嘉怡女士。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供了一個有效途徑，以從香港金融管理局（HKMA）獲取資訊，使他們能更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務於2015年處理了9,078宗查詢，約一半涉及銀行政策與法規、紙幣與硬幣，以及消費者銀行業務等事項。值得注意的例子包括樓宇按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收集計劃等。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年以來接獲的公眾查詢數量，圖表2則提供2015年按查詢性質分類的細分資料。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除香港金融管理局（HKMA）年度報告外，香港金融管理局亦發佈了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告、四期季度通訊，並定期更新月度統計通訊，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發佈了14篇inSight文章，涵蓋各項具時效性及重要性的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局2014年度報告在香港管理專業協會2015年度最佳年報獎的「非牟利機構及慈善組織」類別中獲得銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的公司網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）擁有超過50,000頁的英文及繁體和簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取HKMA最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的授權機構（AIs）證券人員登記冊，以及AIs及本地代表辦事處登記冊。隨著《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的實施，網站亦會載有根據該條例維護的儲值支付工具牌照持有人登記冊。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以引起公眾對重要及及時資訊的關注，例如提醒公眾提高警惕，防止詐騙電話，以及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣推車的位置等資訊。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n#公共教育計劃\n\n香港金融管理局位於國際金融中心二期55樓的資訊中心，是向社區介紹香港金融管理局工作，並提高公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心由展覽區及圖書館組成，每周六天向公眾開放。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，包括有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n資訊中心為遊客安排導覽團。該中心在一年內接待了超過48,300人次的遊客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導覽（圖3）。自2003年12月啟用以來，已有超過530,400人次造訪資訊中心。\n\n位於展覽區旁邊的圖書館收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，用於深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及財政事務以及中央銀行相關主題。圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，維護香港授權機構的電子登記冊。\n\n在香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續推動社區接觸的計劃中，該機構繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，共舉辦了三場講座，約有2,300名中學生及教師參與。講座主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，參與人數已超過54,700人。\n\n圖表3 資訊中心團體參觀類型\n\n在資訊中心的導覽期間，年輕訪客了解貨幣與銀行業的發展。\n\n中學生和老師參加公眾教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）招募、培養並維持一支高度專業的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的重點工作。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但它能夠以與公務員不同的條件聘僱員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局力求維持精簡靈活的架構，並重新配置員工資源以推動新計劃及應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年12月在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立零售支付監理處，以履行香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》所新增的法定職能，包括對儲值設施及其他零售支付系統的發牌及日常監管。為加強部門之間的協同效應，並重新分配人力資源優先次序，以應對新措施推行帶來的挑戰，以及工作量增加和工作複雜性提高的問題，於2015年擬訂了多個部門職責的重組安排，並於2016年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基建部（FID）從執法部（ENFD）及澳門金融管理局（MMD）的貨幣科接管了存款保障計劃的管理及清算功能。同時，該部門亦從銀行部門接管了與銀行相關的工作，例如消費者教育、董事發展及加強銀行從業人員的勝任力框架；\n\n外部部門接替了MMD的市場發展職能，而後者將繼續其與財政市場協會及金融基準相關的工作；\n\nENFD 接替銀行監管部，接管反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險處，並更名為執法與反洗錢處。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 人事\n\n2015年香港金融管理局（HKMA）的編制為841人，2016年增加34人至875人（增幅為4%），以確保有足夠資源應對（i）新法例及措施的實施，（ii）已證實有必要持續進行的試點項目，以及（ii）現有工作的複雜性及工作量不斷增加。新增職位將分配至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n\n強化銀行監管工作，包括銀行壓力測試流程的現場檢查、國際銀行標準的落實以及同業評審；\n\n強化對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監督；\n\n落實依據新實施之場外衍生性商品申報及保存紀錄規定，針對透過銀行及核准經紀機構辦理之場外衍生性商品所建立之監理架構；\n\n強化反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法力度。\n\n積極推進金融機構（處置）條例的規劃及準備工作，該條例採用國際標準以應對金融業的『太大而不能倒』問題；\n\n透過制定針對銀行獨立非執行董事的董事賦能計劃，以提升銀行治理水平，並與業界合作，推動銀行從業人員在銀行核心業務領域的專業能力框架建設，進一步加強銀行業的能力建設。\n\n增強在新型銀行、證券及保險產品方面的行為政策與研究能力。\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育努力；以及\n\n加強對境內人民幣市場及CNH市場的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作為目標。\n\n強化投資、風險管理及法律支持，以應對與設立未來基金相關的擴展投資活動，以及交易所基金投資產品的進一步多元化，並提升戰略性資產配置和投資流程，以應對日益嚴峻的投資環境。\n\n實施新的法定制度，賦權香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監管儲值設施及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業職能\n\n臨時資源用於應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局（HKMA）會將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或香港金融管理局有興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分員工以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障委員會及財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 報酬政策與薪資審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）在匯率基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）下轄的管治小組委員會（GSC）建議下，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）職員的薪酬及服務條件，並參考現行市價水平和常規做法。薪酬包括總現金包及供款計劃，附帶的實物福利極少。現金包由月薪（或基本工資）及變動薪酬組成，後者視表現而定，每年以現金獎勵形式發放一次。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬由財政司司長（FS）每年審閱，審閱時會根據特別財政委員會（EFAC）向政府總部（GSC）提出的建議，並考慮GSC對HKMA上一年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問機構進行的金融界薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。為保持薪酬競爭力，亦可不時對個別表現卓越的員工作出特殊薪酬調整。\n\n任何經批准的固定薪酬年度調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工的表現分配給個別員工。香港金融管理局（HKMA）的投資專業人員受變動薪酬制度約束，該制度旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。總經理或以上級別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，須由財務服務（FS）在總監理委員會（GSC）的建議下批准，有關員工在討論其薪酬時不會出席會議。部門主管或以下級別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金融管理局首席執行官根據財務服務（FS）授予的權力，在經批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n審計主任報告 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計主任報告\n\n# 审计署  \n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n#獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n我聲明，我已審計香港交易所基金及其附屬公司（「該集團」）於第134至222頁所列之財務報表，該財務報表包括香港交易所基金及該集團截至2015年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該年度截至之日之收支賬戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表、現金流量表，以及重要會計政策摘要及其他說明資料。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣當局須根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》(第66章)第7條頒發的指示及香港財務報告準則，編製反映真實及公允觀點的財務報表，並制定貨幣當局認為必要以確保財務報表免受重大錯報影響的內部控制措施，無論該等錯報是因舞弊或錯誤所致。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計工作，對這些財務報表發表意見。我進行審計工作時，遵守行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條所發出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準。這些標準要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃及執行審計工作，以取得合理保證，確保財務報表沒有重大錯報。\n\n审计包括执行程序以获取有关财务报表金额和披露事项的审计证据。所选择的程序取决于审计师的判断，包括对财务报表存在重大错报风险的评估，无论该风险是由于舞弊还是错误所致。在进行这些风险评估时，审计师会考虑与被审计单位编制公允反映财务报表相关的内部控制，以设计适合具体情况的审计程序，但并非为了对被审计单位内部控制的有效性发表意见。审计还包括评估货币当局所采用的会计政策的适当性及所作出的会计估计的合理性，以及评估财务报表的整体列报。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且恰當，足以作為我提出審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計主任報告（續）\n\n# 意見\n\n根據我的意見，截至2015年12月31日，證券基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，均在符合香港財務報告準則的基礎上，真實和公允地反映於財務報表中，且財務報表已根據行政長官根據《證券基金條例》第7條所發出的指示妥善編製。\n\n大衛·孫 审计部主管\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會  \n第26層  \n移民局大樓  \n格洛斯特道7號  \n香港灣仔\n\n# 目錄\n\n收支帳戶  \n綜合收益表  \n資產負債表  \n股東權益變動表  \n現金流量表  \n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務活動  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變更  \n4. 收入及支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產及負債類別  \n7. 現金及隨時可提取的現金  \n8. 存放於銀行及其他金融機構  \n9. 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產  \n10. 可供出售證券  \n11. 衍生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期日證券  \n13. 貸款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 子公司權益  \n17. 聯營公司及合營企業權益  \n18. 投資性不動產  \n19. 房屋、廠房及設備  \n20. 債券、政府發行之流通紙幣及硬幣  \n21. 銀行體系餘額  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構之存放  \n23. 財政儲備存放  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存放  \n25. 發行外匯基金債券及票據  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 發行其他債務證券  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股東權益  \n30. 現金流量表中現金及現金等價物分析  \n31. 業務分部資訊  \n32. 質押資產  \n33. 承諾  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重大關聯方交易  \n36. 金融風險管理  \n37. 金融工具公允價值計量  \n38. 非調整性財務報表日後事項  \n39. 2015年12月31日止年度尚未生效之修訂、新準則及解釋之可能影響  \n40. 財務報表核准\n\n# 外匯基金 – 收支帳戶\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註構成這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 綜合收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註構成這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 兌換基金 – 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n諾曼·T.
