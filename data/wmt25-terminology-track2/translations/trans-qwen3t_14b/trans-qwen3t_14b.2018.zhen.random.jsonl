{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Over the past ten years, the international political and economic situation has experienced significant changes, with many scenes beyond what the best scriptwriters could imagine. In last year's annual report, I noted that the performance of financial markets in 2017 was \"better than expected,\" while also mentioning that \"underlying concerns\" existed for the outlook. Looking back at 2018, it could be described as \"started well but ended off-colour.\" Shortly after several global stock indices reached record highs in January, the bullish investment sentiment immediately encountered the cold front of US-China trade tensions. Combined with the prolonged stalemate in Brexit negotiations, deteriorating geopolitical tensions, and the Federal Reserve's four interest rate hikes, the market's optimistic sentiment sharply reversed, leading to a significant decline in asset prices during the year. The MSCI Global Index fell 20.3% from peak to trough, ending the year with a cumulative decline of about 10%, making it the worst year since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 26.7% from its peak, declining 13.6% for the year, recording the largest annual decline in seven years.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System is resilient – the foundation of confidence.\n\nDespite the volatile external environment, Hong Kong's financial system has remained resilient, with smooth operations in the currency market. The Linked Exchange Rate System, implemented for 35 years, successfully withstood the challenge of capital outflows from Hong Kong dollars. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately 1,000 billion Hong Kong dollars equivalent in funds have flowed into Hong Kong dollars. Last year, as U.S. interest rates rose, the interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the U.S. continued to widen, leading to an increase in \"sell Hong Kong dollars, buy U.S. dollars\" carry trade activities. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the U.S. dollar weakened at the beginning of the year. The \"Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking,\" established in April 2005, was first triggered and then triggered another 26 times during the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) fulfilled the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking in accordance with the established mechanism, orderly and transparently absorbing 103.5 billion Hong Kong dollars of Hong Kong dollar selling pressure in the market. As capital flowed out, the Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) rose by 105 basis points within a month, and banks also raised their prime rates after the U.S. interest rate hike in September last year. The HKMA has repeatedly and timely explained the operational mechanism of the \"Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking\" to the public through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows from Hong Kong dollars are a necessary part of the normalization of Hong Kong's interest rates and the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Linked Exchange Rate System in Hong Kong at the end of last year, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government also emphasized that the Linked Exchange Rate System is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's currency stability. This has helped maintain public confidence in the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Banking system: with stronger resilience and making progress\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis exposed latent flaws and risks in the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to introduce a series of reforms targeting financial markets and financial institutions, including enhancing corporate governance and risk management in the banking sector. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) banking supervision focuses on two key areas: first, prudent supervision of banks' asset-liability risks; and second, the conduct of banks. Both aspects are equally important. In terms of asset-liability risk supervision, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, the HKMA has the responsibility to fully implement international regulatory standards and ensure that Hong Kong's banking sector operates in a sound and prudent manner. At the end of last year, Hong Kong's banking capital adequacy ratio reached 20.3%, which is not only significantly higher than the international minimum standard of 8%, but also notably higher than the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. The average liquidity coverage ratio of major banks in the fourth quarter of last year reached 167.6%, which is also far above the statutory minimum requirement of 90%. At the same time, to avoid repeating the need to use public funds to rescue \"too big to fail\" financial institutions during the global financial crisis, the Financial Stability Board established international standards for the resolution mechanisms of financial institutions. Hong Kong is one of the few regions in Asia that has fully implemented mechanisms in line with these requirements. The HKMA's Office for Resolution Mechanisms is currently implementing the operational details of this mechanism, requiring banks to carry out structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when necessary. Last year, the HKMA also introduced the \"Loss-absorbing Capacity Rules,\" and will continue to roll out more related rules in the future.\n\nIn view of the continuous rise in housing prices, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) took preemptive actions, introducing eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure the local banking system has sufficient resilience to cope with shocks should the property market reverse. These measures proved effective: the average mortgage loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties fell from 64% in 2009 to 46% by the end of 2018; the average debt-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% in 2010 to 34% by the end of 2018. Credit growth recorded a modest 4.4% increase during the year, with overall asset quality remaining strong. The non-performing loan ratio for retail banks further decreased to 0.5%, far below the international and local historical averages. Banking sector profits continued to grow last year, with the overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%. Several international banking groups achieved strong performance in their Hong Kong operations, becoming a key pillar of their group's profitability.\n\n# Sound and Virtuous Culture: Lead by Example\n\nIn terms of supervising the conduct of banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established a Bank Conduct Department in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers by banks and strengthen consumer protection. To achieve both symptomatic and root-cause solutions, in addition to setting out various regulatory requirements targeting the fundamental conduct of bank operations, we have vigorously promoted reforms to banking culture in recent years, encouraging banks to promote a sound culture through governance, incentive systems, and assessment and feedback mechanisms, striving to ensure that banks internally lead by example, thereby restoring and enhancing customers' trust and respect for banks at their core. Following the HKMA's provision of specific guidelines to all Hong Kong banks in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures for banking culture by the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments on corporate culture and the implementation of related measures, enabling the three pillars of a sound banking culture to be effectively implemented.\n\nAlthough the internet and mobile finance are global trends, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to promote inclusive finance last year, catering to communities unable to adopt new technologies. For example, we collaborated with the Hong Kong Association of Banks to drive the launch of elderly-friendly cash withdrawal services at convenience stores through the \"Easy Access\" platform, with the convenience store network expanding to over 300 stores; we also contacted Hong Kong Post to introduce the \"Senior Withdrawal Easy\" service at seven major post offices located in outlying islands and the New Territories. The banking industry responded to the HKMA's recommendations by actively increasing barrier-free facilities and providing inclusive banking services for people with disabilities and the general public. One example is the number of voice-guided ATMs, which increased more than tenfold within a year to over 700 units. Additionally, under the HKMA's active promotion, we expect banks to gradually establish more physical branches in remote areas and introduce mobile banking services, enhancing convenience for the public.\n\n# Smart Bank New Experience\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely collaborated with banks and the technology industry to launch the \"New Era of Smart Banking\" in September 2017, promoting the development and innovation of Hong Kong's fintech sector and offering citizens a new payment and banking service experience. A highlight of 2018 was the official launch of the \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" in September. It is a globally unique retail fast payment system that breaks down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, enabling citizens to enjoy 24\/7 real-time Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi fund transfers. The HKMA also simultaneously introduced the world's first \"shared QR code\" standard and application, allowing merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems through a single QR code. Since its launch, the FPS has been widely welcomed by the public. Within just half a year, registration records have exceeded 2.58 million accounts, with average daily transaction volume reaching 60,000 transactions, averaging HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 per transaction respectively.\n\nIn May last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines for the authorization of virtual banks, followed by 33 institutions submitting applications for virtual bank licenses. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have been issued, and they are expected to officially commence operations within the year. Virtual banks help promote Hong Kong's fintech development and innovation, providing innovative services and experiences for individuals and SMEs, and promoting inclusive finance.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released an Open API framework in July, with banks phasing in the opening of external interfaces for products and services in four stages, creating a more flexible and open fintech environment. This allows bank customers to more conveniently integrate account information, obtain information, and select services that better meet their needs. Within the year, a total of 42 new technology products were tested using the HKMA's fintech regulatory sandbox, with 28 of them completing the trial. The relevant products and services have been successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in conjunction with multiple banks officially launched eTradeConnect in October last year. This trade financing platform, which adopts \"distributed classification account technology,\" will enhance the efficiency of banks' approval processes for trade financing. eTradeConnect is currently testing connections to related platforms in other regions to promote cross-border trade financing activities.\n\nFinancial technology is not only widely applied in daily life but has also entered the fields of compliance and regulation in recent years. The authority encourages banks to use compliance technology (RegTech) to assist in handling daily operations, such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. At the same time, the authority is studying the use of supervisory technology (Suptech) to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Consolidate and Enhance Financial Strength\n\nThe competition between international financial centers is a contest of soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in economic, social, and technological development, seize opportunities, and constantly open up new development space for Hong Kong's financial sector. Green finance represents a major opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its bond and project financing markets. The HKMA supports and cooperates with the HKSAR government in developing green finance. In addition to preparing a government green bond issuance program worth 100 billion Hong Kong dollars, we hosted multiple green finance seminars last year, including two major international conferences, to enhance the market's understanding, awareness, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuers to participate in the government's green bond subsidy program launched last year and Hong Kong's green finance certification services. The scale of green bond issuance in Hong Kong last year exceeded 11 billion US dollars, more than three times that of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown growing interest in infrastructure and related projects. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016. The number of its collaborating partners has more than doubled to 95 institutions, making it an important platform for exchange in infrastructure financing within the region. Last year, the HKMA co-hosted its first high-level roundtable meeting with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council, discussing Hong Kong's unique advantages and role in supporting central state-owned enterprises' \"going global\" initiatives. This laid a solid foundation for future collaborative expansion of development opportunities between central state-owned enterprises and Hong Kong's financial and professional services sectors.\n"}

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

The exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority dated June 25, 2003, set out the allocation of their respective functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs, and also disclose that the Financial Secretary has delegated certain powers to the Monetary Authority. The relevant documents are public documents and can be accessed on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance, by the Financial Secretary, who holds control. The Ordinance requires the Exchange Fund to be primarily used for affecting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing the functions granted to him by that Ordinance, as well as other functions assigned by the Financial Secretary under other Ordinances. The Office of the Monetary Authority is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Monetary Authority is the Governor of the HKMA.\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under the Banking Ordinance, is responsible for regulating and supervising banking operations and the acceptance of deposits. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for handling the authorization of qualifications for licensed banks, restricted license banks, and companies accepting deposits in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance designates the Monetary Authority as the resolution mechanism authority for banking sector entities. The Ordinance grants the Monetary Authority a series of powers to carry out orderly resolution of the relevant entities, in order to reduce the risks posed to the stability and effective operation of Hong Kong's financial system by the unsustainable operations of the relevant entities.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance empower the Monetary Authority with certain powers relating to banking, securities, and mandatory provident fund operations.\n\nThe Insurance Industry Ordinance provides that the power of inspection and investigation regarding the insurance business of banks may be delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks in their compliance with the requirements of the ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance grants the Monetary Authority the responsibility to provide assistance in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger the disbursement of compensation to depositors of insolvent banks from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund.\n\nUnder the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance, the Monetary Authority may designate and supervise clearing and settlement systems that are crucial to the stability of Hong Kong's currency or to Hong Kong's function as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also authorizes the Monetary Authority to manage the licensing regime for stored value payment tools, and to designate retail payment systems and supervise the operation of such systems to ensure their safety and efficiency.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is part of the framework of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, but may appoint staff under terms and conditions of employment different from those of civil servants, in order to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialised knowledge. The CEO of the HKMA and its staff are all public officers. The daily operations of the HKMA are highly autonomous within the statutory powers granted or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for setting Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that the Currency Board system should be used to maintain currency stability, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including determining related strategies, tools, and implementation methods, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Director of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, is responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's financial system, as well as implementing policies to preserve Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. To pursue these policies, the Monetary Authority's responsibilities include:  \n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system  \n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market  \n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of statutory notes and coins  \n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems, and taking responsibility for operating these systems when appropriate  \n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority must act according to the power delegated by the Financial Secretary and be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has maintained a high degree of autonomy in the methods used for daily operations and implementing government policy objectives, while being supported by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the currency and banking system, effectively managing official reserves, developing and monitoring a resilient and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nIn order to effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the HKMA must gain the confidence of the public. Therefore, the HKMA fulfills its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public with a rigorous approach, and strives to address issues of significant public concern that involve the HKMA's responsibilities.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the HKMA is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. As the authority of the HKMA is established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. Furthermore, the HKMA recognizes its broader responsibilities, which include promoting public understanding of its role and objectives, and closely monitoring issues of concern to the public. When carrying out its daily operations and maintaining broad engagement with society, the HKMA remains committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:  \n- Under the statutory restrictions regarding market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and the disclosure of confidential information, to the extent possible, ensure that the financial sector and the public fully understand the HKMA's work;  \n- Ensure that the HKMA understands public sentiment and provides appropriate responses to public feedback.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency, while maintaining extensive media contacts and also publishing various bilingual journals and special publications. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials issued by the HKMA. In addition, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's office houses an information centre, divided into two parts: a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public for visits and use six days a week. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, using seminars and guided tours of the information centre to explain the HKMA's functions to the public, particularly students, and to enhance the public's financial knowledge. Detailed information on the HKMA's media liaison work, publications, and public education activities can be found in the \"Institutional Functions\" chapter.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively increased the frequency and detail of disclosures regarding the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board's account information. The HKMA began participating in the International Monetary Fund's \"Special Data Dissemination Standard\" programme in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the meeting records of the Currency Issuance Committee, which falls under the Advisory Committee on the Exchange Fund, as well as reports on the operations of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA's website has also included banking regulatory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is vital to enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to briefing the Legislative Council's Financial Affairs Committee three times a year on the HKMA's various work and policies, and answering related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives will also attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Financial Affairs Committee and Bill Committees from time to time to explain and discuss special matters, as well as assist legislators in reviewing draft ordinances.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Other Committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nThe Financial Secretary exercises control over the Exchange Fund with the advice of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. This provision stipulates that the Financial Secretary must consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary is the ex-officio Chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, while other members (including the Monetary Authority) are appointed by the Financial Secretary on the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in their individual capacities. Members are appointed for their expertise and experience, and their inclusion greatly benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. Their expertise and experience cover areas such as currency, finance, economy, investment, accounting, management, business, and law.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established five house committees, responsible for overseeing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's specific areas of work, and through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, report to the Financial Secretary and make recommendations. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee held a total of five meetings in 2018, discussing various matters related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, with most of these matters having been discussed in advance by the relevant house committees.\n\nThe Governance Committee monitors the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) performance and provides recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on matters including the HKMA's salary and service conditions, human resources policies, financial budget, and administrative and governance affairs. The Committee held a total of five meetings in 2018, covering the HKMA's expenditure budget, performance assessment, annual salary review, and strategic planning. The Committee also reviewed the HKMA's regularly submitted work reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the financial reporting procedures of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal control systems, as well as submits reports. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the HKMA's financial statements, the components and accounting principles used in preparing these statements, and together with external and internal auditors, reviewing the audit scope and results. None of the Audit Committee members hold any administrative functions within the HKMA. The Committee held a total of 2 meetings in 2018 and reviewed the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit (IA) Division.\n\nThe Currency Issuing Committee monitors the operation of the Currency Board system and reports on the situation of this pillar of Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system. The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Currency Board system operates in accordance with established policies, making recommendations for improving the system, and ensuring that the system's operations maintain high transparency. The HKMA regularly publishes the meeting records of the Currency Issuing Committee and submits reports on the operation of the Currency Board system to the Committee. The Committee held a total of four meetings in 2018.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n2018年香港經濟持續擴張，不過隨着金融狀況收緊及貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，增長動力於年內有所減弱。隨着全球經濟增長轉弱，預期2019年香港經濟增長亦會減慢。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n2018年香港經濟進一步擴張，不過按年增長速度由第1季的4.6%，逐步減慢至第4季的1.3%（表1），並拖累全年增長率由2017年的3.8%下降至3.0%。經濟擴張轉弱，反映本地需求增長減慢以及經濟持續受淨出口所拖累（圖1）。本地方面，私人消費在第1季強勁增長，但其後增長動力減弱，部分反映貿易保護主義升溫令不明朗因素增加，以及本地資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應。由於營商信心脆弱，整體投資支出的增長速度亦放緩。外圍方面，貨品出口於首3季大致保持平穩，但在第4季隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇而顯著轉差。貨品進口亦因為出口帶動的需求轉弱而放緩。相比之下，服務輸出錄得較快的全年增長，部分是受惠於訪港旅遊業表現蓬勃，而服務輸入則由於運輸、商業及其他服務增長而得以大致維持增長動力。按淨額計，貿易差額由2017年的順差轉為2018年的小幅逆差，並拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n表1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n圖1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n主要受到港元與美元負息差下的套息活動所影響，港元兌美元匯率在2018年大致回軟。尤其弱方兌換保證在4月、5月及8月被觸發，促使金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）所定，在7.85港元兌1美元的水平，向銀行購入港元及沽出美元。按照聯匯制度的設計，港元貨幣基礎因而收縮，表示銀行同業流動性減少，再加上市場預期美國加息，導致港元銀行同業拆息整體上升。由於銀行體系資金成本上升，銀行於9月下旬在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間上調後，調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。信貸增長方面，部分由於本地經濟增長放緩以及對外貿易表現轉弱，整體銀行貸款的增幅由2017年的16.1%，顯著減慢至2018年的4.4%。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力於2018年略為增加。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2017年的1.7%低位，升至2018年的2.6%，不過仍屬於溫和水平。當中的住屋租金組成項目增幅較快，反映較早前新簽訂私人住宅租金上升的影響（圖2）。更廣泛的分析顯示，名義勞工成本及商用物業租金增長略為加快，令本地成本壓力更趨明顯。隨着香港部分主要進口來源地通脹上升，進口價格通脹亦因而攀升。\n\n圖2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場狀況在2018年保持穩健（圖3）。失業率由2017年全年的3.1%下降至2018年的2.8%，是自1997年以來的最低水平。當中大部分主要服務行業的失業率都有所回落，特別是住宿及膳食服務業的跌幅更為顯著。隨着總就業人數及私營機構職位空缺進一步增加，整體勞工需求持續增強，而且勞動人口參與率亦輕微上升。在勞工市場狀況趨緊下，實質工資及收入進一步增加。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市走勢在2018年大幅逆轉。恒生指數在2017年強勁的上升動力帶動下，於2018年1月升上33,484點的歷史高位（圖4）。然而，隨着主要中央銀行收緊貨幣政策、中美貿易摩擦加劇及本地經濟增長放緩引起投資者的憂慮，市場的樂觀情緒急劇逆轉。恒生指數在10月下挫至24,586點的低位，在年底則收報25,846點，較一年前下跌13.6%。然而，平均每日成交額則由2017年的882億港元上升至1,074億港元，本港首次公開招股集資總額亦因數間從事新興及創科產業的企業上市而大幅增加。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2018年上半年保持暢旺，不過在下半年隨着中美貿易摩擦加劇、環球股市調整及本港最優惠利率上升而有所降溫。整體樓價在7月至12月期間由高位回落9%，然而全年計仍錄得2%的升幅（圖4）。由於一手及二手市場的買賣活動於下半年顯著減少，所以物業成交量在2018年亦較前一年下跌7%至57,247宗。此外，置業負擔能力仍然偏緊，樓價與收入比率以及收入槓桿比率分別為17.0及75.7，兩者均遠高於長期平均水平。另一方面，非住宅物業價格在2018年整體上升，惟接近年底時稍見回落。全年計，價格及租金均進一步上升，租金回報率則維持在低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n由於全球經濟增長放緩，預期2019年香港經濟增長將會減慢。尤其外圍環境充滿挑戰，預期香港出口表現仍會受壓。本地方面，雖然失業率低企及家庭收入增加將繼續支撐私人消費，但部分由於消費信心減弱及較早前的資產價格調整帶來的財富減值效應的影響，預期私人消費增長步伐會放緩。固定資本形成方面，雖然隨着房屋供應增加，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但面對經濟不明朗因素增加，企業對於資本投資可能會變得更為審慎。政府預測2019年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員的最新預測增幅則平均為2.3%。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n由於包括香港在內的全球增長放緩，外圍物價及本地成本壓力或會得到紓緩，因此預期通脹壓力在2019年仍保持溫和。近期新簽訂住宅租金回落，亦會對通脹產生壓抑作用。市場共識預測2019年整體通脹率為2.2%，政府預期基本通脹率則為2.5%。預期在經濟持續增長及訪港旅遊業維持暢旺下，勞工市場狀況會繼續偏緊。私營機構分析員預計失業率於2019年會維持於約3%的水平。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2019年經濟前景受貿易摩擦、美國貨幣政策未來方向、內地經濟表現、英國脫歐及其他地緣政治局勢等不明朗因素及風險所影響。另外，一旦上述的不明朗因素加劇並長期持續，金融市場情緒及營商信心或會大受影響，對本地資產市場及實體經濟活動構成下行壓力。\n\n另外，住宅物業市場受眾多外圍及本地因素所影響，其前景並不明朗。外圍方面，中美貿易摩擦的不確定性將有可能影響市場情緒、經濟前景及金融狀況，使香港物業市場前景繼續蒙上陰影。本地方面，雖然經濟增長放緩，但就業情況及收入增長仍大致穩定，或可支持住宅物業需求。本港利率的走勢某程度上視乎美國未來的政策利率變動，惟後者走勢並不明確。長遠而言，由於過去幾年住宅落成量有所增加，加上政府致力增加土地及房屋供應，預期房屋供求缺口或會收窄。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管外圍不利因素增加，例如中美貿易衝突、英國脫歐及利率正常化，令金融市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2018年仍然穩健。銀行體系的資本及流動性狀況穩健，資產質素保持良好。利率趨升令息差擴闊，刺激銀行盈利顯著增加。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2018年銀行體系繼續穩步增長，資產負債表擴大5.9%。面對經濟不明朗因素持續，例如主要經濟體之間的貿易衝突及加息等，企業在獲取新貸款方面變得較為保守。年內貸款總額增幅放緩至4.4%，而2017年為16.1%。有關增長受在香港使用的貸款（+6.5%）及在香港境外使用的貸款（+2%）同告增加帶動。另一方面，由於環球貿易環境不明朗，貿易融資下跌7.6%。中國內地相關貸款的增長亦由2017年的17.5%放緩至2018年的1.4%。\n\n銀行體系持有的債務證券總額在2018年底繼續佔總資產的22%，與2017年一樣。由於這些債務證券大部分為政府及銀行發行的投資級別債務證券，因此有關信用風險維持在低水平。\n\n就負債方而言，存款總額在2018年增加5%，較2017年（+8.7%）的增幅小。由於預期美國持續加息，部分銀行上調定期存款利率，吸引存戶將往來及儲蓄存款轉為定期存款，從而鎖定資金。往來及儲蓄存款佔存款總額的比例由對上一年的57.4%，降至2018年底的51.4%，導致資金成本上升。由於存款總額的增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2017年底的73%稍降至2018年底的72.6%（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系資本相當充裕，表示其具備強大緩衝以抵禦潛在衝擊。資本比率處於自實施《巴塞爾協定三》以來的歷史高位；本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率由2017年底的19.1%，增加至2018年底的20.3%（圖6）。\n\n圖6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2018年1月1日生效；該比率是一項非風險為本規定，旨在限制銀行體系過度累積槓桿。於2018年底，槓桿比率為8.0%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n圖7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，反映其具備強大能力，可有效承受來自潛在金融及經濟壓力的衝擊。短期流動性（涵蓋1個月期資金）方面，第1類機構的平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為167.6%，遠高於2018年適用的90%法定最低要求。第2類機構的平均流動性維持比率為54.3%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖8）。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

With global economic growth weakening, Hong Kong's economic growth is also expected to slow down in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Physical economic activities\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong's economy expanded further, although the year-on-year growth rate slowed gradually from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), dragging down the full-year growth rate from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected slower growth in local demand and continued drag from net exports (Chart 1). Locally, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter, but its growth momentum weakened afterward, partly reflecting increased uncertainty due to rising trade protectionism and wealth impairment effects from asset price adjustments. Due to fragile business confidence, the growth rate of overall investment spending also slowed. Externally, goods exports remained largely stable in the first three quarters but significantly deteriorated in the fourth quarter amid intensified US-China trade tensions. Goods imports also slowed due to weaker demand driven by exports. In contrast, service exports recorded faster full-year growth, partly benefiting from robust performance in inbound tourism, while service imports managed to maintain growth momentum largely due to growth in transport, business, and other services. On a net basis, the trade balance turned from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Domestic GDP Growth by Expenditure Items (Compared to Previous Period)\n\nNote: The quarter-on-quarter increase or decrease in the seasonally adjusted total of local fixed capital formation is not available.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\nChart 1: Contribution of Components to the Growth of Real Local GDP.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Currency Conditions\n\nMainly affected by carry trade activities under the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar兑US dollar exchange rate softened broadly in 2018. Particularly, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April, May, and August, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at the level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, in accordance with the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). According to the design of the LERS, the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base thus contracted, indicating reduced interbank liquidity. Combined with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, the overall Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBORs) rose. Due to increased funding costs within the banking system, banks raised the most favorable loan rate by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the upward adjustment of the US Federal Funds Rate target range in late September. In terms of credit growth, partly due to slower local economic growth and weaker external trade performance, the overall increase in bank loans slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflation pressures slightly increased in 2018. After excluding the impact of the government's one-time relief measures, the core inflation rate rose from 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, but remained at a moderate level. Among these, the housing rent component increased more rapidly, reflecting the impact of earlier increases in private residential rents (Chart 2). Broader analysis shows that the growth in nominal labor costs and commercial property rents slightly accelerated, making local cost pressures more pronounced. With inflation rising in some of Hong Kong's major import sources, import price inflation also rose accordingly.\n\nChart 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation. Data source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained resilient in 2018 (Chart 3). The unemployment rate fell from 3.1% for the whole year of 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. Among which, the unemployment rate in most major service sectors declined, especially in the accommodation and food services sector, where the decline was more pronounced. With further increases in total employment and vacancies in private sector institutions, overall labour demand continued to strengthen, and the labour force participation rate also rose slightly. Under the tighter labour market conditions, real wages and income continued to rise.\n\nFigure 3: Labour Market Conditions  \nData source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n#stock market\n\nThe movements of the Hong Kong stock market drastically reversed in 2018. Driven by the strong upward momentum in 2017, the Hang Seng Index rose to a historical high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, as major central banks tightened monetary policy, US-China trade tensions intensified, and slowing local economic growth caused investor concerns, market optimism sharply reversed. The Hang Seng Index plunged to a low of 24,586 points in October, closing at 25,846 points by year-end, a 13.6% decline compared to a year earlier. However, the average daily turnover rose from HK$882 billion in 2017 to HK$1,074 billion. The total fundraising from initial public offerings in Hong Kong also significantly increased due to the listing of several companies in emerging and technology sectors.\n\nChart 4 Asset Prices  \nData Source: Rates and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market remained robust in the first half of 2018, but cooled slightly in the second half as US-China trade tensions intensified, global stock markets adjusted, and the local most favorable interest rate increased. Overall housing prices fell by 9% from their high level between July and December, although they still recorded a 2% increase for the year as a whole (Chart 4). Due to significantly reduced buying and selling activities in both new and second-hand markets in the second half of the year, property transaction volume in 2018 fell by 7% compared to the previous year to 57,247 transactions. Additionally, affordability of home purchases remained tight, with the housing price-to-income ratio and income leverage ratio at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both far above long-term average levels. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, though they slightly declined towards the end of the year. For the year as a whole, prices and rents both further increased, while rental yield remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# economic environment\n\nDue to the global economic slowdown, it is expected that Hong Kong's economic growth in 2019 will slow down. Particularly, the external environment remains challenging, and Hong Kong's export performance is still expected to face pressure. Locally, although low unemployment rates and increased household income are expected to continue supporting private consumption, the growth of private consumption is anticipated to moderate due to weakened consumer confidence and the lingering effects of wealth impairment from earlier asset price adjustments. In terms of fixed capital formation, while housing supply increases should lead to steady growth in building and construction activities, businesses may become more prudent in their capital investment decisions in the face of heightened economic uncertainty. The Government forecasts that the real local GDP growth rate in 2019 will range between 2% and 3%, while the average growth rate predicted by private sector analysts is 2.3%.\n\n# inflation and labour market\n\nDue to the global growth slowdown, including Hong Kong, external price pressures and local cost pressures are expected to ease, thus inflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2019. Recent declines in newly signed residential rental rates are also expected to have a restraining effect on inflation. Market consensus forecasts the overall inflation rate for 2019 at 2.2%, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.5%. It is expected that under sustained economic growth and the continued robustness of inbound tourism, labor market conditions will remain tight. Private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain around the 3% level in 2019.\n\n# Uncertainty Factors and Risks\n\nThe 2019 economic outlook is affected by uncertainties and risks including trade tensions, the future direction of US monetary policy, mainland China's economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical situations. Additionally, should the aforementioned uncertainties intensify and persist in the long term, financial market sentiment and business confidence may be significantly affected, exerting downward pressure on local asset markets and physical economic activities.\n\nIn addition, the residential property market is influenced by numerous external and local factors, with its outlook remaining uncertain. Externally, the uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions could affect market sentiment, economic outlook, and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over the outlook for Hong Kong's property market. Locally, although economic growth has slowed, employment conditions and income growth remain broadly stable, which may provide some support for residential property demand. The trajectory of Hong Kong interest rates to some extent depends on future policy rate changes in the US, though the latter's trajectory remains unclear. In the long term, due to increased residential completions over the past few years, combined with the government's efforts to increase land and housing supply, the housing supply-demand gap is expected to narrow.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nNevertheless, external factors have heightened, such as the US-China trade conflict, UK's Brexit, and interest rate normalisation, which have intensified financial market volatility. Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2018. The banking system's capital and liquidity conditions remained robust, with asset quality remaining good. Rising interest rates enabled interest rate spreads to widen, stimulating a significant increase in bank profitability.\n\n# Assets and liabilities table movements\n\nIn 2018, the banking system continued to grow steadily, with its assets and liabilities expanding by 5.9%. Facing ongoing economic uncertainty, such as trade conflicts between major economies and interest rate hikes, enterprises became more cautious in obtaining new loans. The total loan growth rate slowed to 4.4% during the year, compared to 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans used in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside Hong Kong (+2%). On the other hand, trade financing fell by 7.6% due to an uncertain global trade environment. Growth in related loans for Mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking sector accounted for 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. Owing to the fact that most of these debt securities are investment-grade debt securities issued by the government and banks, the related credit risk has remained at a low level.\n\nFrom the liability side, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a smaller increase compared to 2017 (+8.7%). Due to expectations of continued interest rate hikes in the US, some banks raised time deposit interest rates to attract depositors to convert their demand and savings deposits into time deposits, thereby locking in funds. The proportion of demand and savings deposits in total deposits fell from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% by the end of 2018, leading to an increase in funding costs. As the growth of total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio slightly declined from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at the end of 2018 (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking Sector\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe banking sector's capital is sufficiently ample, indicating that it has a strong buffer to withstand potential shocks. The capital ratio has reached a historical high since the implementation of Basel III; the comprehensive total capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions increased from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 6 Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Local Registered Authorized Institutions\n\nBasel III leverage ratio became effective on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based requirement aimed at limiting excessive accumulation of leverage in the banking sector. By the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, much higher than the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 Comprehensive Leverage Ratio of Local Registered Authorized Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Conditions\n\nThe banking system's liquidity conditions remained resilient, reflecting its strong capability to effectively withstand shocks from potential financial and economic pressures. In terms of short-term liquidity (covering 1-month term funds), the average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 167.6% in the fourth quarter, far exceeding the 90% statutory minimum requirement applicable in 2018. The average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also far higher than the 25% statutory minimum requirement (Chart 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Nevertheless, the operation of the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and currency markets remained smooth and orderly. The Linked exchange rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand strong shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe main objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, i.e., to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts the Currency Board system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% support for the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be adjusted accordingly, maintaining a 100% alignment with changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificate(s) of Indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by three issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the Government\n- The aggregate balance in settlement accounts held by banks at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., the total balance)\n- Bills and bonds of the Exchange Fund issued on behalf of the Government by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the Convertibility Undertaking. If market demand for Hong Kong dollars exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking exchange rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing aggregate surplus and causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to the exchange rate band of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if there is excess supply of Hong Kong dollars, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking exchange rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing aggregate surplus and driving up the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back to the exchange rate band.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, which triggered carry trade activities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, which had been set at the 7.85 level since 2005, was first triggered. For the whole year of 2018, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times, specifically 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Nevertheless, Hong Kong dollar transactions remained smooth and orderly, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuating around the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking rate of 7.85 between mid-April and mid-September (Chart 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened, partly reflecting the tightening of interbank liquidity as holiday periods, quarter-end, and year-end approached, which triggered the unwinding of some carry trade positions. Meanwhile, to some extent, the Hong Kong dollar was also supported by improved stock market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2018.\n\nChart 1 2018 Market Exchange Rate\n\nOwing to the triggering of the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, the aggregate reserves and the total outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds fell from 122.68 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2017 to 113.62 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2018 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA, in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), purchased a total of 103.5 billion Hong Kong dollars at the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking exchange rate of 7.85 in response to banks' requests. Consequently, the aggregate reserves fell from 179.8 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2017 to 76.4 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2018. The total outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds remained largely unchanged during the year. The Monetary Base continued to be fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, the total surplus and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds amounted to 11,362 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nChart 2 2018 Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# Currency Market\n\nDue to the reduction in interbank liquidity following the triggering of the weak-side convertibility undertaking, as well as market expectations of US interest rate hikes, Hong Kong interbank rates generally rose during 2018. Driven by increased funding demands related to new share offerings and seasonal liquidity demands, short-term interbank rates experienced greater volatility (Chart 3). Overall, short-term interbank rates remained below the base rate throughout 2018. In view of rising funding costs in the banking system, banks increased the prime lending rate by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the upward adjustment of the US federal funds rate target range in late September.\n\nIn response to the US federal funds rate target range being raised a total of 100 basis points across four instances during the year, from 1.25 to 1.50% to 2.25 to 2.50%, the basic interest rate was raised a total of 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, increasing from 1.75% to 2.75%. The adjustment to the basic interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of the lower bound of the US federal funds rate target range plus 50 basis points, or at the average level of the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates, whichever is higher.\n\nChart 3 2018 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs)\n\nThe discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate expanded in the first four months, broadly following the movements of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. The 12-month forward exchange rate points for the Hong Kong dollar reached -620 points in mid-April (Chart 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar narrowed, the discount on the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate slightly narrowed, before expanding again in the fourth quarter. Overall, Hong Kong's currency market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from 103 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2017 to 402 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2018.\n\nChart 4 2018 US dollar against Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), implemented since 1983, has been a cornerstone in maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system. It has demonstrated its ability to withstand significant shocks under repeated regional and global financial crises. Due to the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar, the Weak-side Convertibility Undertaking, which is part of the LERS design, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August. Capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable process of interest rate normalization and a normal operation under the LERS. To enhance understanding among all sectors regarding the related operations and mechanisms of the LERS, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made efforts to explain the technical details of the LERS to the public and to demonstrate the resilience of Hong Kong's financial system in responding to shocks. The government also firmly maintains the LERS. The stability of foreign exchange and money markets further strengthens public confidence in the government's commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and store of value. During the 2018 Fourth Article Consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reaffirmed its support for the LERS and noted that the LERS remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, serving as a pillar of stability. It helps ensure sustained economic growth, maintains competitiveness, and promotes the smooth operation of Hong Kong's vast financial services sector.\n\nIn view of the critical role of a resilient banking system in the normal operation of the Linked Exchange Rate System, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintains supervision over banks' corporate, property-related, and Mainland China-related loans to ensure the banking system has the capacity to withstand shocks. Banks hold a large amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds, which can be used through the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant fluctuations in interest rates. The HKMA is always prepared to adjust the issuance volume of Exchange Fund bills and bonds to provide additional liquidity to address potential sharp outflows of funds from Hong Kong dollars. The HKMA also reminds the public to prudently manage market and interest rate risks and to be prepared for potential market volatility.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Currency Board's accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated for supporting the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets relative to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 109.9% on December 31 (Chart 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's vast fiscal resources can serve as a powerful backstop to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability when facing unexpected shocks.\n\nChart 5 2018 Daily Support Ratio Change\n\n# Currency Issuance Committee\n\nThe Monetary Authority Committee (MAC), a sub-committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for overseeing and examining issues related to the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial system. In 2018, the topics discussed by the MAC included the potential impact of multiple central banks jointly exiting unconventional monetary policies on the supply of US dollar loans to offshore banks in Hong Kong, the interest rate sensitivity of demand for Hong Kong dollars, and the operational mechanisms and theoretical frameworks of the Linked Exchange Rate System since the implementation of three optimization measures. The meeting minutes of the MAC and the Currency Board operational system reports submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Financial Research Centre (Research Centre) continues to support research on monetary policy, the banking sector, and financial areas. Over the past 4 years, the Research Centre has been more focused on policy-related research, as evidenced by the seminars and visiting scholars program it has hosted. On one hand, the Research Centre collaborates with major central banks and policy research institutions to jointly host more policy-related seminars. On the other hand, the Research Centre launched a specialized research scholars program in 2016 to support more research projects related to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's policy-making.\n\nIn 2018, the Research Centre invited a total of 16 research scholars to visit and published 25 research papers. During the year, the Research Centre also hosted four international seminars:  \n- The \"9th China Economic Annual International Conference,\" held in January, with the theme \"China's Real Estate Market and Its Impact on Economic and Financial Stability.\" The conference was co-organized by the Research Centre, the Market Economy Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council, and the Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China. It focused on discussing topics and risks related to China's real estate market.  \n- The \"Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Framework\" seminar, held in October and co-organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). This seminar was one of the celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the BIS's Asia-Pacific region office in Hong Kong, aiming to explore the role of exchange rates within monetary policy frameworks.  \n- The \"Annual Conference on Central Bank Financial Market Microstructure 2018,\" held in November. The seminar discussed theoretical research, empirical findings, and recent developments related to policy impacts on financial market microstructures.  \n- The \"China Experts' Network Seminar on 'China's New Era,'\" held in November and co-organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The seminar discussed urgent issues facing China's economy and their impact on the global economy, with particular emphasis on policy issues relevant to central bank decision-makers. This was the first time the China Experts' Network Seminar was held outside Europe.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

The effectiveness of liquidity and credit risk management systems of authorized institutions continued to be the HKMA's regulatory focus this year. In view of the continued increase in cyber threats and the broader adoption of fintech in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of authorized institutions' technology risk management and business operational recovery capabilities. The HKMA also issued the revised guideline on \"Authorization of Virtual Banks\" in May and began processing applications for virtual bank authorization. In terms of conduct supervision, the HKMA took further measures to enhance oversight of the practices used by authorized institutions in the sale of investment and insurance products, promote barrier-free banking services for disabled individuals, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nWith financial crimes becoming increasingly complex and globalized, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to harness new technology and risk-based approaches to enhance Hong Kong's capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing systems. The HKMA has made substantial progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards, and large exposure risk limits. Additionally, the HKMA has strengthened communication with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strive to ensure Hong Kong has a credible authorized institution disposal mechanism, including the introduction of rules with minimum loss-absorbing capacity requirements to address a major obstacle in the feasibility of handling authorized institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. To achieve this goal, it is essential to establish and maintain a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the essential financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even in extreme cases through disorderly closures. As the regulatory authority, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays an important role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover to normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent closures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as authorizing licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\"). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure the financial system is entirely risk-free, and Hong Kong's prudential regulatory system was not established to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution mechanism authorities, the Monetary Authority strives to ensure that authorized institutions can be orderly resolved should they become unsustainable. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution mechanism, under which the Monetary Authority serves as the resolution authority for several financial institutions, including authorized institutions. To establish a smoothly operating Hong Kong resolution mechanism, it is necessary to formulate resolution legislation and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the Monetary Authority's operational capacity to manage the failure of authorized institutions. To effectively carry out the aforementioned tasks, the Monetary Authority needs to adopt approaches consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Regulatory Work Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a total of 187 non-onsite reviews in 2018, covering a wide range including CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations and risk management, as well as the business strategies of authorized institutions in response to fintech development. To continue enhancing the risk governance levels of authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 27 meetings with the boards of directors or their committees of authorized institutions, and followed up on the progress of implementing corporate governance guidelines. Additionally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 28 trilateral meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to non-on-site review work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to conduct regular on-site inspections, complemented by special assessments to examine areas assessed as higher risk. During the year, the HKMA carried out a total of 392 on-site inspections and special assessments, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management in its reviews and assessments. Other key areas include technology risk and business operational risk management, as well as measures to combat money laundering and controls on terrorist financing. The HKMA has also increased the frequency of on-site inspections and special assessments targeting liquidity and market risk management, as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Special inspection teams also conduct on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related operations.\n\nTable 1 sets out the summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2018.\n\n# Credit Risk Supervision\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nIn 2018, credit growth slowed, with the total loan amount increasing by 4.4% for the whole year, compared to an increase of 16.1% in 2017 (Table 2). Trade financing decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was primarily due to the increasingly uncertain global economic and trade environment, leading to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total related loans in Mainland China increased by 1.4% to 42,490 billion Hong Kong dollars by the end of 2018, lower than the 2017 growth rate (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Mainland China Related Loan Growth\n\nThe asset quality of authorized institutions remained resilient in 2018. The specific classified loan ratio for retail banks fell from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, well below the long-term average level of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the specific classified loan ratio for the overall banking sector declined from 0.68% to 0.55%. In terms of Mainland China-related loans, the specific classified loan ratio for retail banks fell from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, while the overall banking sector's related ratio also declined from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA strengthened its regulatory measures to ensure that authorized institutions continued to adopt prudent credit risk management guidelines. In particular, the HKMA proactively sought to understand the background and structure of large corporations, thereby enhancing the oversight system for corporate credit risk. Additionally, the HKMA also conducted special topic assessments focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management for large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, the credit risk governance framework, risk management for property developers' loans, secured loans, and policy-backed loans.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018, but signs of easing emerged in the second half of the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures introduced since October 2009 have enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system to cope with potential reversals in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans fell from 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in September 2009, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt-to-income ratio also declined from 41% when the relevant ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010, to 34% in December 2018 (Chart 1).\n\nChart 1: Average mortgage loan-to-value ratio and repayment-to-income ratio of new residential mortgage loans\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nThe technology risks faced by the banking sector remain high. In 2016, the HKMA launched the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework.\" The first phase of the implementation arrangements covers 30 authorized institutions, including all major banks, which have completed three stages of assessment: self-assessment of their risk levels, maturity assessment, and (if applicable) risk information-driven cyber attack and defense simulation tests. These assessments help authorized institutions identify areas for improvement in their operations and take corrective measures to strengthen their cyber defenses. Meanwhile, the HKMA has developed a timeline for the second and third phases of the implementation arrangements, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. This year, the HKMA will conduct on-site reviews to focus on examining the cybersecurity control measures, outsourcing arrangements, and information technology governance of authorized institutions.\n\n# Smart Bank\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with the banking sector on the 7 measures promoting smart banking, which were announced in September 2017, to foster the development of fintech in Hong Kong. In terms of regulation, the HKMA issued a revised version of the \"Authorization of Virtual Banks\" guidelines in May. Additionally, under the \"Banking Easy\" initiative, the HKMA has streamlined regulatory requirements related to remote account opening, online lending, and online wealth management. These optimized regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking user experience. The scope of the \"Banking Easy\" initiative was expanded in September to promote banks' adoption of financial compliance technology (Regtech), with three new focus areas including monitoring technologies to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism, financial compliance technology for prudent risk management and compliance, and \"machine-readable\" regulatory requirements.\n\nMr. Yuen Kwok-hang, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, delivered a speech at the \"Hong Kong Bankers' Summit 2018\", hosted by the Hong Kong Banking Society, titled \"Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking\".\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Liquidity and Market Risks\n\nWith the continued normalization of US monetary policy, the HKMA has strengthened its regulation of liquidity risk to ensure authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risks. This year, the HKMA conducted a round of special assessments to evaluate the preparations of authorized institutions for the possible tightening of USD liquidity, as well as their internal capabilities for liquidity stress testing. In addition, the HKMA also monitors the situation regarding authorized institutions' compliance with the \"Net Stable Funding Ratio\" requirements that took effect in January.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the market risk management of bond portfolios of authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a special on-site review targeting the margin and risk mitigation standards for the Global Foreign Exchange Code and non-central settlement over-the-counter derivatives, in order to examine the compliance of authorized institutions with new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# Anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism funds\n\nThe Hong Kong Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Risk Assessment Report, published by the Government in April, noted that Hong Kong's banking system faces a high money laundering threat, similar to other international financial centres, reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threats faced by Hong Kong originate not only from local criminal activities but to a greater extent from overseas activities. These overseas activities include illegal gains from corruption abroad, fraudulent activities by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions arising from Hong Kong's status as a payment and trade hub. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Government formulated a policy statement on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, setting out responses to these threats. The objective is to enhance the resilience of the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism systems while also attracting and facilitating legitimate businesses.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 came into effect on 1 March, introducing amendments that include granting flexibility in verifying customer identities to align with the development of authorized institutions utilizing technology to facilitate customer account opening. The new legislation also expands the scope, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to assume responsibility for anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, thereby comprehensively strengthening the system against money laundering and terrorist financing. These amendments, together with revisions to the Companies Ordinance aimed at enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership, help authorized institutions carry out their work in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism.\n\nTo consolidate and further strengthen communication with authorized institutions regarding anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism policies and regulatory approaches, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a new unit titled \"Regulatory Approaches to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism\" under the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" in October. This was accompanied by the \"Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)\" aligned with relevant legislative amendments, aiming to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce barriers for authorized institutions in adopting new technologies under the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regimes.\n\nThe role of information sharing in combating money laundering and terrorist financing systems is becoming increasingly important. With the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), the banking sector has actively participated in the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Committee and has already achieved tangible results. The review of the pilot program for the intelligence committee was launched at the end of 2018 and is expected to be completed at the beginning of 2019.\n"}

轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Seven measures aimed at promoting the banking and payment industries to develop and apply financial technology have made good progress within the year, with the successful launch of the Faster Payment System \"FPS\" serving as the best example.\n\nOptimization measures have been launched for the mutual access plan between Mainland China's and Hong Kong's capital markets, alongside the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, further strengthening Hong Kong's unique position as the principal gateway to Mainland China. Hong Kong's status as the global offshore renminbi business hub has also become more stable, with robust development of local renminbi financial activities.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to creating new opportunities and further enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centers, and the green bond market. The HKMA has also strengthened its market promotion plan to promote Hong Kong's strengths to overseas and mainland stakeholders. On the international stage, the HKMA plays a leading role in multiple regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong's expertise and commitment in related international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong's position as Asia's fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to implementing seven measures announced in September 2017, aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment sectors. Major progress achieved within the year on these seven initiatives to drive smart banking includes:\n\n- Successfully launched the Faster Payment System \"Faster Payment System (FPS)\" to fully connect different banks and stored value payment tools (collectively referred to as \"e-wallets\");  \n- Published the framework for banking open application programming interfaces (open API) and promoted the industry to implement open APIs;  \n- Enhanced fintech research and talent training;  \n- Strengthened cross-border fintech collaboration;  \n- Revised the \"Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks\" and processed applications for virtual bank licenses;  \n- The upgraded version of the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox\" (FSS 2.0) operates smoothly; and  \n- Expanded \"Banking Easy\" to promote banks to adopt financial compliance technology.\n\nThe Fintech Promotion Office (FFO) under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), together with the various banking departments of the HKMA, plays an important role in promoting the implementation of these measures.\n\nWith the implementation of optimization measures for the mutual market access plan between mainland China and Hong Kong's capital markets, Hong Kong's unique position as the main gateway to mainland China has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the Bond Connect's real-time gross settlement (RTGS) model and the State Council's announcement of tax exemption arrangements for overseas investors in China's domestic bond market have further enhanced the plan's efficiency and appeal. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also closely collaborated with mainland authorities to explore and implement multiple financial support measures, facilitating individuals and businesses living, working, and operating in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Hong Kong's offshore renminbi business continues to thrive, with the renminbi deposit liquidity pool rising by 6% year-on-year to 657.7 billion yuan; the average daily transaction value of the renminbi real-time payment settlement (RTGS) system reached a high level of 101.01 billion yuan.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. To promote the development of Hong Kong's bond market, the HKMA has implemented the \"Bond Subsidy Pilot Programme\" proposed in the Budget, providing funding to institutions issuing bonds for the first time in Hong Kong, and working closely with the government to revise legislation, expanding the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemptions under the \"Eligible Debt Instruments Scheme.\" The HKMA has also intensified its market promotion activities, promoting Hong Kong's strengths to overseas and mainland stakeholders, including organizing various large-scale and thematic outreach events to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) leads multiple regional and international committees. The HKMA currently serves as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulatory Cooperation under the Financial Stability Board, as a member of the Task Force on Regulatory and Implementation Guidelines under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and as Chairman of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Meeting (EMEAP).\n\nThe safe and effective operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. In 2018, the four RTGS systems handling interbank transactions, the Debt Instruments Central Settlement System (CMU system), and the Hong Kong Data Repository achieved 100% system availability, surpassing the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts at two central securities custody institutions in Mainland China, the CMU system continues to assist in settling Northbound Bond Connect transactions and holds debt securities for relevant CMU system members.\n\nTo enhance the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payment sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designated two additional retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), bringing the number of systems under HKMA supervision to six. The HKMA also oversees 16 licensed stored value payment tool operators. These licensees are actively launching new products and services, committed to providing customers with more choices and a better user experience. Meanwhile, the coverage of electronic cheques and electronic bill payment and collection services has further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions in Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# 2018 Review\n\n# Hong Kong as Asia's fintech hub\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced seven initiatives to promote smart banking in September 2017, aimed at assisting the banking sector in elevating to a higher level and seizing the vast opportunities brought by the integration of banking and technology. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing these measures and in transforming Hong Kong's financial ecosystem within the year.\n\n# FPS\n\nThe \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS) was successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored value payment tool users to conduct cross-bank instant fund transfers in Hong Kong dollars (HKD) and renminbi (RMB) anytime and anywhere, by simply entering the recipient's mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored value payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with real-time payment services and\/or account binding services.\n\n\"The 'Faster Payment System' (FPS) has already received over 2 million registrations within 3.5 months, accounting for 27% of Hong Kong's population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total amount exceeding 104.9 billion Hong Kong dollars and 2.75 billion yuan.\"\n\nThe HKMA launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Shared QR Code Standard and related mobile application \"HKQR\" in the same month. It is the world's first mobile application to integrate multiple QR codes into a single comprehensive QR code, facilitating merchants, especially SMEs, to accept payment schemes from different payment service providers using a single QR code, without needing to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface (API)\n\nAn Open API refers to enabling third-party service providers to access relevant banking data, thereby more effectively and conveniently integrating banking services with those from other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services in a secure environment using a single system. To promote the development and provision of Open APIs in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued an Open API framework in July. This framework adopts risk-based principles and implements various Open API functionalities in four phases. As of January 31, 2019, 20 banks had opened approximately 500 Open API interfaces in the first phase, covering data on over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Technology Research and Talent Training\n\nBased on the proof-of-concept results of the trade finance initiative led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), a consortium of multiple Hong Kong banks launched the trade finance platform \"TradeLink\" in October, which is built on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The platform is aimed at reducing errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade finance processes. As of the end of 2018, 12 banks have joined as members of the consortium. In October, \"TradeLink\" signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the European trade finance platform \"we.trade\" to conduct a proof-of-concept for connecting the two platforms. The HKMA is also simultaneously exploring opportunities for \"TradeLink\" to connect with other regions, including collaborating with Singapore's Monetary Authority to launch the \"Global Trade Connectivity Network.\"\n\nMr. Norman, the Chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), at the \"eTradeConnect\" launch ceremony.\n\nTo nurture more FinTech specialists, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) in January to launch the upgraded version of the \"FinTech Talent Development Programme\" (FCAS 2.0). FCAS 2.0 features four initiatives tailored for young talent at different stages of their career development. Over 200 students have benefited from the programme.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from left), attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony alongside Dr. Lam Ka-lei, Chairman of Digital Hong Kong (first from left), Mr. Wang Mingxin, Chairman of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (second from right), and Mr. Wong Hark Keung, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Science Park Company (first from right).\n\n# cross-border collaboration\n\nAfter signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal Government Financial Development Services Office (Shenzhen Financial Office) in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to strengthen its collaboration with Shenzhen in the field of fintech. This included the HKMA's sponsorship of the \"Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Programme,\" allowing 50 students to undertake a six-week internship at multiple well-known companies in Shenzhen, experiencing the local fintech ecosystem; and jointly co-organising the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Award\" for the second time with the Shenzhen Financial Office.\n\nMr. Lee Tak-chee, Deputy Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (second from the right), spoke with the first batch of Shenzhen fintech summer interns.\n\nThe Monetary Authority also signed a fintech collaboration agreement with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority, the Abu Dhabi International Financial Centre Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Brazilian Central Bank in 2018, to promote fintech collaboration.\n\nIn August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and 11 financial regulatory authorities and related institutions announced the \"Global Financial Innovation Network\" plan. The network aims to provide more effective ways for innovative companies to interact with regulatory authorities and promote collaboration between regulatory authorities on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Bank\n\nIntroducing virtual banks is expected to add new momentum to the application of financial technology in Hong Kong and bring new experiences to digital bank customers. Virtual banks target retail customers, including individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus also help promote inclusive finance. After public consultation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued the revised guidelines on the authorization of virtual banks in May, and received approximately 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Fintech Regulatory Sandbox\n\nThe usage of the sandbox has been steadily increasing during the year. To assist in establishing an ecosystem for financial compliance technology, the sandbox has been open to related initiatives since September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 fintech or technology products had been approved to use the sandbox for testing, of which 28 have completed the pilot testing, and the relevant products have also been launched into the market thereafter. The HKMA also received 220 cases involving the use of the \"Fintech Regulatory Chatroom,\" aiming to obtain regulatory feedback on fintech projects during their early conceptual stages. Of which approximately 70% of the cases were from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

Global stock markets generally declined, with US Treasury bond yields also rising following four rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. In the rising interest rate environment, the US dollar strengthened. Some emerging markets faced severe political and economic pressures domestically, leading to significant depreciation of their currencies. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$10.9 billion in investment income in 2018.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the delegated powers and the terms of the delegated powers granted by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Framework\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee sets the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) Protection of capital;  \n(b) Ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;  \n(c) Ensure that liquid funds are sufficient to maintain currency and financial stability; and  \n(d) Subject to compliance with the above (a) to (c), strive to maximize investment returns in order to protect the fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe aforementioned objectives comprehensively take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets and, in accordance with the regulations of the Currency Board system, provides full support for the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and stock markets of member countries of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization, to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts a prudent and incremental approach to diversify part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value cap of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund's cumulative surplus, plus the total amount of future Fund and Exchange Fund subsidiary deposits linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe strategic asset portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund's accounts. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, the investment performance assessment of the Exchange Fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund from time to time accepts deposits from financial reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, but primarily excluding the Future Fund. The interest rate on deposits in the Future Fund is linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate determined by the portfolio's proportion. As of the end of 2018, the Future Fund's proportion in the investment portfolio and long-term growth portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the configuration indicated by the investment benchmark, shows the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline to conduct tactical asset allocation in order to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark configuration (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark configurations is referred to as \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, establishes the investment benchmark and tracking error limit. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can select positions within the permissible range of strategic deviation to profit from short-term market changes.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Exchange Fund Investment Office in August, to house investment and related risk management functions. The office's members are responsible for directly managing approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio is invested in the global fixed income market and executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategy through derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to manage approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, in order to achieve sustainable returns and enable the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as gain insights and expertise in professional investment techniques.\n\nThe related expenses of hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding tax, and other taxes. These expenses are mainly affected by market factors and vary each year.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, highlighting the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The HKMA has enhanced its risk assessment to align with the increasingly diversified investments of the Exchange Fund; it also employs risk control tools to evaluate market risks under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts a detailed analysis of investment performance factors to identify the causes behind varying performance outcomes, thereby assessing how to fully utilize the investment management capabilities of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" published by the Securities and Futures Commission. These principles aim to assist investors in determining how best to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, applicable to the selection, appointment, and oversight procedures for external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage Hong Kong equity portfolios must adhere to the Principles of Responsible Ownership when managing these investments. Overall, the HKMA has incorporated ESG factors into its internal processes for investment and related oversight activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of relevant ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into investment processes. Additionally, to promote international collaboration on responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to promote business and investment decisions based on long-term goals.\n\n# Exchange Fund's performance\n\n# 2018 financial market\n\nIn 2018, several risk factors previously underestimated by the market emerged one by one, including the pace of US interest rate normalisation, the impact of the US government's foreign trade policies and protectionism on global trade, as well as geopolitical risks, leading to significant volatility and adjustments in global financial markets.\n\nThe escalation of the US-China trade dispute has caused significant concerns among investors, leading emerging markets and Hong Kong's stock markets to fluctuate downward since early January. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 27% from its high in that month. Since the fourth quarter, major European and American stock markets also sharply declined, recording double-digit declines. Overall for 2018, global stock markets generally declined, with the MSCI Global Index, which covers developed market stocks, falling 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index also declining 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, US Treasury yields rose broadly in 2018 due to the normalization of US monetary policy. However, the bond market remained volatile throughout the year. For example, the 10-year US Treasury yield rose from approximately 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a 7-year record high of 3.2% in November, but by the end of the year it softened to 2.7% due to investor concerns over the US-China trade dispute and a shift towards risk-averse investments.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened during the year as it followed US interest rate hikes. The US dollar index rose 4.4%, while major currencies such as the euro and renminbi fell against the US dollar by about 5%. Additionally, some emerging markets saw their currencies further weaken as they were affected by unstable domestic political situations and economies. For example, the Argentine peso and Turkish lira fell by about 50% and 30% respectively against the US dollar. In contrast, demand for safe-haven investments pushed the yen against the US dollar to rise 2.7%.\n\nTable 1 sets out the performance of main currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1 2018 Market Returns\n\n# Exchange Fund's performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded 10.9 billion Hong Kong dollars in investment income in 2018, including 57.4 billion Hong Kong dollars in gains from bond investments, 20.7 billion Hong Kong dollars in losses from Hong Kong stock investments, 38.7 billion Hong Kong dollars in losses from other stock investments, a 9 billion Hong Kong dollar decrease in foreign exchange valuation for non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and 21.9 billion Hong Kong dollars in other investment gains held by the Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a 500 million Hong Kong dollar valuation decrease.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Exchange Fund's total asset value reached 405.49 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was 283.6 billion Hong Kong dollars, among which private equity amounted to 191.1 billion Hong Kong dollars and real estate was 92.5 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total amount already committed but not yet drawn down for investment was 202.4 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) recorded a rate of return of 0.3% in 2018, with the portfolio's rate of return at -2.4% and the support portfolio at 2.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised rate of internal return of 12.9% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\nChart 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 shows the investment return rate of the Exchange Fund in 2018 and the average investment return rates for different periods. The average return rate of the Exchange Fund over the past 3 years was 3.2%, over the past 5 years was 2.1%, over the past 10 years was 2.8%, and since 1994 has been 4.7%3. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2018.\n"}

2018年到訪資訊中心的團體類別\n\n# 金管局員工\n\n金管局是政府架構的一部分，但按非公務員條款聘請員工，吸引具適當經驗及專門知識的人才。作為公營機構，金管局不斷精簡工作流程，提高效率及成本效益。金管局致力維持精簡靈活的組織架構，並盡可能透過調配現有人手推行新措施及應付不斷增加的工作量。\n\n金管局是提供平等就業機會的僱主，並確保員工能夠在沒有歧視的環境下工作。金管局的平等機會政策適用於聘用、薪酬與福利、表現評核、晉升、調職╱培訓機會及一般行為操守等方面。\n\n金管局聘用、培訓及維持一支專業優秀的工作團隊，以履行政策目標及靈活應對工作要求的轉變。金管局要求其員工維持高水平的操守及道德標準，不論何時都恪守極高的個人行為及操守規範，並以金管局的最佳利益為依歸。\n\n# 2019年1月1日的主要人力資源數據\n\n# 2018年組織架構變動\n\n外匯基金投資辦公室於8月1日成立，取代過往由儲備管理部與風險管理及監察部負責的投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的成立凸顯金管局的投資職能，提升其機構形象，並能更靈活應對市場的變化，以配合持續擴展及多元化的外匯基金投資工作。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n\n表1 2019年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n負責監察投資風險的員工為外匯基金投資辦公室組織架構的一部分， 在此則歸納於風險管理及監察部以方便呈示其工作職能。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬及浮動薪酬的款項；而適用於負責投資的員工的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁及以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整及浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2018年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。\n2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。金管局高層人員人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁、處置機制辦公室專員及外匯基金投資辦公室首席營運官在內。\n3. 其他福利包括公積金或合約酬金（視情況而定）、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"交出":["performed"],"監管":["supervision","supervisory","regulatory","monitoring","monitor","regulation","regulating","supervise","supervising","supervisor

During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, and strengthening information technology security, to address the challenges posed by implementing new measures and the increasingly heavy workload.\n\n# Stay in contact with the public\n\n# Media Relations and Social Media\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close contact with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2018, the Authority held a total of 96 public media events, including 21 press conferences, 11 on-site interviews, and 64 other public activities. Additionally, 39 media interviews were arranged during the year, and 462 bilingual press releases were issued, with a large number of media inquiries handled daily.\n\nTo enhance the public's understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's principal functions, the Authority holds media briefings and executive workshops for both local and overseas media, covering a variety of topics including the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), fintech development, Green Finance, and infrastructure financing. In addition to enriching the content of its existing YouTube channel and LinkedIn page, the Authority launched an official Facebook page in July, further utilizing social media to strengthen communication with the public.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Governor Norman (left) and the Environment Bureau's mascot \"Big Waste Ghost\" collaborated through social media to promote the use of \"New Welcome Notes\" to seal lucky money envelopes.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe public inquiry service is an effective channel for enhancing the public's understanding of the HKMA's principal functions and operations. In 2018, a total of 9,950 inquiries were handled, of which about half involved banking policies and regulations, consumer banking matters, and banknotes and coins, especially the coin collection program, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and notices, the Faster Payment System \"FPS,\" virtual banking, and the 2018 Hong Kong new series banknotes.\n\nChart 1 shows the total number of public inquiries received each year since 2015, and Chart 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2018.\n\nChart 1: Total Number of Public Inquiries\n\nChart 2: List of Inquiries Received in 2018 by Nature\n\n# Publication\n\nIn addition to the HKMA's Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Currency and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Report in 2018. It also regularly updated the data in the Monthly Financial Data Report, providing the latest and specialized information and analysis on Hong Kong's currency, banking sector, and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA published a total of 13 inSight articles, explaining multiple specialized topics related to its work.\n\n# Financial Services Authority Website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 60,000 pages of information in English and Chinese (traditional and simplified) versions, facilitating public access to the latest updates from the HKMA. The website also features registers maintained under Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, including the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Staff Engaged in Securities Business of Authorized Institutions,\" as well as registers maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, namely the \"Register of Licensees of Stored Value Payment Tools.\" The website includes dedicated topic webpages and prominent quick links to alert the public about new HKMA initiatives, such as \"FPS\" (Faster Payment System), and important timely matters, such as cautioning against telephone scams and the parking locations of cash collection vehicles under the coin collection plan.\n\nTo promote the implementation of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken the lead by launching open APIs on its website starting in July, facilitating public access to key information. The first batch of 50 sets of open API data was successfully rolled out in July, covering areas most frequently accessed by the public, such as statistical data on the banking sector and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and cash collection vehicle schedules. The remaining 80 sets of data will be rolled out in phases before mid-2019. To further facilitate the public's access to the latest news and information about the HKMA on the website, the HKMA is comprehensively revising the website's design and content to make it more user-friendly. The newly designed website is expected to be launched by the end of 2019.\n\nThe HKMA leads by example in promoting the development and application of open APIs.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of the International Financial Centre Phase 2. It introduces the HKMA's work to the public and enhances the public's understanding of monetary and banking affairs. The Information Centre consists of two parts: an exhibition area and a library, which are open to the public for visits and use six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the HKMA's work, as well as the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sectors. It also provides reading materials and exhibits for studying Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe currency section of the Information Centre introduces the design, anti-counterfeiting features, production process, and other fun facts about Hong Kong banknotes and coins. This section underwent renovation works in the first quarter of 2018, incorporating multiple interactive elements, such as games that combine learning with fun, allowing visitors to gain knowledge about Hong Kong currency while also enjoying the experience. Additionally, the currency section has added an artistic Bauhinia tree, assembled from 2,018 transparent cubic blocks made from banknotes that are no longer suitable for circulation and have been shredded, complementing another mosaic artwork within the section made from Hong Kong coins. The currency section with its brand-new design reopened on August 16.\n\nThe Information Centre provides guided tour services for visitors. During the year, the Information Centre received over 59,000 visitors and provided over 580 guided tour services to schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its commencement of full operation in December 2003, the cumulative total number of visitors received by the Information Centre has exceeded 705,000. The library adjacent to the exhibition area houses over 26,000 books, journals, and other publications for researching topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking affairs. The library also maintains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices\" and the \"Register of Staff Engaged in Securities Business by Authorized Institutions\" as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nLaunch interactive games to introduce the process of making Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nThe artistic Bauhinia tree hangs in mid-air, combined with a lighting effect, showcasing the beauty of its form across different seasons.\n\nInformation Centre provides guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nSecondary students and teachers from various districts attended a public education seminar.\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA held a total of three public education seminars in 2018, attracting approximately 1,500 secondary school students and teachers. The topics covered included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking system stability, the Deposit Protection Scheme, the Faster Payment System (FPS), stored value payment tools, FinTech, consumer protection, and financial sector employment information. Since their launch in 1998, the education seminars have attracted nearly 60,000 teachers and students.\n\nChart 3: Types of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2018\n\n# 金管局 staff\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the government framework but hires staff under non-civil service terms to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialised knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA continuously streamlines work processes to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The HKMA is committed to maintaining a streamlined and flexible organisational structure, and endeavours to implement new measures and cope with increasing workloads by optimally allocating existing staff.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is an employer that provides equal employment opportunities and ensures that staff can work in a discrimination-free environment. The Authority's equal opportunity policy applies to appointment, pay and benefits, performance evaluation, promotion, adjustments, training opportunities, and general conduct.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent staff team to fulfill policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work requirements. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority requires its staff to maintain high standards of conduct and ethics, adhering to extremely high personal conduct and ethical standards at all times, and acting in the best interests of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Main Human Resources Data on January 1, 2019\n\n# 2018 Organisation Structure Changes\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office was established on August 1 to replace the investment and related risk management functions previously handled by the Reserve Management Department and the Risk Management and Oversight Department. The establishment of the Exchange Fund Investment Office highlights the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's investment functions, enhances its institutional profile, and enables it to more flexibly respond to market changes, supporting the ongoing expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund's investment activities.\n\nTable 1 lists the position establishment and actual number of staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority by department.\n\nTable 1: Position establishment and actual number of staff members of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as of January 1, 2019\n\nStaff responsible for monitoring investment risks are part of the organisational structure of the Exchange Fund Investment Office. They are grouped under the Risk Management and Oversight Department in this context to facilitate the presentation of their work functions.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Compensation Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary consults the opinions of the governance committees under its jurisdiction through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and refers to market compensation levels and arrangements to decide on the salaries and service conditions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's staff. The salary package includes cash compensation and the provident fund, with additional basic benefits set up. Cash compensation includes a fixed monthly salary (i.e., base salary) and variable pay based on employee performance, disbursed once a year in a lump sum.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff annually, seeking recommendations from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and taking into account the Governance Committee's assessment of the HKMA's performance over the past year, the results of a salary survey for the financial sector conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, as well as other relevant factors. Salaries of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be subject to special adjustments to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates approved funds for adjusting annual fixed and variable salaries based on individual employees' work performance. The variable salary system applicable to employees responsible for investments is aimed at strengthening the link between their investment performance and compensation. Adjustments to fixed salaries and disbursement of variable salaries for employees at or above the level of Assistant Chief Executive are approved by the Financial Secretary after consulting the Governance Committee's opinion, and relevant employees will absent themselves from meetings when their salary proposals are discussed. For employees at or below the level of manager, adjustments to fixed salaries and disbursement of variable salaries are decided by the HKMA Chief Executive based on authorization from the Financial Secretary and in accordance with the approved lump sum allocated for salary payments.\n\n# Senior Officers Compensation\n\nTable 2 sets out the compensation information of senior officers in 2018.\n\n1. Except for accumulated annual leave, the actual salary of employees with less than one year of service is calculated on a pro-rata basis for the full year to determine the average annual salary for the relevant position.  \n2. The number of employees shown in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of senior officers at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority includes the Chairman of the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, the Specialist of the Resolution Mechanism Office, and the Chief Operating Officer of the Exchange Fund Investment Office.  \n3. Other benefits include the pension fund or contractual bonuses (depending on the circumstances), medical and life insurance, as well as accumulated annual leave within the year. These benefits may vary depending on the service conditions of individual senior officers.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019

The responsibilities I must bear in accordance with these guidelines are detailed in the section of this report titled \"Auditor's Responsibilities in the Audit of Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these guidelines, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in line with these guidelines. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is adequate and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Critical Audit Issues\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, based on my professional judgment, are most critical to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters in auditing the overall financial statements and forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the notes to the financial statements 2.5, 2.6, and 40.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group's financial assets accounted for at fair value totaled HK$36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$11,338.29 billion.\n\nThe fair value of 93% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities is the quoted price of the same asset or liability in an active market (Level 1 parameter), or estimated using valuation methods, with the parameters used based on observable market data (Level 2 parameters).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The related financial assets total HK$2,756.31 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nIn view of the sizeable amounts involved and the estimates involved, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are key audit issues.\n\nRegarding the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at fair value, audit procedures include:\n\n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;  \n- Evaluate and test monitoring measures, including application monitoring measures related to computer systems;  \n- Obtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;  \n- If market quotes are used, verify prices based on independent sources;  \n- If the parameters of the valuation method used are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is suitable and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters based on independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters of the valuation method used are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation method is suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value\n\nApply to the financial statements notes 2.12, 20 and 21.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, amounting to HK$25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also holds interests in 3 associate companies and 20 joint ventures, the principal business of which is to hold overseas investment properties, with those interests amounting to HK$44.336 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or through associate or joint venture companies, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined by the valuations of independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for valuing investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports of investment properties held directly by the Group or by associate companies or joint ventures, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the valuation experts; and  \n- Evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the relevant assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other data. Other data includes all the information in the Monetary Authority's 2018 annual report, but does not include financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other data, and I also do not issue any form of attestation conclusions regarding other data.\n\nWith respect to the audit of financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information and thereby consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or the circumstances I became aware of during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe the other information contains material misstatements, I need to report this fact. In this regard, I have no reports.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the Monetary Authority regarding the financial statements.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing the internal controls that it considers necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and in applicable circumstances, disclosing matters related to continuing as a going concern, and using the going concern as the accounting basis.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The auditor's responsibility in the audit of financial statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the overall financial statements do not contain any material misstatements caused by fraud or error, and to publish an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. A misstatement may be caused by fraud or error. If it is reasonably expected that they individually or in aggregate may affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements, they will be considered material misstatements.\n\nIn the process of conducting an audit according to the Audit Office's audit standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a rigorous skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or override of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error;\n- Understand internal controls related to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Monetary Authority's practice of using the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and that are related to events or circumstances. If I consider that such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained as of the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for guiding, supervising, and executing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope and time of the plan, as well as significant audit findings and other matters, including any significant deficiencies in internal control identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to possibly affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures in applicable situations.\n\nFrom matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most critical to the audit of the current period's financial statements, thereby constituting key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws and regulations prohibit the public disclosure of a particular matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where I decide not to communicate the matter in the report because the negative consequences of communicating it in my report are expected to outweigh the public interest generated by it.\n\nDirector of the Audit Office Zhu Nai Zhang\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
