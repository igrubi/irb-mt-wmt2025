{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

\"black swan\" events. Although the UK's Brexit referendum and the outcome of the US presidential election rendered various polls a laughing stock, more surprisingly was the reaction of financial markets. Taking the US election as an example, news of Trump's election led to an immediate plunge in the three major US stock indices' futures before market opening. However, shortly after the market opened, the US stock indices quickly rebounded, thereafter trending upward and repeatedly setting new highs. This series of events highlighted the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market capabilities, also marking a milestone in the major uncertainties of future global developments.\n\nOver the past year, multiple key financial data points have reflected exceptionally sensitive market sentiment: the yield on US 10-year Treasury bonds fell to a historical low of 1.36 basis points in July, then surged to 2.6 basis points by mid-December following the US presidential election. The US Dollar Index, which reflects the movement of the US dollar against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high by year-end; New York crude oil futures prices rebounded from a year-start low of $26 per barrel to $54 by year-end. In Hong Kong's stock market, the Hang Seng Index mildly rose by 86 points for the year, although the peak-to-trough difference during the period exceeded 6,000 points. With turbulent external conditions, the importance and value of financial system stability, particularly in the monetary and banking systems, have become even more evident.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors that international hedge funds were plotting to target the renminbi and Hong Kong dollar were rampant, causing public anxiety. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority promptly disseminated clear and resolute messages to the market, emphasizing that we have absolute confidence and capability to defend the linked exchange rate system and ensure the stability of Hong Kong's financial system, timely stabilizing market confidence. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained closely aligned with the strong-side exchange rate guarantee for an extended period. Due to ample liquidity in the banking system, even though the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2016 and March 2017, there was no immediate significant impact on the Hong Kong dollar's interest rates or exchange rates.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system has continued to develop steadily. Overall loans recorded a modest growth of 6.5% last year, with asset quality remaining good and the non-performing loan ratio maintained at a healthy level of 0.85%, well below the long-term average of about 2% since 2000. The banking system's capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio have both remained at high levels above statutory requirements. In the residential mortgage business, after seven rounds of counter-cyclical measures, the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly granted residential property mortgages declined from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing the necessary buffer should the property market cycle reverse and impact the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor the development of the property market and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain banking system stability.\n\nLegislative efforts to further strengthen the stability of the banking system made encouraging progress last year. Two pieces of legislation, aimed at optimizing the deposit protection scheme and addressing the risks associated with the \"too big to fail\" nature of financial institutions, were smoothly passed in a timely manner before the previous Legislative Council term ended. The former accelerates the payout of deposit protection funds and simplifies the payout process, helping to enhance depositors' confidence in the banking system; the latter establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks arising from their failure and to minimize the need to use public funds to bail them out. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a Resolution Mechanism Office since April 1, 2023, to implement the requirements of the legislation and oversee follow-up work.\n\nThe banking sector is known as the \"mother of all industries\" and serves as a vital channel for savings, payments, and credit for the real economy and the general public's daily lives. During the year, some representatives from the SME sector reported difficulties in financing. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) immediately communicated with the banking sector, hoping that banks would continue to provide funding support to SMEs' operations and development while maintaining prudent risk management. We also strengthened the promotion of the government's \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" to the business community through our subsidiary, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, and maintained close communication with the banking sector to alleviate concerns, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for bad debts, thereby increasing banks' willingness to participate in the program. Through these multi-pronged measures, certain results have been achieved. According to a survey conducted by the HKMA, the overall credit facilities for SMEs remained stable last year, with credit limits maintained or even increased for over 90% of companies. Meanwhile, the number of applications for the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" also rose significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services have become an essential component of business operations and daily life. Last year, after learning that some overseas companies and startups encountered difficulties in opening accounts in Hong Kong, we immediately initiated follow-up efforts, contacting multiple international chambers of commerce and industry associations, and engaging in in-depth communication with the banking sector to implement targeted measures. In September last year, I issued a notice to all Hong Kong banks, explaining how to understand the HKMA's \"risk-based\" regulatory principles concerning anti-money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, and how to apply these principles to account opening applications and due diligence measures for existing customers. I emphasized that banks should not adopt a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach for all customers. After consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding company account openings has improved, but there is still room for further progress, which remains one of our key priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The HKMA has consistently encouraged banks, while pursuing commercial profits, to also take into account the public's basic banking service needs. As fintech advances rapidly, the channels through which banks provide services are also becoming more diversified. In addition to the increasingly popular online banking services, several banks launched mobile banking units or video teller machine services last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. Under our promotion, several banks have also planned to establish physical branches in remote areas to enhance services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial centre is like rowing upstream, and therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been continuously seeking new opportunities for the development of Hong Kong's financial industry and exploring new areas over the years. 2016 was a fruitful year, with fintech and infrastructure financing standing out as highlights.\n\nIn the field of fintech, Hong Kong's retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued 13 stored value payment facilities licenses, creating a conducive business environment for retail payment services through licensing and a regulatory regime, accompanied by a series of public education campaigns, ensuring that consumers enjoy the convenience brought by new technology while their rights are properly protected.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March last year to promote the development of fintech related to the banking sector. Within a few months, we launched several new initiatives, including the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative,\" establishing a new three-pronged platform for risk assessment, information sharing, and talent training to strengthen the cybersecurity of the banking system. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct specialized research on distributed ledger technology, exploring the feasibility of its application in Hong Kong's banking sector, and established the Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to the banking sector and fintech industry. The HKMA's banking supervisory department also set up the \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,\" allowing banks to test new technologies in a smaller and controlled environment, accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks have tested 14 new technology projects using the sandbox, with some projects already launched in the market, bringing more fintech products to the public.\n\nThe global demand for infrastructure financing is substantial, especially since the proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative, making infrastructure financing a focal topic of interest both domestically and internationally. As Asia's international financial center, Hong Kong holds significant advantages in the field of infrastructure financing. In July last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, abbreviated as IFFO), creating a new and unique platform to bring together over 60 world-class multilateral institutions, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, as well as developers and operators of infrastructure projects and various professional institutions, to exchange information, share experiences, and seek cooperation opportunities regarding infrastructure investment and financing. Since its establishment, IFFO has organized more than ten large-scale conferences, seminars, and workshops. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although its operational period is relatively short, it has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's future role as a center for infrastructure investment and financing.\n\nBreaking down barriers is the surest way to enhance competitiveness. This year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has actively participated in and supported the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in amending the Inland Revenue Ordinance, providing a favorable tax environment for enterprises operating internal treasury business within the group in Hong Kong. We have also actively engaged with multinational corporations, attracting them to develop or expand their corporate treasury activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong's financial market.\n\nLast year's offshore RMB market was in an adjustment period. Affected by factors such as market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the scale of global offshore RMB funding pools generally contracted. Despite this, Hong Kong still maintains a leading position in offshore RMB business, sustaining the world's largest RMB funding pool, with RMB settled through Hong Kong remaining at a daily average high of approximately RMB86 billion. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong's offshore RMB market, in October last year we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from 7 to 9, raising the total quota for bilateral liquidity funding from RMB14 billion to RMB18 billion, ensuring that even in the event of tightening in the offshore RMB market, the market can maintain orderly operations. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect in December last year further boosted Hong Kong's RMB business. The HKMA is also working with relevant mainland authorities to study the Bond Connect framework, further facilitating participation of investors from both sides in the bond market and optimizing the linkage of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite the global investment environment being fraught with various unstable factors last year, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of 681 billion Hong Kong dollars, thanks to the multiple defensive measures taken over the past period. Since 1994, the Foreign Exchange Fund's compound annual investment return rate has reached 4.8%, higher than the 2.1% local inflation rate during the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including further expanding asset categories and increasing allocations to credit assets, inflation-protected investment products, and emerging markets. As the flagship of diversified investments, the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" invests in alternative assets through private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has maintained strong performance, achieving an average annualised internal rate of return of approximately 12% since establishment. With the government's \"Future Fund\" partially allocated to this portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. As of the end of last year, the asset size of the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" amounted to approximately HK$181.8 billion, with a total amount of approximately HK$133.8 billion approved but not yet drawn down for investment. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of \"capital preservation first, long-term value growth,\" seeking long-term stable returns while maintaining ample liquidity and contingency funds.\n"}

Hong Kong's economic growth has softened. Hong Kong's stock market and residential property market have experienced volatility this year, and housing affordability remains stretched.\n\nDespite the increase in global market risks and shocks, Hong Kong's banking system remains sound. Bank capital and liquidity conditions remain good; asset quality shows slight signs of deterioration, but remains at healthy levels.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite facing a volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable, reflecting the resilience of the linked exchange rate system to withstand external shocks.\n\nMoney markets continue to operate smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. In December, following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the Federal Funds Rate target range, Hong Kong's basic interest rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.00%.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority strengthens the regulatory risk governance framework, as well as the management of credit, liquidity, and technology risks. The HKMA also takes specific actions to promote financial inclusion and address the difficulties companies encounter when opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, significant progress has been made in Hong Kong's preparations for implementing international regulatory and accounting standards, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# Hong Kong's International Financial Centre Status\n\nHong Kong maintains its position as the global offshore Renminbi business hub and asset management centre. The tax system has been further refined to foster a more favorable environment, attracting multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office. The HKMA smoothly commenced the implementation of the regulatory regime for stored value payment tools and retail payment systems, and granted 13 stored value payment tools licences.\n\n# Reserve Management\n\nDespite the difficult investment environment, which was full of black swan events, thanks to a series of defensive measures taken over the past few years that enhanced the foreign exchange fund's resilience, the fund recorded a 2% overall investment return.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority quickens the pace of diversification of investment, especially in long-term growth portfolios.\n\n# Institutional Functions\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority communicates effectively with the community and market through media, public education activities, and other various channels, facilitating the public's understanding of the Authority's policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to strengthen institutional governance, including supporting staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strict financial control, and enhanced IT security measures, to help cope with the challenges brought about by implementing new measures and increasingly complex tasks.\n"}

The user provided the Chinese text \"# 11月8日\" and wants it translated into English. First, I need to break down the components.\nThe \"#\" symbol is straightforward—it's just a hashtag or pound sign. The date is \"11月8日\". In the dictionary, \"月\" can be translated as \"November\" (since 11月 is November) and \"日\" can be \"8\" or \"eight\". But looking at the dictionary entries for \"日\", there's an entry \"8 November\" which is a specific date. Wait, but the original is 11月8日, which is November 8th. However, in the dictionary, under \"日\", there's \"8 November\" listed. But that would be the 8th of November, which is the same as November 8th. However, the user's input is 11月8日, which is November 8th. But the dictionary entry for \"日\" includes \"8 November\" as a possible translation. However, the standard way to write dates in English is month first, then day, so November 8th. But the dictionary might have specific entries. Let me check again.\nThe dictionary for \"月\" includes \"November\" as an option for 11月. For \"日\", the entry includes \"8\" and \"eight\", but also \"8 November\" as a specific date. However, the original text is \"11月8日\", which is 11th month (November) and 8th day. So the correct translation would be \"November 8th\" or \"8 November\". But the dictionary has \"8 November\" as a possible translation for \"日\". Wait, but \"日\" here is the day part. The user's input is \"11月8日\", which is November 8th. The dictionary entry for \"日\" includes \"8 November\" as a possible translation. However, that's the same as November 8th. But in English, both formats are acceptable, though \"November 8th\" is more common in American English, while \"8 November\" is more common in British English. However, the user's dictionary might have specific entries. Let me check the dictionary again.\nLooking at the dictionary, under \"日\", there's \"8 November\" listed. So if the original is \"11月8日\", translating \"11月\" as \"November\" (from the \"月\" dictionary entry) and \"8日\" as \"8 November\" (from the \"日\" entry). Wait, but that would be \"November 8 November\", which doesn't make sense. That can't be right. There's a mistake here. The \"日\" in \"8日\" is the day, so \"8日\" should be translated as \"8th\" or \"8\". But the dictionary entry for \"日\" includes \"8\" and \"eight\", but also specific dates like \"8 November\". However, the original is \"11月8日\", which is November 8th. The dictionary entry for \"日\" has \"8 November\" as a possible translation, but that's the entire date. However, the original is structured as month and day, so \"11月\" is November, and \"8日\" is the 8th day. Therefore, the correct translation should be \"November 8th\" or \"8 November\". But the dictionary might have specific entries. Let me check again.\nThe user's dictionary for \"月\" includes \"November\" as an option for 11月. For \"日\", the entry includes \"8\" and \"eight\", but also \"8 November\" as a specific date. However, the original text is \"11月8日\", which is November 8th. If the dictionary has \"8 November\" as a possible translation for \"日\", then combining \"11月\" (November) with \"8日\" (8 November) would be redundant. That suggests that maybe the dictionary entry for \"日\" includes \"8\" as a possible translation. So \"11月8日\" would be \"November 8\". Alternatively, if the user's dictionary has \"8 November\" as a specific date, but the original is structured as month and day, then the correct translation would be \"November 8th\". However, the user's dictionary might have specific mappings. Let me check the dictionary again.\nThe dictionary for \"日\" includes \"8 November\" as one of the options. But that's a full date. However, the original text is \"11月8日\", which is the 8th day of November. So the correct translation would be \"November 8th\" or \"8 November\". Since the user's dictionary includes \"8 November\" as a possible translation for \"日\", but that's the entire date. However, the original is structured as month and day, so \"11月\" is November, and \"8日\" is the 8th. Therefore, the correct translation would be \"November 8th\" or \"8 November\".

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖

本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖

物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7

盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising in","leveraging

growth softened in 2016. Faced with intensified uncertainties in the external environment, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real local GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with weakness in the tourism sector weighing down services exports (Figure 1). Local demand momentum also slowed, but continued to provide the main support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained largely stable, with the unemployment rate maintained at a low level of 3.3 to 3.4%. Due to the easing of local cost pressures and external price pressures, consumer price inflation further slowed. Faced with a volatile external environment and changing market sentiment, asset markets added volatility. In light of the revival of the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite the volatility in the external environment and the rise in US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and currency markets continue to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate, after slightly weakening in January, has continued to hover around the 7.75 level. The exchange guarantee was not triggered during the year, and the total surplus combined with outstanding foreign exchange fund bills and bonds remained almost unchanged, amounting to approximately 1.2 trillion Hong Kong dollars. Following the US interest rate hike in mid-December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised its basic interest rate from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels, but slightly increased as the year approached its end, partly reflecting the trends in corresponding US dollar interbank rates and yields. Overall bank loan growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although overall loan quality slightly deteriorated, the specific classified loan ratios remained at extremely low levels.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1: Real Domestic GDP Growth by Expenditure Items (Compared to the Previous Period)\n\nNote: The quarterly changes in the adjusted total amount of local fixed capital formation are not available.  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n#LocalDemand\n\nThe growth momentum of local demand slightly weakened in 2016. Despite stable employment and income conditions continuing to support private consumption, its growth rate still fell to 1.6%, partly reflecting intensified economic uncertainties. Government consumption growth also slightly slowed to 3.3%. The total fixed capital formation in the local economy continued to fluctuate markedly on a quarterly basis (Chart 2), with a cumulative annual contraction of 0.5%. Machinery and equipment purchases by the private sector became the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year under a poor business outlook, while building and construction activities turned more positive due to an increase in housing construction projects.\n\nFigure 2 Local Demand Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# External Demand\n\nHong Kong exports showed signs of stabilizing near the end of 2016, but the performance for the whole year remained weak (Figure 3). Goods exports rose 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Hong Kong's exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, under more stable regional trade flows, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015.\n\nPartly reflecting the normalization of retail sales after a period of rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong's exports of services contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Goods imports, which had contracted in 2015, regained some ground in 2016, while imports of services continued to grow, partially benefiting from the desire of local residents to travel abroad. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, dragging down local economic growth.\n\nFigure 3 Exports of Goods and Exports of Services  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflation pressures remained controlled in 2016. After excluding the impact of the government's one-time relief measures, the core inflation rate fell from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Chart 4). Under the translation effect from earlier newly introduced private residential rent reductions, the inflation component of rent in the Composite Consumer Price Index declined. Benefiting from softer global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar, import price inflation was curbed. On the other hand, local cost pressures remained moderate, as the stable growth in labor costs and rent cost pressures (particularly in the retail sector) eased.\n\nFigure 4 Basic Consumer Price Inflation Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# labour market\n\nThe labour market remained largely stable in 2016, with similar increases in labour supply and demand. By industry analysis, the labour market conditions in tourism-related industries deteriorated, while other industries remained largely stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Chart 5). Under the stable labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared to an increase of 4.6% in 2015. Real wages also increased by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared to an increase of 1.5% in 2015.\n\nFigure 5 Labour Market Conditions  \nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant fluctuations in 2016. Affected by the pressure from the depreciation of the renminbi and the volatility in the mainland stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). The Hong Kong stock market rebounded in March, following the significant recovery in the US and other major stock markets. Despite the UK's Brexit referendum triggering market volatility, market sentiment quickly improved under external expectations that the US Federal Reserve would slow its rate hikes and other major central banks implementing monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, the Hong Kong stock market faced renewed pressure in the fourth quarter, influenced by the outcome of the US presidential election and expectations that the US would accelerate its rate hikes. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. The average daily turnover fell from 105.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the previous year to 66.9 billion Hong Kong dollars, while the total fundraising amount in the Hong Kong stock market also decreased from 1,115.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the previous year to 490.1 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nFigure 6: Asset Prices  \nSource: Rates and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Trading and Settlement Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight volatility in 2016. After recording a historical low in the first quarter, property turnover recovered somewhat in the subsequent months, but fell again following the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, turnover in 2016 slightly declined to 54,701 transactions. On the other hand, property prices rose since the second quarter and surpassed the peak recorded in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% in 2016 (Chart 6). Housing affordability remains tight, with the price-to-income ratio at 15.9, exceeding the historical high in 1997; the income leverage ratio was 72.0%, far above the long-term average. 2 Due to banks introducing competitive mortgage schemes, mortgage rates slightly declined, but slightly recovered as they approached the end of the year, following the rise in Hong Kong interbank offered rates. In the commercial property market, year-round trading volume remained largely stable. Due to non-residential property prices falling from the 2015 peak, corresponding rental yields slightly increased compared to the previous year, but remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Prospects\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nThe real local GDP growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017. The government forecasts economic growth to range between 2% and 3%, while private sector analysts predict an average increase of 2.0%. Externally, as the global macroeconomic and financial environment becomes more uncertain, global economic and trade growth is likely to remain moderate. Additionally, the rise in the Hong Kong dollar's real effective exchange rate, driven by the strength of the US dollar, is expected to dampen Hong Kong's export performance. Locally, although stable employment and income conditions are expected to support consumption, private consumption is anticipated to grow only moderately due to the drag from rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of several infrastructure projects, building and construction activities should grow steadily. However, a weak business climate and rising interest rates are likely to affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and Labour Market\n\nInflationary pressure is expected to remain moderate in 2017. On one hand, rising global commodity prices and increasing inflation in China could lead to higher import prices, while on the other hand, a stronger HK dollar may suppress these pressures. Under moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures are expected to remain controlled, but due to the rise in new residential rental prices in early 2017, inflation in the rent component of the Composite Consumer Price Index may rise slightly. The market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.0%. Although increased uncertainty may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertainty Factors and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be constrained by numerous uncertainties, with the impact from the external environment being particularly significant. The uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new US government will make the global economic outlook more uncertain, and potential protectionist policies may also pose resistance to global trade. The Brexit process and the upcoming elections in several major European countries may also lead to asset market volatility and affect the flow of Hong Kong dollar funds. Additionally, the normalization of US interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the property market remains particularly tight, and market prospects remain highly uncertain. In the short term, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and the introduction of additional incentives by property developers (such as discounts and cash rebates) have released accumulated purchasing power, providing support for residential demand. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, the potential acceleration of US interest rate hikes, and the steady growth in housing supply may continue to pose resistance to the property market.\n\n# Banking system performance\n\nDespite Hong Kong's economy facing resistance, coupled with unexpected outcomes from international political events intensifying market volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained sound in 2016. Authorised institutions maintained good capital and liquidity conditions, with asset quality showing slight deterioration, but still remained at healthy levels.\n\n# Interest Rate Trends\n\nWith the rise in US interest rates, Hong Kong banks' interbank interest rates rose significantly in November and December. The composite interest rate reflecting retail banks' Hong Kong dollar funding costs increased slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Hong Kong Banks' Interbank Interest Rates, Comprehensive Interest Rates, and Most Favorable Loan Interest Rates\n\nNote:  \n1. The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (monthly average) are announced by the Hong Kong Banking Association.  \n2. The most favorable loan rate (monthly average) is based on the rate reported by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nRetail banking's profits slightly improved in 2016, with its Hong Kong business's overall pre-tax operating profit growing by 8.7%. The growth was mainly driven by foreign exchange and derivatives business income (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiary companies (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), although part of the growth was offset by a decrease in expenses and commission income (-11.3%). Retail banking's post-tax profit recorded a 44.4% increase, with the growth primarily coming from non-recurring items. Retail banking's post-tax average return on assets also rose correspondingly from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8: Performance of Retail Banking\n\nIn 2016, the net interest margin of retail banks was 1.32%, the same as the level in 2015 (Chart 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate their remaining funds to financial investments with lower interest rates but higher liquidity, the decrease in interest income was offset by the decline in interest costs.\n\nChart 9 Retail Bank Net Interest Difference\n\nRetail banks' non-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, remaining largely stable. Although fee and commission income fell by 11.3%, dividend income and foreign exchange and derivatives business income rose by 123.5% and 39.7% respectively.\n"}

貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5

研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate maintained stability in 2016. Hong Kong's monetary market also continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity in the interbank sector. The linked exchange rate system continued to demonstrate a high capacity to withstand shocks, serving as the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# target\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, i.e., to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts the monetary issuance system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100% support to the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also make corresponding adjustments, fully aligning with the changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary Base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Liability certificates (providing full support for banknotes issued by three issuing banks)  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins  \n- The total balance of settlement accounts held by banks at the HKMA (i.e., total balance)  \n- Foreign exchange fund bills and notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. If market demand for Hong Kong dollars exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing total reserves and causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall, thereby returning the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to the exchange rate range of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if Hong Kong dollars are in excess supply, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange guarantee rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing total reserves and raising the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, thereby returning the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to the exchange rate range.\n\n# 2016 Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained within a narrow range for the rest of 2016 after experiencing slight fluctuations in the first two months of the year. Early in 2016, the Hong Kong dollar significantly weakened against the US dollar, falling from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Figure 1). This weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate aligned with the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve's December 2015 interest rate hike. Additionally, other market-related factors, including the sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, declining optimism regarding the economic outlooks of both mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate, and the general weakness of Asian currencies, all contributed to a decline in demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improved market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened in February and remained within a narrow range between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onward, remaining unaffected even by market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nChart 1 2016 Market Exchange Rate\n\nAs the convertibility guarantee was not triggered, the total surplus and the aggregate outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund bills and notes remained largely unchanged in 2016, staying around 122.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued additional foreign exchange fund bills and notes totaling 13.2 billion Hong Kong dollars to meet the substantial liquidity management demands of banks, causing the total surplus to correspondingly decline to 25.96 billion Hong Kong dollars by the end of 2016. The issuance of additional foreign exchange fund bills and notes conforms to the principles of the currency board system, as such issuance merely represents a transfer within components of the monetary base—from the total surplus to the outstanding foreign exchange fund bills and notes—while the monetary base continues to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2 2016 Aggregate Balance and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills & Notes\n\n# Money Market\n\nHIBOR remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Chart 3). During January and February, HIBOR faced some upward pressure due to increased volatility in financial markets, but turned more stable in March as the financial environment calmed down. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns over the outcome of the UK Brexit referendum and US money market fund reforms, HIBOR remained largely stable. Partly due to year-end funding demands and HIBOR catching up with the rise in US dollar rates, HIBOR recorded a significant increase in the fourth quarter. Despite this, short-term interbank rates remained below the base rate level throughout 2016.\n\nIn response to the US Federal Funds Rate target range being raised from 0.25 to 0.50厘 to 0.50 to 0.75厘 on December 14 (US time), the basic interest rate was raised from 0.75厘 to 1.00厘 on December 15. The adjustment of the basic interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of the lower bound of the US Federal Funds Rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average level of the 5-day moving average of the overnight and 1-month Hong Kong interbank interest rates, whichever is higher.\n\nChart 3 2016 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points experienced a marked premium in January, largely following the trends of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, as well as partly reflecting investors' demand for foreign exchange hedging for their Hong Kong stock portfolios (Figure 4). The forward exchange rate premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions turned more stable, Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points remained largely stable during the period from March to November, and then rose again in December due to the narrowing of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HK$5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the linked exchange rate system (Linked Exchange Rate System) has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past several decades. In early 2016, intensified market volatility once again sparked comments about the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and a situation similar to the Asian financial crisis period. To enhance understanding of the Linked Exchange Rate System among various sectors, the HKMA explained the technical details of the system to the public and pointed out that Hong Kong's financial system has the capacity to withstand shocks. The government also reaffirmed its firm commitment to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. Stability in foreign exchange and currency markets further solidified public confidence in the government's resolve to maintain the Linked Exchange Rate System and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and preservation of value. During its annual Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) clearly stated that the Linked Exchange Rate System is the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, noting that Hong Kong's flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and sound and effective financial regulation serve as the backing for the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nChart 4 2016 US$ against HK$ Forward Exchange Rate Points\n\nIn the light of the critical role of a sound banking system in the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, the HKMA continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and strengthens oversight of banks' personal, corporate, and mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system has the capacity to address shocks. Facing the normalization of US monetary policy, Hong Kong's interbank interest rates have begun to rise. The HKMA reminds the public to stay vigilant and be well-prepared to cope with potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund's assets have been designated to support the currency base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets relative to the currency base) fluctuated within a narrow range between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without reaching the upper or lower limits. The ratio was 106.7% on December 31, 2016 (Chart 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial fiscal resources can provide strong support for Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Change in 2016 Support Ratio\n\n# Research Work\n\nThe Currency Board, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining subjects related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2016, the topics discussed by the Currency Board included the synchronization of Hong Kong's economic growth with that of mainland China and the US, external demand for Hong Kong dollars, and Hong Kong's financial conditions index. The minutes of the Currency Board meetings and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's reports on the operation of the Currency Board system are both available on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Financial Research Centre continues to support research in monetary policy, the banking sector, and the financial sector. In 2016, the research centre invited a total of 18 scholars to visit and published 20 working papers.\n\nWithin the year, the Research Centre organised six international conferences and seminars, mainly including:\n- In January, hosted the 7th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, with the theme \"China's growing influence on the global economy.\" During the conference, eight research papers covering a wide range of topics were presented, including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the RMB on the global and regional economies, and the trends in interest rate differentials and information flows between RMB markets.\n- In March, co-hosted with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University the \"HKUST, Keio University, and Research Centre Conference on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics.\" The content covered multiple economic issues, including global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- In August, co-hosted with Hong Kong City University the \"Real Estate and Financial Stability Seminar.\" Papers presented at the seminar covered topics such as age, demographics, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamics of Hong Kong housing prices; housing market affordability; the impact of mortgage regulations on housing decisions across the family life cycle; and the residential property market in mainland China.\n- In October, co-hosted with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements a conference on the Asia-Pacific economic system, with the theme \"The resilience of the regional economic system in the face of a turbulent global environment.\" The conference attracted senior officials from multiple central banks, leading scholars, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who engaged in interactive roundtable discussions to exchange views on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system. The topics discussed were broad, including financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, the spillover effects of the slowdown in mainland China's economy on other regions, and the impact on and prospects for Asia's potential growth.\n\nThe Centre also hosted the \"14th Annual Summer Seminar\" in August and the \"14th China Mainland Economic Seminar\" in September, discussing asset quality and financial stability matters of Mainland China's banking sector. The aforementioned meetings and seminars attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and representatives from central banks around the world. The Centre also hosted 21 open small seminars within the year, discussing a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial issues.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (referring to banknotes issued by issuing banks) amounted to 407.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, an increase of 13.2% compared to the previous year (Charts 6, 7, and 8). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the Government was 11.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year (Charts 9 and 10). Among the banknotes and coins issued by the Government, the total value of circulating 10 Hong Kong dollar banknotes was 4.4 billion Hong Kong dollars, of which polymer banknotes accounted for 86%.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

system remained sound in 2016. The HKMA strengthened its supervision of the risk governance frameworks of authorized institutions, as well as the effectiveness of their credit and liquidity risk management systems. In light of the increasing frequency of cyber attacks, the HKMA also enhanced its oversight of the technology risk management practices of authorized institutions. To implement the HKMA's commitment to combating financial crimes, the effectiveness of authorized institutions' measures to monitor money laundering and terrorist financing remains a key regulatory focus for the HKMA. In regulating the conduct of authorized institutions, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote customer-centric corporate culture and advance financial inclusion, as well as address difficulties faced by overseas small and medium-sized enterprises and startups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its supervision of the practices used by authorized institutions in selling investment and insurance products to further enhance customer protection.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, the HKMA has made significant progress in preparing Hong Kong for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards; this includes stabilising the net funding ratio, setting limits on large risk exposures, International Financial Reporting Standard 9, and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Review\n\n# Regulatory Work Overview\n\nIn 2016, the HKMA conducted 188 non-site reviews, covering a wide range, including CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its contact with the boards of directors of authorized institutions to enhance risk governance and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with the board of directors or its committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors (IneDs) to exchange opinions on corporate culture and risk governance matters. The HKMA also held trilateral joint meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the remuneration systems of authorized institutions help promote effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy levels, the HKMA reviews the capital plans of authorised institutions, including their capital targets for the next few years, to be well-prepared for the full implementation of Basel III buffer capital in 2019. Stress tests on the capital adequacy of authorised institutions have also been improved in response to the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also prudently assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides feedback on areas needing improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA continues to complement regular on-site inspections with thematic assessments, which are primarily applied to higher-risk areas. This regulatory approach enables the HKMA to more effectively allocate regulatory resources to address the various new and key risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic assessments. The focus of these reviews and assessments remains on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly credit risks related to mainland China operations; another key focus is measures to combat money laundering and the monitoring of terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the frequency of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity risk, operational risk, and technology risk management. During the year, specialist review teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' businesses related to securities, investment products, insurance, and the mandatory provident fund (MPF).\n\nTable 1 contains an overview of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory work in 2016.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nBank loans grew modestly in 2016. The total outstanding loans increased by 6.5% for the year; the growth rate in 2015 was 3.5% (Table 2). Due to the growth rate of customer deposits exceeding that of bank loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of related loans in Mainland China increased by 7% to 35,640 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2016 (Table 3), which includes 5,450 billion Hong Kong dollars in loans recorded by subsidiaries established in the Mainland by banks registered in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained sound in 2016. Despite the specific classification loan ratio for retail banks rising slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained well below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the specific classification loan ratio for the overall banking sector rose from 0.73% to 0.85%. During the year, the asset quality of domestic-related loans in the banking sector showed a similar trend; during the same period, the specific classification loan ratio for these loans in retail banks rose slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, while the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also rose slightly from 0.77% a year earlier to 0.80%.\n\nThe HKMA devotes significant regulatory resources to ensure that authorised institutions continue to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. The HKMA also pays special attention to the sustained increase in risk exposure of authorised institutions towards mainland China's private enterprises, as well as the credit risk arising from investments in debt securities aimed at increasing returns. In addition, the HKMA conducts thematic assessments on the credit risk management of authorised institutions in relation to the distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loans\n\nThe HKMA continues to closely monitor the property loan business of authorized institutions. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015, but rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% for the year. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly granted residential mortgage loans fell from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA introduced its first round of countercyclical property loan measures, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio for newly granted residential mortgage loans also declined from 41% in August 2010, when the HKMA first introduced a cap on debt-to-income ratios, to 34% in December 2016 (Chart 1).\n\nChart 1: Average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and repayment-to-income ratio for newly granted residential property mortgage loans  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced a cap on repayment-to-income ratio before launching the first round of counter-cyclical property loan measures.\n\nAccording to the seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in February 2015, authorized institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements must extend the application of the 15% lower bound for credit risk-weighted amounts from newly granted mortgage loans to the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This provision took effect in June 2016.\n\nMore property developers are directly providing mortgage loans to property buyers within the year, with their loan-to-value (LTV) ratios often exceeding the levels permitted under the HKMA's prudential requirements for authorized institutions. The HKMA is closely monitoring this development and regularly communicates with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage the risk exposure related to property developers. Additionally, the Land Registry, at the request of the HKMA, has agreed to provide an electronic alert service to authorized institutions. Authorized institutions using this service will receive electronic alert messages from the Land Registry when other mortgage documents related to properties they have taken security over are submitted to the Land Registry for registration. This service will help address situations where mortgage borrowers take out additional mortgage loans on the same property without prior approval from the authorized institution taking security. The Land Registry launched the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Supervision of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nLike other international financial centres, Hong Kong faces increasingly growing cyber threats. In 2016, the HKMA received reports from authorised institutions about cases involving unauthorised stock trading and attempts to infiltrate their payment systems, and immediately took action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued electronic banking service tips, reminding the public to be cautious of online stock trading scams and recommending that the public take preventive measures. The HKMA also issued notices to authorised institutions, providing guidance on security measures that could be taken to further strengthen the monitoring of online banking services. Regarding cases of attempts to infiltrate banking payment systems, the HKMA had already alerted authorised institutions to be vigilant about such scams when the first related case was identified in Hong Kong, and with the assistance of the police, explained the modus operandi of such scams, as well as required authorised institutions to take into account these methods when enhancing monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the banking system's capacity to cope with cybersecurity risks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Cybersecurity Defense Plan in May 2016. This plan comprises three pillars: the Cybersecurity Defense Assessment Framework, a professional training program, and a cybersecurity risk information sharing platform (see the section on the \"Fintech Facilitation Office\" in the chapter titled \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\"). In December, the HKMA issued a notice to authorized institutions outlining the implementation timeline for the Cybersecurity Defense Assessment Framework.\n\nThe application of fintech in the banking sector made significant progress in 2016, with multiple authorized institutions launching new fintech products. Notably, developments in person-to-person small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication stood out. In September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox,\" allowing authorized institutions to conduct pilot trials of their fintech projects in a controlled environment without needing to fully comply with HKMA's regulatory requirements. This arrangement enables authorized institutions to collect real data and user feedback early on before officially launching their fintech services, facilitating appropriate modifications. As of the end of 2016, six applications for using the fintech regulatory sandbox were approved, involving new fintech products related to biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain technology for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also increased the transaction limit for online banking person-to-person small-value payment services without requiring dual authentication to HK$5,000 per account daily, to meet the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, multiple fraud cases related to property occurred, involving fraudsters impersonating property owners attempting to gain benefits by applying for mortgage loans or selling the relevant properties. Although these fraud cases did not involve authorized institutions, the HKMA still closely cooperated with the police and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association) to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing these fraud cases within the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the \"Operations Incident Communications,\" sharing lessons learned from operational incidents that occurred at authorized institutions with the industry. The HKMA also conducted on-site reviews and thematic assessments of authorized institutions' business operational risk management systems, fraud management methods, trust\/custody business operations, and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent non-compliant or unauthorized transaction activities.\n\n# Regulatory Oversight of Treasury Business and Liquidity Risk\n\nIn 2016, several major political events occurred, leading to multiple marked fluctuations in financial markets throughout the year. Meanwhile, US interest rates continued to slowly normalize, and the Federal Open Market Committee decided in December to raise the Federal Funds Rate, marking the second time since the global financial crisis. To be well-prepared to cope with these political events, the HKMA continues to maintain close contact with overseas regulatory authorities, assesses the impact of these events on the Hong Kong banking system, and requires banks to stay vigilant and strengthen their risk management to address adverse market developments.\n\nIn liquidity risk management, the HKMA conducted additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system's ability to cope with severe stress scenarios and carried out follow-up actions on authorized institutions to strengthen their capacity to respond. Following a round of on-site reviews in 2015 aimed at interest rate risk management, the HKMA conducted further additional on-site reviews to assess the market risk management of authorized institutions and required those with deficiencies in their monitoring to take corrective actions.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Activities\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) risk-based anti-money laundering regulatory framework includes on-site reviews and off-site reviews (including regulatory liaison with authorized institutions regarding specific events), primarily targeting areas with higher money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The review content covers the authorized institutions' assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the implementation of risk-based approaches, as well as systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. In 2016, the HKMA's specialist regulatory staff conducted 17 on-site reviews and 30 off-site reviews.\n\nIn terms of policy development, the HKMA prioritizes addressing situations where certain industries and individuals encounter difficulties in opening bank accounts, and issues guidelines and \"frequently asked questions\" to clarify certain customer due diligence requirements, as well as the HKMA's regulatory expectations regarding the risk-based approach. Meanwhile, the HKMA continues to closely cooperate with industry associations, issuing guidelines to help authorized institutions manage risks in certain areas, such as money laundering activities related to trade.\n"}

香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。去年的稅務修訂有助營造有利環境，吸引跨國公司在港設立企業財資中心。為發展香港成為基建融資中心與金融科技樞紐，金管局在年內成立基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室。年內金管局向儲值支付工具發行人批出13個牌照。香港穩健的財政表現及龐大的對外資產淨值，繼續獲得信貸評級機構確認，其中標準普爾維持對香港AAA的評級。\n\n# 概覽\n\n受到環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性影響，2016年全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。儘管如此，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，處理全球約七成人民幣支付交易。深港股票市場交易互聯互通機制「深港通」於12月推出，標誌着內地資本帳開放的另一里程碑，並且是提升香港的國際金融中心地位的重要一步。金管局亦透過擴大對市場的人民幣流動性支援及推出措施增加人民幣市場流動性的透明度，強化金融基建。\n\n金管局於7月成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，透過匯聚主要持份者促進基建發展，並發展香港成為基建融資中心。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴。年內金管局亦成功推動法例修訂的通過，以消除稅務不對稱及提供稅務優惠，鼓勵跨國及內地公司在香港設立企業財資中心，為金融及專業服務行業帶來更多商機。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構唯一設於阿布扎比以外的辦事處。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在去年的第四條磋商討論中對我們致力鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位給予正面評價。年內金管局積極參與國際討論，致力推進全球與區內金融穩定。金管局亦與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密溝通，有關工作有助香港的信貸評級在2016年獲得主要信貸評級機構確認。\n\n香港金融基建的安全有效運作與持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭力發揮重要作用。處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算(RTGS)系統及債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）在2016年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。\n\n金管局在2016年進一步加強香港的零售支付金融基建。年內根據2016年11月全面生效的《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）批出總共13個儲值支付工具牌照。電子支票服務涵蓋範圍亦已擴展至香港和廣東省（包括深圳）之間的跨境支付。\n\n為促進香港金融科技的發展，金管局於3月成立金融科技促進辦公室。年內實施的多項重要措施均取得理想進展。\n\n金管局推出一系列措施加強銀行業軟實力，包括(i)推出提升董事專業能力計劃；(ii)訂立整體業界的銀行從業員專業資歷架構；及(iii)推行消費者教育計劃。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 離岸人民幣業務\n\n2016年環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性令全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。截至年底，香港人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額合共為6,251億元人民幣，較上年減少38%（圖1）。年內離岸人民幣債券發行量降至528億元人民幣，經香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算額亦降至45,421億元人民幣。另一方面，香港銀行截至年底的人民幣貸款餘額為2,948億元人民幣，與上年相若（圖2）。人民幣RTGS系統的交易額維持於高位，於2016年平均每日處理的交易額為8,636億元人民幣。由此可見，儘管人民幣資金池有所縮減，但仍繼續支持大量人民幣金融中介活動在香港進行。根據環球銀行金融電信協會(SWIFT)統計數字，2016年香港處理約七成人民幣支付交易，足以證明香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n圖1 人民幣客戶存款及存款證\n\n圖2 人民幣融資活動\n\n年內金管局與內地有關當局緊密合作爭取更大政策空間，推展香港人民幣業務。年內推出多項新措施，包括進一步加大內地銀行間債券市場及外匯市場對外開放，以及在12月推出「深港通」。因應跨境投資渠道及市場對流動性管理需求增加，金管局擴大人民幣流動資金安排。於10月，金管局將一級流動性提供行的數目由7間增加至9間，有關計劃的總額度亦由140億元人民幣增加至180億元人民幣。金管局人民幣流動資金安排使用情況的透明度亦提高，有助參加行更有效管理流動資金。\n\n在3月公布的國家「十三五」規劃再次肯定香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，顯示中央政府支持香港進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續加強與其他經濟體的合作，發展離岸人民幣業務。金管局亦積極參加各類活動，推廣香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐及內地「走出去策略跳板的主要角色，包括參與業界組織及私營機構舉辦的本地活動，以及在中國內地、德國、哈薩克斯坦和英國等地的境外活動。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》框架下有關內地與香港基本實現服務貿易自由化的新協議，於2015年簽署。金管局繼續密切留意現行安排下的措施的實施情況，並與政府當局合作探討進步擴大內地市場對香港金融業的開放及便利措施。\n\n# 基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)\n\n# IFFO的使命\n\nIFFO的使命是透過匯聚主要持份者，共同促進基建投融資。IFFO的職能是：\n- 提供一個資訊交流和經驗分享的平台；\n- 提升基建投融資方面的技能和知識；\n- 推廣市場及產品發展；\n- 及促進基建投融資活動。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左七）於IFFO啟動儀式上聯同其他嘉賓祝酒。\n\n金管局於7月成立IFFO，其使命是透過匯聚主要持份者共同促進基建投融資。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間來自中國內地、香港及海外的機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴，當中包括多邊金融機構及發展銀行、公營機構投資者、私營機構投資者、資產管理公司、銀行、保險公司、基建項目發展及營運機構、專業服務公司及國際貿易協會（表1）。\n\nIFFO自成立以來取得良好進展。為致力提升技能，IFFO於10月聯同世界銀行集團旗下國際金融公司和瀚亞投資主辦行政人員工作坊，主題為「私營資金參與新興市場基建項目的投融資」。該工作坊獲得參與者非常正面的回應，有助增長知識及建立網絡。IFFO另於11月舉辦高層研討會，並邀請亞洲基礎設施投資銀行行長金立群先生主講及分享基建項目規劃、營運與管理的經驗。於7月，IFFO分別與國際金融公司及全球基礎設施中心簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，建立合作框架。另於12月分別與國家開發銀行及中國進出口銀行簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，透過IFFO平台促進該兩間銀行的基建項目融資。這些活動有助加強香港作為基建融資中心的地位及國際形象。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與國際金融公司執行副總裁兼首席執行官菲利普• 勒奧魯先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，促成兩者合作利用IFFO平台，為區內基建投融資營造更有效率及有利的市場環境。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與全球基礎設施中心首席執行官Chris Heathcote先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，建立策略性合作框架，促進基建項目融資。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）與國家開發銀行董事長胡懷邦先生簽署《諒解備忘錄》，加強該行與金管局的合作。\n\n# 企業財資中心\n\n為進一步吸引跨國公司在香港設立企業財資中心，金管局與政府當局合作，營造一個對企業財資中心有利的稅務環境。具體上，《2016年稅務（修訂）（第2號）條例》（《修訂條例》）於6月通過，容許企業在符合指明條件下，在計算利得稅時可獲扣減經營集團內部融資業務的利息支出，以及就合資格企業財資中心指明財資業務的利潤，寬減利得稅百分之五十（即降至8.25%）。表2簡載《修訂條例》部分要點：\n\n除立法工作外，金管局亦積極向跨國和內地企業推廣在香港設立企業財資中心的優勢。截至年底，金管局已接觸近400間公司、金融機構及行業組織。金管局亦於11月與香港中國企業協會簽署《諒解備忘錄》，協助香港的中資企業進一步了解及更多利用我們的企業財資中心平台。\n\n# 推廣資產管理業務\n\n金管局繼續致力推廣香港作為資產管理中心。根據證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），從事資產管理的持牌法團數目於2016年底為1,300間，按年增加近15%。根據《亞洲創業投資期刊》，2016年在香港的私募基金公司（包括證監會持牌法團及非證監會持牌法團）數目亦增加4.6%，至431間。迄今全球百大資產管理公司中有接近70間，以及內地二十大互惠基金公司中的大多數，已在香港設有業務或相聯公司。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構於阿布扎比以外設立的唯一辦事處。\n\n# 引入開放式基金型公司結構\n\n為吸引基金來港註冊，金管局繼續與政府及業界合作，營造更有利的稅務及監管環境。於6月，《2016年證券及期貨（修訂）條例草案》獲得通過，引入開放式基金型公司結構，令香港的基金註冊平台更多元化，並為基金經理營造更靈活的經營環境，從而加強香港作為國際資產管理中心的競爭力。\n\n# 伊斯蘭金融\n\n金管局繼續致力增加市場對伊斯蘭金融的認識和了解，包括聯同業界公會舉辦及參與伊斯蘭金融研討會及講座，並與市場參與者分享有關發行伊斯蘭債券的經驗，鼓勵它們使用香港的平台。繼成功發行上兩批伊斯蘭債券後，金管局與政府一直緊密合作，在市場條件合適時推出第三批伊斯蘭債券。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

Renminbi business hub. Last year's tax amendment helped create a conducive environment, attracting multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing centre and a fintech hub, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office within the year. Within the year, the HKMA granted 13 licences to issuers of stored value payment facilities. Hong Kong's sound fiscal performance and substantial net external asset position continue to receive confirmation from credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor's maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nAffected by global financial market volatility and uncertainty in the outlook for the RMB exchange rate, the global offshore RMB business slowed in 2016. Despite this, Hong Kong maintained its position as the global offshore RMB business hub, handling about 70% of global RMB payment transactions. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect mechanism, launched in December, marked another milestone in China's capital account liberalization and was an important step in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The HKMA also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding support for RMB liquidity in the market and introducing measures to increase the transparency of RMB market liquidity.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July, by bringing together key stakeholders to promote infrastructure development and develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing hub. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully pushed through legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetries and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, thereby bringing more business opportunities to the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing. Among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which is the world's third-largest sovereign fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, making it the only office of the institution located outside Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe IMF gave a positive evaluation of our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre during last year's Fourth Article consultation discussions. Within the year, the HKMA actively participated in international discussions, dedicated to advancing global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintains close communication with international credit rating agencies, and these efforts contributed to Hong Kong's credit rating receiving recognition from major credit rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe and effective operation with the sustainable development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure plays an important role in enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial centre and a global offshore RMB hub. The four real-time payment settlement (RTGS) systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) system for processing interbank transactions achieved 100% system availability in 2016, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority further strengthened Hong Kong's retail payment financial infrastructure in 2016. During the year, a total of 13 stored value facilities licenses were granted under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), which came into full effect in November 2016. The coverage of electronic cheque services has also been expanded to cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of Hong Kong's fintech, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. Several key measures implemented this year have all achieved ideal progress.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched a series of measures to strengthen the banking sector's soft power, including (i) launching the Enhancing Directors' Professional Capabilities Programme; (ii) establishing an overall industry framework for banking professionals' professional qualifications; and (iii) implementing a consumer education programme.\n\n# 2016 Review\n\n# Offshore RMB business\n\nGlobal financial market volatility and uncertainty regarding the RMB exchange rate outlook led to a moderation in global offshore RMB business activities. As of year-end, the combined balance of RMB deposits and deposit certificates held by Hong Kong's RMB customers amounted to RMB625.1 billion, a 38% decline compared to the previous year (Figure 1). Offshore RMB bond issuance during the year fell to RMB52.8 billion, while the RMB trade settlement amount processed through Hong Kong banks also dropped to RMB454.21 billion. On the other hand, Hong Kong banks' RMB loan balance stood at RMB294.8 billion as of year-end, similar to the previous year (Figure 2). The transaction volume on Hong Kong's RMB RTGS system remained at a high level, with an average daily processing amount of RMB863.6 billion in 2016. Despite the reduction in the RMB funding pool, Hong Kong continues to support substantial RMB financial intermediation activities. According to SWIFT statistics, Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of RMB payment transactions in 2016, confirming its status as the global offshore RMB business hub.\n\nChart 1 Renminbi Customer Deposits and Deposit Certificates\n\nFigure 2 RMB Financing Activities\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely cooperated with relevant mainland authorities to strive for greater policy space and promote the development of Hong Kong's RMB business. Several new measures were launched during the year, including further enhancing the openness of the mainland's interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, as well as introducing the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect\" in December. In response to increased demand for liquidity management in cross-border investment channels and markets, the HKMA expanded its RMB liquidity facilities. In October, the HKMA increased the number of Primary liquidity providers from seven to nine, and the total quota of the relevant program was also raised from RMB14 billion to RMB18 billion. The transparency of the usage of the HKMA's RMB liquidity facilities was also improved, helping participating banks manage liquidity more effectively.\n\nThe national \"13th Five-Year Plan\" announced in March reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as the global offshore RMB business hub, demonstrating the central government's support for Hong Kong to further develop its offshore RMB business.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore RMB business. The HKMA also actively participates in various activities to promote Hong Kong's role as a global offshore RMB business hub and as a key springboard for China's \"going out\" strategy. This includes participating in local events organized by industry organizations and private institutions, as well as overseas events in mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the UK.\n\n# The Arrangement on Establishing a Closer Trade and Economic Relationship between Mainland China and Hong Kong\n\nUnder the framework of the Arrangement for Closer Economic Partnership between Mainland China and Hong Kong, a new agreement on the basic realization of service trade liberalization between the mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the current arrangement, and works with government authorities to explore further expanding the opening up of the mainland market to Hong Kong's financial sector and facilitating measures.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\n\n# IFFO's mission\n\nIFFO's mission is to bring together key stakeholders to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing. IFFO's functions are:  \n- To provide a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;  \n- To enhance skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;  \n- To promote market and product development;  \n- And to facilitate infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nMr. Norman T.L. Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (7th from the left), joined other guests in toasting at the IFFO initiation ceremony.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established IFFO in July, with a mission to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. By the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project development and operations institutions, professional service companies, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made good progress since its establishment. To enhance skills, IFFO, in conjunction with the International Finance Corporation under the World Bank Group and Eastspring Investments, hosted an administrative staff workshop in October with the theme \"Private Capital Participation in Investment and Financing of Infrastructure Projects in Emerging Markets.\" The workshop received very positive responses from participants and helped enhance knowledge and build networks. IFFO also held a high-level seminar in November, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to deliver a keynote speech and share experience in planning, operation, and management of infrastructure projects. In July, IFFO signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Hub to establish a framework for cooperation. Additionally, in December, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding with the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Bank, facilitating infrastructure project financing for these two banks through the IFFO platform. These activities help strengthen Hong Kong's status as a financing center for infrastructure and its international image.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Chief Executive, Mr. Norman T.L. Chan (front left), and Mr. Philippe Le Roux, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the International Finance Corporation (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate cooperation in leveraging the IFFO platform, fostering a more efficient and conducive market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nThe Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Norman T.L. Chan (front left), signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Mr Chris Heathcote, Chief Executive Officer of the Global Infrastructure Centre (front right), to establish a strategic cooperation framework and promote infrastructure project financing.\n\nPresident of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Norman T.L. Chan (left), and Chairman of the China Development Bank, Mr. Hu Huaiyuan, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Enterprise Treasury Center\n\nTo further attract multinational companies to establish financial centres in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with government authorities to foster a favorable tax environment for corporate financial centres. Specifically, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (the \"Amended Ordinance\") was passed in June, allowing companies, under specified conditions, to deduct interest expenses incurred in operating internal financing businesses within their corporate groups when calculating profits tax, as well as reducing profits tax by 50% (i.e., down to 8.25%) on profits from specified financial services of qualifying corporate financial centres. Table 2 summarizes key points of the Amended Ordinance:\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA actively promotes the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and Mainland China enterprises. As of year-end, the HKMA has reached out to nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organisations. The HKMA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong China Enterprises Association in November, assisting Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong to further understand and more effectively leverage our corporate treasury centre platform.\n\n# Promote asset management business\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to promote Hong Kong as an asset management center. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management stood at 1,300 as of the end of 2016, representing an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. According to the Asia Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity fund companies in Hong Kong (including both SFC-licensed corporations and non-SFC-licensed corporations) also increased by 4.6% in 2016, reaching 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world's top 100 asset management companies, as well as most of the top 20 mainland mutual fund companies, have established operations or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with operations based in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing. Among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world's third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the only office set up outside Abu Dhabi by the institution.\n\n# Introduce open-ended fund company structure\n\nTo attract funds to register in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to collaborate with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the Bill for the 2016 Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance was passed, introducing an open-ended fund company structure, making Hong Kong's fund registration platform more diversified and providing fund managers with a more flexible operating environment, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international asset management center.\n\n# Islamic finance\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to be dedicated to increasing market understanding and awareness of Islamic finance, including organizing and participating in Islamic finance seminars and lectures in conjunction with industry associations, and sharing experience on issuing Islamic bonds with market participants, encouraging them to use Hong Kong's platform. Following the successful issuance of the previous two batches of Islamic bonds, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has maintained close cooperation with the government to launch the third batch of Islamic bonds when market conditions are appropriate.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖

financial markets experienced significant volatility and turbulence. Early in 2016, market concerns over the hard landing of the mainland economy and a global growth slowdown led to a sharp decline in global stock markets. June's UK Brexit referendum and November's US election results also came as surprises. Despite a challenging investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to enhance the resilience of the foreign exchange fund, enabling it to still record a 2% overall investment return in 2016.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary, and investments are made in securities or other assets deemed appropriate after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Management\n\n# Investment Target and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has formulated the following investment objectives for the Foreign Exchange Fund:  \n(a) Protect capital;  \n(b) Ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid US dollar assets;  \n(c) Ensure that liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and  \n(d) To the extent possible, maximize investment returns while preserving the Fund's long-term purchasing power, subject to the above (a) to (c).\n\nThe above targets fully take into account the statutory purposes of the foreign exchange fund and have been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the foreign exchange fund.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund is generally divided into two main portfolios: the support portfolio and the investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full support to the monetary base as per the regulations of the Currency Issuing Authority's system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and stock markets of OECD member countries, aiming to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets. Overall, the long-term target allocation ratio of bonds and equities in these two portfolios is 71 to 29. In terms of target currency allocation, 91% of assets are allocated to US dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has adopted a cautious and gradual approach to diversify part of the Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and mainland bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging market and mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, whereas private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund's cumulative surplus, but there is still room for the market value cap to increase in response to future fund allocations into long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, which the Government acquired for strategic purposes under the foreign exchange fund accounts. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its performance is not included in the investment performance assessment of the foreign exchange fund.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe foreign exchange fund from time to time accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for future fund deposits. The interest rate on future fund deposits is linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual interest rate depending on the portfolio mix. As of the end of 2016, the future fund's proportion in the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of future fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Procedure\n\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on strategic asset distribution and strategic asset distribution. Strategic asset distribution, which reflects the distribution indicated by the investment benchmark, shows the best long-term asset distribution that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic distribution as a guideline to implement strategic asset distribution in order to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, the actual distribution often deviates from the benchmark distribution (i.e., the strategic distribution), and the difference between the actual and benchmark distributions is referred to as \"strategic deviations.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Consultative Committee, formulated the investment benchmark and the limits of strategic deviations. The HKMA is authorized to determine the strategic asset distribution. Portfolio managers may select positions within the limits of strategic deviations to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nStaff in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Reserves Management Department directly manage approximately 74% of the investment in the foreign exchange fund, which includes the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio invests in the global fixed income market and executes the foreign exchange fund's macro risk management strategy through derivatives.\n\n#External Investment Managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also employs external investment managers responsible for managing approximately 26% of the foreign exchange fund's assets, which includes all listed stock portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the foreign exchange fund's investments, and to enable the foreign exchange fund to benefit from diversified investment approaches, as well as to allow internal professionals to gain market knowledge and information.\n\nExpenses related to employing external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding tax, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily subject to market factors and vary annually.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" (the \"Principles\") issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on March 7, 2016. The Principles are of a voluntary nature and aim to assist investors in determining how best to fulfill their ownership responsibilities regarding investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In terms of the management of the foreign exchange fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers appointed to manage Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles when managing the relevant investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, highlighting the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations; it also employs risk management tools to assess market risks under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed analysis of investment performance factors, aiming to most effectively utilize the investment management techniques of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Performance\n\n# 2016 financial market\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced significant volatility and turbulence. In terms of the stock market, concerns in January over a hard landing in the mainland economy and a global growth slowdown led to a sharp decline in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, which stabilized by mid-February. In June, the unexpected outcome of the UK Brexit referendum and in November, the surprising results of the US presidential election followed in succession, but stock markets quickly regained lost ground after experiencing only a brief decline. Overall for the year, global stock markets generally performed well.\n\nIn the bond market, the further decline in commodity prices in the first quarter deepened concerns over global growth moderation and low inflation, combined with uncertainties arising from the UK Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations of central banks maintaining accommodative policies, which increased demand for safe assets and supported solid performance of government bond markets in the first half of 2016. In particular, the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, US Treasury bond yields surged due to rising market expectations of US rate hikes, especially after the US presidential election. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, but to a lesser extent.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the US dollar exchange rate index rising to a 14-year high. The dollar's continued strength was supported by widening interest rate differentials between the dollar and other major currencies. Although the Japanese yen rose by about 3% against the dollar in 2016, the euro fell by about 3% against the dollar. Under the continued uncertainty caused by the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum, the British pound fell by 16% against the dollar during the year, marking the largest decline since 2008.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1: Market Investment Returns in 2016. Stock market performance is calculated based on the changes in index prices within the year.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Performance\n\nDespite the marked volatility in financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded HKD 68.1 billion in investment income in 2016, including HKD 28.6 billion in overseas equity returns, HKD 5.3 billion in Hong Kong equity returns, HKD 33.1 billion in bond returns, HKD 16.9 billion in other investment returns held by the Exchange Fund's investment holding subsidiaries, and a downward foreign exchange valuation adjustment of HKD 15.8 billion for non-HKD assets. This downward adjustment was inevitable due to the sharp rise in the USD exchange rate last year, which caused non-US dollar investments of the Exchange Fund to inevitably incur a foreign exchange valuation adjustment when converted into HKD. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 700 million.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the total assets of the foreign exchange fund reached 361.87 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments amounted to 181.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, which included 116.8 billion Hong Kong dollars in private equity and 65 billion Hong Kong dollars in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment was 133.8 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nDespite the ongoing challenges in the investment environment, the Exchange Fund still recorded a 2% investment return rate (excluding the strategic asset portfolio) in 2016. The long-term growth portfolio's annualized internal rate of return has been approximately 12% since the start of investments in 2009.\n\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has already implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years, including shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and markedly reducing non-dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated the pace of diversification efforts, especially in long-term growth portfolios. These measures have significantly enhanced the resilience of the foreign exchange fund.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rate of the Foreign Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 shows the investment return rate of the Foreign Exchange Fund in 2016, as well as the average investment return rates for different periods. The Foreign Exchange Fund's average return rate over the past 3 years was 0.9%, over the past 5 years was 2.0%, over the past 10 years was 2.6%, and from 1994 onwards was 4.8%. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Foreign Exchange Fund's assets as of December 31, 2016.\n\nFigure 1: Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate (1994 to 2016)\n\n1. The calculation of the investment return rate does not include assets within the strategic asset portfolio.  \n2. The Composite Consumer Price Index is calculated using a time series with 2014\/2015 as the base period.\n\nTable 2: Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Return Rate: In Hong Kong Dollars\n\n1. The investment return rate from 2001 to 2003 is calculated in US dollars. 2. The calculation of the investment return rate does not include assets within the strategic asset portfolios. 3.

加強監理能力，以管理銀行日益增加的科技風險及新的金融科技項目，以及應對銀行在區內及業務上的擴展；\n    - 加強打擊清洗黑錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動的監管及執法工作，並為2018年打擊清洗黑錢財務特別行動組織相互評估計劃作好準備；\n    - 作好實施《金融機構（處置機制）條例》的規劃及籌備工作，以根據國際標準處理金融業「大到不能倒」的問題；及\n    - 加強監理能力以配合有關資本及市場風險的新國際標準，並增撥資源處理消費者保障事宜及銀行投訴。\n- 因應進一步推動外匯基金投資產品多元化所牽涉的更多投資工作，加強投資、風險管理及其他相關支援，同時強化策略性資產分配及投資程序，以應對挑戰日增的投資環境。\n- 制定及實施人才發展計劃，並加強相關資源，確保金管局具備所需的人力資源應對市場發展及未來的挑戰。\n- 加強貨幣政策方面的研究及貨幣統計資料的處理，以及提供資源處理就儲值支付工具及零售支付系統的牌照╱指定及相關監管事宜而作出的查詢及投訴。\n\n表1按部門列出金管局的職位編制及實際職員人數。\n表1 2017年1月1日金管局職位編制及實際職員人數\n\n金管局調配臨時資源以應付其他工作，並借調員工至國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）及金融發展局，為香港或金管局有份參與的工作或政策提供協助。此外，金管局派調員工到香港存款保障委員會及財資市場公會，以提供全職或協助性質的運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬福利政策及薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會提供的意見，並參考市場薪酬水平及做法，決定金管局員工的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬組合包括現金薪酬及公積金，另設一些基本福利。現金薪酬包括每月固定薪酬（即基本薪酬）及根據員工工作表現每年一次過發放的浮動薪酬。\n\n財政司司長每年檢討金管局員工薪酬時，會透過外匯基金諮詢委員會聽取其轄下管治委員會的建議，並考慮管治委員會對金管局過去一年的表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融業薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。個別工作表現優秀的員工的薪酬亦可能獲得特別調整，以保持其薪酬競爭力。\n\n金管局按個別員工的工作表現，分配獲批准用作調整年度固定薪酬或發放浮動薪酬的款項；而用於專業投資人員的浮動薪酬制度，則旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬的連繫。助理總裁或以上職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，是由財政司司長經參考管治委員會的意見後批准，有關員工在會議討論到其薪酬的議案時會避席。主管及以下職級員工的固定薪酬調整或浮動薪酬的發放，則由金管局總裁根據財政司司長授權，並按照獲批准用作支付薪酬的整筆款項來決定。\n\n# 高層人員薪酬\n\n表2列載2016年高層人員的薪酬資料。\n\n1. 除累積年假外，服務不足1年的員工所得的實際薪酬會化作全年計算，以得出有關職級的平均全年薪酬。2. 本表所載員工人數包括服務不足1年的員工。高級助理總裁職級人數包括香港按揭證券有限公司總裁在內。3. 其他福利包括公積金、醫療及人壽保險，以及年內累積的年假。這些福利會因應個別高層人員的服務條件而有所不同。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising in","leveraging on","advance","promote","further"],"議題":["subjects","issues"],"支援":["support","technical support"],"體系":["system","banking system","sector"],"「":["“","\""],"已舉":["have been organised"],"預期":["expectation","expected","anticipate","forecasts","projects"],"並與":["and","and"],"啟動":["triggered","launch","initiation","launching"],"信貸":["credit"],"港":["Hong Kong"],"升至":["rose to","increased to","climbed to","edged up to","picked up to"],"為":["for","to","as","to help cope","foster","promote","to be","to render by","tobe","at","of","be","become"],"科技":["technology","fintech","Fintech","technological","tech","It"],"建":["developed","build","carry out","built","establish","established"],"多項":["several","multiple"],"多家":["several","several"],"人才":["talent","talent"],"近年":["over the years","in recent years","recent years"],"12":["12","December","twelve"],"重點":["priorities","highlights","key","major"],"特別":["especially","special"],"針對":["aimed at","in combating","with regard to"],"放程序":["the payout process","requirements and procedures"],"牆":["barriers"],"德霖":["Norman T.L.","Norman Chan"],"人民":["renminbi","Renminbi","RMB"],"流動":["liquidity","fund flows","mobile","liquid"],"價格":["prices"],"之稱":["known as"],"金融":["financial","finance","fintech","Fintech","Finance"],"紛紛":["several","several"],"培訓":["talent development","personnel training","training"],"銀行":["banks","banking","bank","banks’"],"申請":["applications","application","apply"],"微升":["a slight increase"],"上":["in","on","upwards"],"令美股":["led to an immediate plunge in the ...

media, public education initiatives, and other various channels to enhance public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen institutional governance, including supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing information technology security, to cope with the challenges brought about by the implementation of new measures and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# Institutional Development in Maintaining Contact with the Public\n\n# Public Communication\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains close links with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and work. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 81 public media activities, including 14 press conferences, 13 stand-up interviews, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. During the year, 326 bilingual press releases were published, and a large number of media enquiries were processed daily.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established two important offices, namely the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain their functions and work plans, the HKMA conducted multiple public communication initiatives. Additionally, the HKMA hosted media briefings and seminars to deepen the public's understanding of the HKMA's operations and measures in multiple areas, including financial inclusion, reserves management, fintech regulatory sandbox, cybersecurity, and small and medium-sized enterprise financing.\n\nMr. Norman T.L. Chan, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, met with journalists when he attended the Hong Kong Bankers' Association's annual Beijing trip in December 2016.\n\n# Public Enquiries\n\nThe public inquiry service is an effective channel for the public to inquire about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's functions and work-related information. This service handled 10,170 inquiries in 2016, an increase of 12% compared to 2015. About half of the inquiries involved banking sector policies and regulations, monetary and economic matters, as well as banking consumer issues, especially banking products and services, coin collection programs, banking-related guidelines and notices, stored value payment facilities and retail payment systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing activities, and prudent regulatory measures for property mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public inquiries received each year since 2013, and Figure 2 lists the proportion accounted for by various types of inquiries in 2016.\n\n# Publication\n\nIn addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin during the year. It regularly updated the data in the Monthly Financial Statistics Report, providing the latest and thematic information and analysis on Hong Kong's monetary affairs, banking sector, and economic matters. In addition, the HKMA published 32 Hui Si articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 articles in 2015, elaborating on multiple thematic issues related to the HKMA's work.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's \"Annual Report 2015\" received the Silver award in the \"non-profit and charitable institutions\" category at the Hong Kong Management Association's 2016 Annual Best Annual Report Selection.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of Phase 2 of the International Financial Centre. It introduces the public to the HKMA's work and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking affairs. The Information Centre consists of two parts: an exhibition hall and a library, which are open to the public for visiting and use six days a week. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work as well as the development of Hong Kong's monetary and banking sectors; it also provides reading materials and exhibits for researching Hong Kong's monetary, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe policy exhibition area of the Information Centre, which explains the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and introduces related financial knowledge, underwent renovation works in the 4th quarter of 2016. This made the exhibition content more enriched and added various interactive elements, especially interactive games that combine learning with play, clearly and simply explaining financial concepts. The exhibition also features touchscreen displays with rich visuals and text, providing a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the HKMA's work, aiming to bring visitors a completely new visiting experience. Additionally, the renovated Information Centre now features a mosaic artwork created using over 130,000 Hong Kong coins to depict the view of Victoria Harbour. The newly revamped policy exhibition area has been reopened to the public on February 24, 2017.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and Chinese (both traditional and simplified characters), facilitating public access to the latest updates from the Authority. The website also contains the \"Register of Authorized Institutions' Securities Business Employees\" and the \"Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices,\" maintained under Article 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the \"Register of Licensees of Stored Value Payment Facilities,\" maintained under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features thematic webpages and prominent quick links to remind the public of the Authority's new measures, such as the regulatory regime for stored value payment facilities, IFFO and FFO, and important and timely matters, including awareness of telephone scams and the parking locations of cash collection vehicles for the coin collection program.\n\nThe completely new image of the Information Centre's policy exhibition area.\n\nA mosaic artwork created using Hong Kong coins to depict the scenery of Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe information centre provides guidance services for visitors. During the year, the information centre received over 56,200 visitors and provided over 580 guidance services to schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the information centre has cumulatively received over 586,600 visitor visits.\n\nThe library adjacent to the exhibition hall houses over 23,000 books, journals, and other publications for in-depth research on subjects including Hong Kong currency, the banking sector, finance, and central banking affairs. The library also maintains an electronic register of employees engaged in securities business at authorized institutions and local representative offices, as stipulated in Article 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work, the Authority continues to organize public education seminars. In 2016, the Authority held three open seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary students and teachers, with topics including the linked exchange rate system, banking system stability, Hong Kong banknotes, smart tips on using banking-related products and services, and the deposit protection scheme. Since its launch in 1998, the education seminars have attracted over 56,400 members of the public.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in various districts attended one of the public education seminars.\n\nFigure 3: Categories of Groups Visiting the Information Centre in 2016\n\n# Person Resources\n\nThe HKMA hires, trains, and maintains a professional and excellent workforce to implement policy objectives and flexibly respond to changes in work priorities. As part of the government structure, the HKMA employs staff under non-civil service terms to attract talents with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public institution, the HKMA strives to maintain a streamlined and flexible organizational structure, and as far as possible, implements new measures and copes with the increasing workload by allocating existing staff.\n\n# Staff Establishment\n\nThe HKMA's staffing establishment was 875 people in early 2016. The HKMA established 12 positions in the second half of 2016 to fulfill its regulatory functions under the new insurance industry regulatory regime. Therefore, the HKMA's staffing establishment was 887 people by the end of 2016.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new legislation and policies, continuing ongoing pilot trials, and managing increasingly complex and demanding tasks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) increased its overall staffing by 40 personnel to 927 (an increase of 4.5%) in 2017. The newly created positions are responsible for the following functions:  \n- Promote the stability of the banking and financial system, including:  \n    - Enhancing regulatory capabilities to manage the growing technological risks faced by banks and new fintech initiatives, as well as responding to banks' expansion within the region and their business operations;  \n    - Strengthening supervisory and law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and preparing for the mutual evaluation program under the 2018 Special Anti-Money Laundering Financial Action;  \n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance to address the \"too big to fail\" issue in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and  \n    - Enhancing regulatory capabilities to align with new international standards on capital and market risks, while allocating additional resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.  \n- Strengthening investment, risk management, and related support in response to the increased investment activities involved in further promoting the diversification of foreign exchange fund investment products, while reinforcing strategic asset allocation and investment procedures to cope with increasingly challenging investment environments.  \n- Developing and implementing talent development programs and enhancing related resources to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to address market developments and future challenges.  \n- Strengthening research on monetary policy and the processing of monetary statistics, as well as providing resources to handle inquiries and complaints regarding licensing\/designation and related regulatory matters concerning stored value payment facilities and retail payment systems.\n\nTable 1 lists the establishment and actual number of staff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) by department.  \nTable 1: Position Establishment and Actual Staff Numbers of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as of January 1, 2017\n\nThe HKMA reallocates temporary resources to cope with other tasks and transfers staff to international or local institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to provide assistance for work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved. In addition, the HKMA deploys staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Committee and the Treasury and Markets Association to provide full-time or supportive operational assistance.\n\n# Remuneration and Benefits Policies and Remuneration Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary listens to the feedback provided by the governance committees under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and refers to market salary levels and practices, to determine the remuneration and service conditions for Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees. The remuneration package includes cash salary and provident fund, along with some basic benefits. Cash salary comprises a monthly fixed salary (i.e., basic salary) and annual variable pay disbursed based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the remuneration of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and considering recommendations from its governance committee, as well as the committee's assessment of HKMA's performance over the past year, the results of a salary survey conducted by an independent human resources consultancy in the financial industry, and other relevant factors. Employees with outstanding individual performance may also receive special adjustments to maintain their remuneration competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates approved funds for adjusting annual fixed remuneration or issuing variable pay to individual employees based on their work performance. The variable pay system for professional investment personnel aims to strengthen the link between investment performance and compensation. Adjustments to fixed remuneration or issuance of variable pay for assistant chief executives and higher-level employees are approved by the Financial Secretary (FS) after consulting the Governance Committee. Employees are excused from attending meetings when their remuneration proposals are discussed. For managers and lower-level employees, adjustments to fixed remuneration or issuance of variable pay are determined by the HKMA Chief Executive, based on the lump sum approved for salary payments, in accordance with authorization from the Financial Secretary (FS).\n\n# Senior Executive Remuneration\n\nTable 2 lists the remuneration data of senior executives in 2016.\n\n1. In addition to accumulated annual leave, the actual remuneration of employees with less than one year of service is calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual remuneration for the relevant position. 2. The number of employees listed in this table includes those with less than one year of service. The number of personnel in the Senior Assistant President position includes the President of Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited. 3. Other benefits include the pension fund, medical and life insurance, as well as accumulated annual leave within the year. These benefits may vary depending on the service conditions of individual senior personnel.\n"}
{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

Government Audit Office\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Feedback\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"Group\") listed on pages 149 to 237, which include the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and the income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and cash flow statements for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that these financial statements fairly and accurately reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The Basis of Feedback\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. The responsibilities I must assume under these standards are detailed in the section of this report titled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities Regarding the Audit of the Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities in line with these standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is adequate and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, based on my professional judgment, were most important to the audit of the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2016. I addressed these matters in auditing the overall financial statements and forming my opinion thereon, and I did not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n# Audit Office Director Report (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow do I handle the relevant matters in the audit?\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled 31,989.75 billion Hong Kong dollars, and financial liabilities totaled 9,639.77 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\n95% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are measured at the quoted price of the same assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 parameters), or estimated using valuation methods where the parameters used are based on observable market data (Level 2 parameters).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The related financial assets amount to 1,758.86 billion Hong Kong dollars, mainly consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nIn light of the substantial amount involved and the involvement of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:  \n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;  \n- Evaluating and testing monitoring measures, including monitoring measures related to application programs in computer systems;  \n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;  \n- If market quotes are used, verifying the prices against independent sources;  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is suitable and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the parameters against independent sources; and  \n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n#Future Fund Deposit\n\nPlease refer to the notes to the financial statements 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28.\n\nIn previous years, the majority of deposits in fiscal reserves had to be repaid when required, and interest was calculated based on a fixed rate determined annually by referencing the investment portfolio's past investment returns.\n\nThe Government established the Future Fund within the fiscal reserves on January 1, 2016. The Future Fund's deposits include initial funds from the land fund surplus (amounting to 219.73 billion Hong Kong dollars), as well as regular contributions from the government's general revenue account, with the amounts directed by the Financial Secretary. The interest on the Future Fund's deposits is calculated based on a composite interest rate, which is determined on a weighted average basis annually, referencing the aforementioned fixed interest rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and real estate investments). Unless otherwise instructed by the Financial Secretary, the deposits of the Future Fund, along with the interest earned, should be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Future Fund had deposits totaling 2,245.30 billion Hong Kong dollars. The cumulative interest on these deposits amounted to 100.71 billion Hong Kong dollars. Due to the substantial amounts involved and significant changes in deposit conditions, special attention is required regarding the measurement, reporting methods, and disclosure information related to the deposits and the interest earned.\n\nRegarding future Fund deposits, audit procedures include:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies used for the measurement of deposits and the interest earned thereon are appropriate;\n- Reviewing the calculation method for the annual rate of return linked to the performance of long-term growth portfolios;\n- Verifying the calculation of fixed rates determined based on the historical performance of the investment portfolio, the annual rate of return linked to the performance of long-term growth portfolios, and the composite rate determined based on these two rates;\n- Verifying the accrued interest amount calculated using the composite rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation method of deposits and the interest earned thereon in the financial statements and the disclosure information.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Property Accounted for at Fair Value\n\nPlease participate in the financial statements notes 2.12, 17, and 18.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, amounting to HK$22.723 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in three linked companies and 14 joint ventures, whose primary business is holding overseas investment properties, with these interests valued at HK$32.083 billion. Regardless of whether the investment properties are directly held by the Group or held through linked companies or joint ventures, their fair values are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:  \n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports of investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associate companies or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Specialist must be responsible for other information. Other information includes all information within the Monetary Authority's 2016 Annual Report, but excludes financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not publish any form of certification conclusion regarding other information.\n\nIn the context of a financial statement audit, I have the responsibility to read other information and consider whether this information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or the circumstances I became aware of during the audit, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have already performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report this fact. In this regard, I have no reports.\n\n# The responsibilities that the Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee must bear regarding financial statements.\n\nThe Monetary Authority Officer must be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Accountants Association and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls deemed necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the monetary authority specialist is responsible for assessing the group's capacity to continue operations, and disclosing matters related to continued operations where applicable, and using continued operations as the accounting basis.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for supervising the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The responsibilities an auditor must undertake regarding the audit of financial statements.\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the overall financial statements contain no material misstatements caused by fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot ensure that audits conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements can be caused by fraud or error, and they are considered material if it is reasonably expected that they individually or in aggregate may affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nIn conducting the audit in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatements in the financial statements arising from fraud or error; design and execute audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or situations where internal controls are overridden, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error;\n- Understand the internal controls related to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Monetary Authority's practice of using continuing operations as the accounting basis is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the relevant disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained as of the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Consultation Committee regarding the audit scope and timeline of the plan, as well as significant audit findings, including any major deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n"}
