{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","en":"# Chairman's Report\n\nThe global political and economic stage in 2016 was frequently marked by \"black swan\" events. While the Brexit referendum and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election certainly rendered various polls obsolete, what was even more unexpected was the reaction of financial markets. Taking the U.S. election as an example, news of Donald Trump's victory caused the futures of the three major U.S. stock indices to sharply decline before the market opened. However, shortly after the market opened, the U.S. stock indices quickly rebounded and subsequently continued to rise, setting new records repeatedly. This series of events highlighted the limitations of traditional wisdom and frameworks in predicting market movements, and marked a significant level of uncertainty in future global developments.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial indicators have reflected unusually sensitive market sentiment: the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July, then surged to 2.6% by mid-December following the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar's performance against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high by year-end. Meanwhile, New York crude oil futures prices rebounded from a year-start low of $26 per barrel to $54 by year-end. In Hong Kong's stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 86 points for the year, though the peak-to-trough difference during the period exceeded 6,000 points. Against this backdrop of turbulent external conditions, the importance and value of financial stability—particularly in the monetary and banking systems—have become even more evident.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors of international hedge funds planning to target the RMB and HKD were rampant, causing widespread anxiety. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) promptly issued clear and resolute messages to the market, emphasizing our absolute confidence and capability in safeguarding the linked exchange rate system and the stability of Hong Kong's financial system, which timely restored market confidence. Throughout 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained consistently close to the strong-side exchange rate guarantee. Due to the ample liquidity in the banking system, even the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes in December 2015 and March 2016 did not immediately and significantly affect the Hong Kong dollar's interest rates or exchange rate.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system continues to develop steadily, with overall loans recording a moderate growth of 6.5% last year. Asset quality remains strong, with the non-performing loan ratio maintained at a healthy level of 0.85%, significantly lower than the long-term average of around 2% since 2000. The banking system's capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio both remain at high levels well above statutory requirements. In the mortgage sector, following seven rounds of countercyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages has decreased from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio has also declined from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing the necessary buffer should the housing cycle reverse and impact the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to closely monitor the development of the housing market and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nLegislative efforts to further strengthen the stability of the banking system made encouraging progress last year. Two key pieces of legislation—optimizing the deposit insurance system and addressing the risks associated with \"too big to fail\" financial institutions—were promptly passed before the end of the previous Legislative Council term. The first law accelerates the disbursement of deposit insurance funds and simplifies the process, thereby enhancing depositors' confidence in the banking system. The second establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks arising from their potential collapse and to minimize the need to use public funds to bail them out. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has already established a Resolution Mechanism Office on April 1st of this year to implement the requirements of the legislation and oversee follow-up actions.\n\nThe banking industry is often referred to as the \"mother of all industries,\" serving as a vital channel for savings, payments, and credit for the real economy and the general public's daily lives. This year, some representatives from the SME sector reported difficulties in obtaining financing. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) promptly communicated with the banking sector, urging banks to continue providing financial support for SME operations and development while maintaining prudent risk management. We also leveraged our subsidiary, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, to enhance the promotion of the government's SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to the business community. We maintained close communication with the banking sector to address concerns, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for bad debts, thereby increasing banks' willingness to participate in the program. Through these multifaceted measures, we have achieved some success. According to the HKMA's survey of banks, the overall credit facilities for SMEs remained stable last year, with over 90% of businesses maintaining or even increasing their credit limits. Meanwhile, the number of applications for the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme has also risen significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has actively promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services have become an essential part of both business operations and daily life. Last year, after learning that some overseas companies and startups were encountering difficulties in opening accounts in Hong Kong, we immediately initiated follow-up actions, contacting multiple international chambers of commerce and business associations, and engaging in in-depth discussions with the banking sector to address the root causes. In September last year, I issued a notice to all Hong Kong banks, explaining how to understand the HKMA's \"risk-based\" regulatory principles concerning anti-money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and how to apply these principles to account opening procedures and due diligence measures for existing customers. The notice emphasized that banks should not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach for all clients. Following consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account openings has improved, but there is still room for further progress, which remains one of our key priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently encouraged banks, while pursuing commercial interests, to also take into account the basic banking service needs of the public. As fintech advances rapidly, the channels through which banks provide services are becoming increasingly diversified. In addition to the growing popularity of online banking, several banks launched mobile banking vans or video teller machine services last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. Under our initiative, multiple banks have also planned to establish physical branches in remote areas to enhance services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial center is like sailing against the current; therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continuously sought new opportunities and explored new areas for the growth of Hong Kong's financial industry over the years. 2016 proved to be a year of significant achievements, with Fintech and infrastructure financing standing out as key highlights.\n\nIn the field of fintech, Hong Kong's retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued 13 stored value token licenses, creating a favorable business environment for retail payment services through licensing and an ongoing regulatory framework. Coupled with a series of public education campaigns, consumers can enjoy the convenience brought by new technologies while their rights are appropriately protected.\n\nIn addition, in March last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Fintech Promotion Office to promote fintech development related to the banking sector through this platform. Within a few months, we launched several new initiatives, including the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative, which established a new three-pronged platform for strengthening the banking sector's cybersecurity through risk assessment, information sharing, and talent training. We also collaborated with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct specialized research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its feasibility for application in Hong Kong's banking sector. Furthermore, we set up a Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to the banking industry and the fintech sector. The HKMA's banking regulatory department also introduced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, allowing banks to test new technologies within a smaller and controlled environment, thereby accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks have tested 14 new technology projects using the sandbox, with some of these projects already launched in the market, bringing more fintech products to the public.\n\nThere is a huge global demand for infrastructure financing, especially since the proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has made infrastructure financing a focal topic for both domestic and international attention. As Asia's international financial center, Hong Kong holds significant advantages in the field of infrastructure financing. In July last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), creating a novel and unique platform that brings together over 60 world-class multilateral institutions, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, as well as infrastructure project developers and operators, and various professional organizations, to exchange information, share experiences, and seek collaboration opportunities on infrastructure investment and financing issues. Since its establishment, IFFO has organized more than a dozen large conferences, seminars, and workshops. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although its operational period is relatively short, it has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's future role as a hub for infrastructure investment and financing.\n\nRemoving barriers and loosening restrictions is the sure way to enhance competitiveness. This year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has actively participated in and supported the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government's revision of tax regulations, providing a favorable tax environment for companies operating internal financial services within Hong Kong. We have also actively engaged with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their financial activities in Hong Kong, thereby further enhancing the functionality of Hong Kong's financial market.\n\nThe offshore RMB market was in an adjustment phase last year. Influenced by market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the size of global offshore RMB pools generally contracted. Nevertheless, Hong Kong remained the leader in offshore RMB business, maintaining the world's largest RMB pool, with daily RMB settlement amounts through Hong Kong remaining at a high level of approximately 860 billion yuan. To further optimize liquidity arrangements in Hong Kong's offshore RMB market, we increased the number of primary liquidity providers from seven to nine in October last year, and raised the total quota for bilateral liquidity support from 140 billion yuan to 180 billion yuan, ensuring that the offshore RMB market can continue to operate orderly even in the event of liquidity shortages. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December last year further boosted Hong Kong's RMB business. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also working with relevant mainland authorities to study the Bond Connect framework, aiming to further facilitate participation of investors from both regions in bond markets and enhance connectivity of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite the volatile global investment environment last year, the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HKD 68.1 billion, thanks to various defensive measures implemented over the past period. Since 1994, the fund's compound annual investment return rate has reached 4.8%, exceeding the local inflation rate of 2.1% during the same period.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including further expanding asset classes and increasing investments in credit assets, inflation-protected investment products, and emerging markets. As the flagship of diversified investments, the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" invests in alternative assets such as private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has maintained strong performance, with an average annual internal rate of return of approximately 12% since its establishment. With part of the government's \"Future Fund\" allocated to this portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. As of the end of last year, the asset size of the \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio\" was approximately HKD 181.8 billion, with total approved but undrawn funds for investment amounting to approximately HKD 133.8 billion. The Foreign Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of \"capital preservation first, long-term value growth,\" seeking stable returns in the long term while maintaining ample liquidity and contingency funds.\n"}

Throughout the year, Hong Kong's stock market and residential property market have experienced fluctuations, with property affordability remaining tight.\n\nDespite the increasing risks and shocks in global markets, Hong Kong's banking system remains resilient. Bank capital and liquidity conditions remain strong; asset quality has slightly deteriorated but remains at healthy levels.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nDespite the volatile external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has remained stable, reflecting the linked exchange rate system's ability to withstand external shocks.\n\nThe money market continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity in the interbank sector. In December, following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, Hong Kong's benchmark interest rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.00%.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is strengthening the regulatory framework for banks' risk governance, as well as their management of credit, liquidity, and technology risks. The HKMA is also taking specific measures to promote financial inclusion and address the challenges businesses face in Hong Kong when opening and maintaining bank accounts.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policy, significant progress has been made in preparing Hong Kong for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards, including the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nHong Kong retains its position as a global offshore RMB business hub and asset management center. The tax system has been further refined to create a more favorable environment, attracting multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong.\n\nTo develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing hub and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Promotion Office and the Fintech Promotion Office. The HKMA smoothly commenced the implementation of the regulatory framework for stored value payment tools and retail payment systems, and issued 13 licenses for stored value payment tools.\n\n# Reserve Management\n\nDespite the challenging investment environment, which is littered with black swan events, the foreign exchange fund recorded an overall investment return of 2%, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented over the past few years that enhanced its resilience.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accelerating the pace of diversified investments, particularly in long-term growth portfolios.\n\n# Institutional Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with society and the market through media, public education activities, and other channels to enhance the public's understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strengthen institutional governance, including promoting employees to enhance their professional capabilities, strictly controlling finances, and enhancing IT security, to address the challenges posed by implementing new measures and increasingly heavy workloads.\n"}

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖 6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith the global economy and trade activities weakening, Hong Kong's economic growth softened in 2016. Amid heightened uncertainties in the external environment, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real local GDP growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with weakness in the inbound tourism sector putting pressure on service exports (Figure 1). Local demand momentum also slowed, although it continued to provide the primary support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained largely stable, with the unemployment rate maintained at a low level of 3.3 to 3.4%. Consumer price inflation further eased as local cost and external price pressures abated. Facing a volatile external environment and changing market conditions, asset markets experienced increased volatility. In response to the resurgence of the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite external market fluctuations and rising U.S. interest rates, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and monetary markets continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot rate, after slightly weakening in January, has remained hovering around the 7.75 level. The exchange guarantee was not triggered during the year, and the total surplus combined with outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds remained almost unchanged at approximately HKD 120 billion. Following the U.S. interest rate hike in mid-December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised its basic interest rate from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank rates and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels, though they rose slightly towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the trends in corresponding U.S. interbank rates and yields. Overall bank loan growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although overall loan quality slightly deteriorated, the ratio of specifically classified loans remained at an extremely low level.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1: Real GDP Growth by Expenditure Items (Compared to Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly rate of change in total local fixed capital formation is not available.  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Local Demand\n\nThe growth momentum of local demand slightly weakened in 2016. Although stable employment and income conditions continued to support private consumption, its growth rate fell to 1.6%, partly reflecting heightened economic uncertainties. Government consumption growth also slowed slightly to 3.3%. Total local fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Figure 2), resulting in a cumulative annual contraction of 0.5%. Private sector purchases of machinery and equipment remained the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid poor business outlooks, while residential construction activity turned positive due to increased housing starts.\n\nFigure 2: Local Demand. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# External Requirements\n\nHong Kong's exports showed signs of stabilization near the end of 2016, but the overall annual performance remained weak (Figure 3). Goods exports increased by 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Hong Kong's exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015, as regional trade flows became more stable.\n\nPartially reflecting the normalization of retail sales following a rapid growth in recent years, Hong Kong's service exports contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Goods imports, which had declined in 2015, partially recovered in 2016, while service imports continued to grow, partially benefiting from increased travel intentions among local residents. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, hampering local economic growth.\n\nFigure 3: Goods Exports and Services Exports. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflation pressures remained under control in 2016. Excluding the impact of one-time government relief measures, the core inflation rate fell from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Figure 4). The inflation component of rent in the composite consumer price index declined due to the transmission effect of earlier adjustments in private residential rents. Import price inflation was suppressed, benefiting from softer global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar. On the other hand, local cost pressures remained moderate, supported by stable labor cost growth and eased rental cost pressures, particularly in the retail sector.\n\nFigure 4 Core Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n#LaborMarket\n\nThe labor market remained largely stable in 2016, with similar increases in both labor supply and demand. By industry, labor market conditions in tourism-related sectors deteriorated, while other sectors remained largely stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Figure 5). Under the stable labor market, nominal wages increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared to a 1.5% increase in 2015.\n\nFigure 5: Labor Market Conditions. Source: Government Statistics Department.\n\n#StockMarket\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant fluctuations in 2016. Affected by the depreciation pressure on the yuan and volatility in the mainland stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). The Hong Kong stock market rebounded in March, following the significant recovery of the US and other major stock markets. Although the Brexit referendum triggered market volatility, market sentiment quickly improved under expectations that the US Federal Reserve would slow its rate hikes and other major central banks would implement monetary easing policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, the Hong Kong stock market faced renewed pressure in the fourth quarter, affected by the results of the US presidential election and expectations of accelerated interest rate hikes in the US. Overall, the Hang Seng Index mildly rose by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. The average daily turnover dropped from HKD 105.6 billion in the previous year to HKD 66.9 billion, while the total fundraising amount of the Hong Kong stock market also fell from HKD 1,115.6 billion to HKD 490.1 billion.\n\nFigure 6 Asset Prices  \nSource: Rates and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n#PropertyMarket\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight fluctuations in 2016. After reaching a historical low in the first quarter, property transaction volume recovered in the following months but plummeted again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, the transaction volume in 2016 slightly decreased to 54,701 transactions. On the other hand, property prices rose since the second quarter and surpassed the previous peak in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% in 2016 (Figure 6). Home affordability remained tight, with a price-to-income ratio of 15.9, exceeding the historical high in 1997; the income leverage ratio was 72.0%, far above the long-term average. Due to banks introducing competitive mortgage plans, mortgage rates slightly declined but rebounded slightly towards the end of the year as they followed the rise in Hong Kong interbank offered rates. In the commercial property market, the annual trading volume remained largely stable. Due to non-residential property prices falling from the 2015 peak, the corresponding rental yield slightly increased compared to the previous year but still remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nIt is expected that real local GDP growth in 2017 will remain moderate. The government forecasts economic growth to range between 2% and 3%, while private sector analysts predict an average increase of 2.0%. Externally, as global macroeconomic and financial conditions become more uncertain, global economic and trade growth may remain moderate. Additionally, the rise in the Hong Kong dollar's real effective exchange rate, driven by a strong US dollar, is likely to dampen Hong Kong's export performance. Locally, while stable employment and income conditions are expected to support consumption, private consumption is anticipated to grow only modestly due to rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of multiple infrastructure projects, construction and building activities are expected to grow steadily. However, weak business sentiment and rising interest rates are likely to affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in 2017. On one hand, rising global commodity prices and increasing inflation in mainland China may push up import prices. On the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar may help to mitigate these pressures. Under moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures are expected to remain manageable. However, the rise in new residential rents in early 2017 may lead to a slight increase in inflation within the rental component of the composite consumer price index. The market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government expects the core inflation rate to be 2.0%. Although heightened uncertainties may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertain Factors and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be constrained by numerous uncertainties, with external factors being particularly significant. The uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new U.S. administration will make the global economic outlook more uncertain, and potential protectionist policies could pose resistance to global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries could also lead to asset market volatility and affect the flow of Hong Kong dollars. Additionally, the normalization of U.S. interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices; the housing market remains tight, and the market outlook remains highly uncertain. In the short term, residential demand will be supported by low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and real estate developers offering additional incentives such as discounts and cash rebates, which help unlock accumulated purchasing power. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, the potential for the U.S. to accelerate rate hikes, and steady growth in housing supply may continue to pose resistance to the housing market.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nDespite challenges facing Hong Kong's economy and the unexpected outcomes of international political events that exacerbated market volatility, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2016. Authorized institutions maintained strong capital and liquidity positions, with asset quality slightly deteriorating but still remaining at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest Rate Trend\n\nWith the rise in U.S. interest rates, Hong Kong interbank rates significantly increased in November and December. The composite interest rate reflecting the cost of Hong Kong dollar funds for retail banks rose slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Hong Kong Interbank Call Rate, Composite Interest Rate, and Prime Lending Rate\n\nNotes:\n1. The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (monthly average) is published by the Hong Kong Bankers' Association.\n2. The Best Loan Rate (monthly average) is referenced based on the rate reported by HSBC Limited.\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nThe retail bank's profit slightly improved in 2016, with its Hong Kong operations' overall pre-tax operating profit increasing by 8.7%. The growth was primarily driven by foreign exchange and derivatives business income (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), although part of the growth was offset by a decrease in expenses and commission income (-11.3%). The retail bank's after-tax profit rose by 44.4%, driven mainly by non-recurring items. The retail bank's after-tax average return on assets also increased correspondingly from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Performance of Retail Banking\n\nThe net interest margin for retail banking in 2016 was 1.32%, the same as in 2015 (Figure 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate remaining funds to financial investments with lower interest rates and higher liquidity, the decline in interest income was offset by the reduction in interest costs.\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Net Interest Margin\n\nNon-interest income from retail banking accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, remaining largely stable. Although fees and commission income declined by 11.3%, dividend income and foreign exchange and derivatives business income increased by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","en":"# Currency Stability\n\nDespite external volatility and rising US interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable in 2016. The Hong Kong currency market also continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity in the interbank sector. The linked exchange rate system continued to demonstrate high resilience to shocks, serving as the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, i.e., ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system mainly adopts a currency board system, stipulating that the USD reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% support for the monetary base; whenever the monetary base changes, the USD reserves must also be proportionally increased or decreased to fully align with the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Promissory notes (providing full support for banknotes issued by three issuing banks)\n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins\n- The total balance of settlement accounts held by banks with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., total reserves)\n- Foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued on behalf of the government by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to upholding the exchange rate guarantee. If market demand for Hong Kong dollars exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing the total surplus and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back from the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level to within the exchange rate band of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if there is an excess supply of Hong Kong dollars, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing the total surplus and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thus bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back from the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level to within the exchange rate band.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nAfter slight fluctuations in the first two months of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained within a narrow range for the rest of the year. The Hong Kong dollar significantly weakened against the US dollar at the beginning of 2016, falling from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Figure 1). This weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was in line with the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve's December 2015 interest rate hike. In addition, other market-related factors, including the sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, less optimistic economic outlooks for both mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the renminbi exchange rate, and the general weakness of Asian currencies, all contributed to a decline in demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improved market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate slightly strengthened in February and remained within a narrow range between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onwards, unaffected even by market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Due to market expectations of a US interest rate hike in the summer, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced temporary weakening pressure in May. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1: 2016 Market Exchange Rate\n\nSince the exchange guarantee was not triggered, the total surplus and the outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund notes and bonds remained largely stable at around HKD 122.22 billion in 2016 (Figure 2). During the year, the HKMA issued an additional HKD 132 billion in foreign exchange fund notes to meet the substantial liquidity management needs of banks, resulting in the total surplus decreasing to HKD 25.96 billion by the end of 2016. The issuance of additional foreign exchange fund notes is in line with the principles of the currency board system, as such issuance merely represents a transfer within the components of the monetary base—from the total surplus to outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds—while the monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: Total Surplus and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds in 2016\n\n# Money Market\n\nHong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Figure 3). During January and February, HIBOR faced some upward pressure due to heightened financial market volatility, but stabilized in March as the financial environment calmed down. In the second and third quarters, despite market concerns over the outcome of the UK's Brexit referendum and reforms in the US money market fund sector, HIBOR remained largely stable. In the fourth quarter, HIBOR recorded a significant increase, partly due to year-end funding demand and the catch-up of Hong Kong dollar rates to the rise in US dollar rates. Nevertheless, short-term HIBOR remained largely below the base rate level throughout 2016.\n\nIn response to the increase in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range from 0.25% to 0.50% to 0.50% to 0.75% on December 14 (U.S. time), the basic interest rate was raised from 0.75% to 1.00% on December 15. The adjustment to the basic interest rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. Under this formula, the basic interest rate is set at the level of either the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average of the 5-day moving average of overnight and 1-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: 2016 Hong Kong Interbank Rate\n\nHong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points saw a significant premium in January, largely following the trend of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, and partially reflecting investors' demand for foreign exchange hedging for their Hong Kong stock portfolios (Figure 4). The forward exchange rate premium began to narrow in February. As market conditions stabilized, Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points remained largely stable from March to November, before rising again in December due to the narrowing of the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong money market operated smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HK$5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the linked exchange rate system (Linked System) has remained the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past several decades. Market volatility intensified in early 2016, sparking renewed discussions about the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and comparisons to the Asian financial crisis period. To enhance public understanding of the Linked System, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) elaborated on its technical details and emphasized Hong Kong's financial system's capacity to withstand shocks. The government reiterated its firm commitment to maintaining the Linked System. Stability in foreign exchange and currency markets further solidified public confidence in the government's resolve to uphold the Linked System and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and preservation. During its annual Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) explicitly stated that the Linked System is the most suitable monetary regime for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and robust and effective financial regulation as the underpinnings of the system.\n\nFigure 4: 2016 USD\/HKD Forward Exchange Rate Points\n\nGiven the critical role of a robust banking system in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests. It also strengthens oversight of banks' personal, corporate, and mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system's ability to withstand shocks. In light of the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, Hong Kong interbank rates have begun to rise, and the HKMA reminds the public to remain vigilant and prepare for potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the currency base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the currency base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 106.7% on December 31, 2016 (Figure 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial fiscal resources provide a strong buffer for Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Changes in the Support Ratio in 2016\n\n# ResearchWork\n\nThe Currency Board, which is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and discussing issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2016, the topics discussed by the Currency Board included the synchronization of Hong Kong's economic growth with that of mainland China and the United States, external demand for Hong Kong dollars, and Hong Kong's financial conditions index. The minutes of the Currency Board meetings and the reports submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on the operation of the currency board system are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Financial Research Centre continues to support research in monetary policy, banking, and the financial sector. In 2016, the research centre invited a total of 18 scholars to visit and published 20 working papers.\n\nWithin the year, the research center organized six international conferences and seminars, primarily including the following:\n- In January, the \"7th China Economic Annual International Symposium\" was held, with the theme \"China's Increasing Influence on the Global Economy.\" During the symposium, eight research papers covering a wide range of topics were presented, including China's growth rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the RMB on the global and regional economies, as well as the trends in interest rate differential trading and information flows between RMB markets.\n- In March, the \"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Keio University, and Research Center Symposium on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics\" was co-organized with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University. The symposium covered multiple economic topics, including global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- In August, the \"Real Estate and Financial Stability Seminar\" was co-organized with the City University of Hong Kong. The papers presented at the seminar covered topics such as age, demographics, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; dynamics of housing prices in Hong Kong; housing affordability; the influence of mortgage regulations on household lifecycle housing decisions; and the residential property market in mainland China.\n- In October, a seminar on the Asia-Pacific economic system was co-organized with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements, with the theme \"Resilience of Regional Economic Systems in a Volatile Global Environment.\" The seminar attracted senior officials from several central banks, leading scholars, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who participated in interactive roundtable discussions on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system, exchanging views. The topics discussed were broad, including financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, the spillover effects of the slowdown in the mainland Chinese economy on other regions within the Asia-Pacific, and the impact on and prospects for potential growth in Asia.\n\nThe Research Center also hosted the \"14th Annual Summer Conference\" in August and the \"14th China Mainland Economic Conference\" in September, discussing the asset quality and financial stability of mainland banks. These conferences attracted participation from the academic community, the financial services sector, and representatives from central banks around the world. During the year, the Research Center also organized 21 public seminars, exploring a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial issues.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes (issued by note-issuing banks) amounted to HKD 407.8 billion, representing an increase of 13.2% compared to the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government was HKD 11.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 9 and 10). Among the government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of HKD 10 circulating banknotes was HKD 4.4 billion, of which 86% were polymer banknotes.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\n\nDespite increased global market risks and volatility, the Hong Kong banking system remained resilient in 2016. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened its regulatory oversight of the risk governance frameworks and effectiveness of credit and liquidity risk management systems of authorized institutions during the year. Given the increasing frequency of cyberattacks, the HKMA also enhanced its regulatory supervision of the cyber risk management practices of authorized institutions. In line with its commitment to combating financial crimes, the effectiveness of authorized institutions' measures to monitor money laundering and terrorist financing remained a key focus of the HKMA's regulatory efforts. Regarding the conduct of authorized institutions, the HKMA took concrete actions to promote a customer-centric corporate culture and advance financial inclusion, while addressing challenges faced by overseas small and medium-sized enterprises and startups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its regulatory oversight of the methods used by authorized institutions to sell investment and insurance products, further enhancing protection for customers.\n\nIn terms of regulatory policies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made significant progress in preparing Hong Kong for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards, including the net stable funding ratio, large exposure limits, IFRS 9, and the resolution framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Regulatory Work Overview\n\nIn 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted 188 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its engagement with the boards of authorized institutions to enhance risk governance and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with boards or board committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors to exchange views on corporate culture and risk governance. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the compensation systems of authorized institutions contribute to effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy levels, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reviews the capital plans of authorized institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, to prepare for the full implementation of Basel III's buffer capital requirements in 2019. Solvency stress tests for authorized institutions have also been improved in line with the current macroeconomic environment. The HKMA also carefully assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides recommendations on areas needing improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site review work, the HKMA continues to conduct thematic assessments in conjunction with regular on-site inspections, with thematic assessments primarily applied to categories assessed as higher risk. This regulatory approach enables the HKMA to more effectively allocate regulatory resources to address emerging and significant risks faced by authorized institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic assessments. The focus of these inspections and assessments remained on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly credit risks related to mainland China business; another key focus area was measures to combat money laundering and the monitoring of terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the frequency of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity risk, operational risk, and technology risk management. During the year, specialized inspection teams conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory activities in 2016.\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nBank loans grew moderately in 2016. The total outstanding loan amount increased by 6.5% for the year, compared to an increase of 3.5% in 2015 (Table 2). Due to the growth rate of customer deposits exceeding that of bank loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total related loans in the mainland increased by 7% to 356.4 billion Hong Kong dollars (HKD) by the end of 2016 (Table 3), which included 54.5 billion HKD in loans accounted for by subsidiaries of banks registered in Hong Kong operating on the mainland.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained robust in 2016. Although the specific category loan ratio for retail banking rose slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained significantly below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the specific category loan ratio for the overall banking sector increased from 0.73% to 0.85%. The asset quality of mainland China-related loans within the banking sector followed a similar trend during the year; meanwhile, the specific category loan ratio for these loans in retail banking rose slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, and the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also increased slightly from 0.77% one year prior to 0.80%.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has allocated significant regulatory resources to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. During the regulatory process, the HKMA has given particular attention to the sustained increase in risk exposure of authorized institutions towards private enterprises in Mainland China, as well as the credit risks arising from investments in debt securities aimed at boosting earnings. Additionally, the HKMA has conducted a special assessment on the credit risk management practices of authorized institutions regarding the distribution of high-risk investment products.\n\n# Real Estate Mortgage Loan\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor the property loan activities of authorized institutions. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015 but rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% for the year. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans decreased from 64% in September 2009, when the HKMA had not yet introduced its first round of countercyclical property loan measures, to 51% by December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio for new residential mortgage loans also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the HKMA first introduced a cap on debt-to-income ratios, to 34% by December 2016 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for New Residential Property Mortgages  \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced a debt-to-income ratio cap before implementing the first round of countercyclical measures for property loans.\n\nUnder the seventh round of countercyclical measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in February 2015, authorized institutions using the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements were required to extend the application of the 15% credit risk weighted floor from new mortgage loans to the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This provision took effect in June 2016.\n\nMore real estate developers are offering mortgages directly to property buyers during the year, with loan-to-value ratios often exceeding the levels permitted under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) prudential requirements for authorized institutions. The HKMA is closely monitoring this development and regularly communicates with authorized institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage risks associated with real estate developers. Additionally, upon request from the HKMA, the Land Registry has agreed to provide an electronic alert service to authorized institutions. Authorized institutions using this service will receive electronic alerts from the Land Registry whenever other mortgage documents for properties they have mortgaged are submitted for registration. This service will help address situations where mortgage borrowers take out additional mortgages on the same property without prior consent from the authorized institution. The Land Registry launched the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Regulation of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nLike other international financial centers, Hong Kong faces an increasing number of cyber threats. In 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) received reports from authorized institutions about unauthorized stock trading activities and attempts to infiltrate their payment systems, and promptly took action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued alerts regarding electronic banking services, reminding the public to be cautious of online stock trading scams and recommending preventive measures. Additionally, the HKMA issued notices to authorized institutions, providing guidance on security measures that could be adopted to further strengthen the monitoring of online banking services. Regarding the cases of attempted infiltration of banking payment systems, the HKMA had already alerted authorized institutions to be vigilant about such scams upon first discovering similar cases in Hong Kong. With the assistance of the police, the HKMA explained the modus operandi of these scams and required authorized institutions to take these methods into account when enhancing monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the banking sector's capability to address cybersecurity risks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the Cybersecurity Initiative in May 2016. This initiative comprises three pillars: the Cybersecurity Assessment Framework, a Professional Training Program, and a Cybersecurity Risk Information-Sharing Platform (see the \"Financial Technology Facilitation Office\" section in the \"Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\" chapter). In December, the HKMA issued a notice to authorized institutions outlining the implementation timeline for the Cybersecurity Assessment Framework.\n\nThe application of fintech in the banking sector made significant progress in 2016, with multiple authorized institutions launching new fintech products. Particularly notable developments were seen in the areas of personal small-value payment services, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication. In September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox,\" allowing authorized institutions to test their fintech initiatives in a controlled environment without fully complying with the HKMA's regulatory requirements. This arrangement enables authorized institutions to collect real-world data and user feedback early on, allowing for necessary adjustments before officially launching fintech services. By the end of 2016, six applications for using the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox had been approved, with the new fintech products involving biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain technology for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also raised the transaction limit for online banking personal small-value payment services that do not require dual authentication to HKD 5,000 per account per day, in response to the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, multiple property-related fraud cases occurred, involving fraudsters impersonating property owners to attempt profiting through mortgage loan applications or selling the properties. Although these fraud cases did not involve authorized institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) still closely collaborated with the police and the Hong Kong Bankers' Association (Banking Association) to provide guidance to authorized institutions on detecting and preventing such fraud cases within the banking industry. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the \"Operational Incident Communications\" to share lessons learned from operational incidents that had occurred at authorized institutions. The HKMA also conducted on-site reviews and special assessments of authorized institutions' business operational risk management systems, fraud management practices, trust\/trustee operations, and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent unauthorized or non-compliant transaction activities.\n\n# Regulation of Capital Market Business and Liquidity Risk\n\nSeveral major political events occurred in 2016, causing the financial markets to experience multiple significant fluctuations throughout the year. Meanwhile, U.S. interest rates continued to gradually normalize, with the Federal Open Market Committee deciding in December to raise the federal funds rate for the second time since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these political events, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to maintain close communication with overseas regulators, assessing the impact of these events on Hong Kong's banking system and urging banks to remain vigilant and enhance their risk management practices to cope with adverse market developments.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducts additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system's ability to withstand potential severe stress scenarios and follows up with authorized institutions to enhance their capacity to respond. Following a round of on-site reviews on interest rate risk management conducted in 2015, the HKMA carried out further on-site reviews to evaluate the market risk management practices of authorized institutions and required those with deficiencies in monitoring to implement corrective actions.\n\n# Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Fundraising Activities\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) risk-based anti-money laundering (AML) supervision includes on-site reviews and off-site reviews (including regulatory contacts with authorized institutions on specific matters), primarily targeting sectors with higher risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. The reviews cover the assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks by authorized institutions, the implementation of the risk-based approach, as well as the systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance.

Last year's tax revisions helped create a favorable environment to attract multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong into an infrastructure financing center and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office within the year. The HKMA issued 13 licenses to issuers of stored-value payment tools during the year. Hong Kong's strong fiscal performance and substantial external net assets continue to be confirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor's maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nAffected by fluctuations in global financial markets and uncertainties regarding the RMB exchange rate outlook, the global offshore RMB business slowed down in 2016. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as the global hub for offshore RMB business, processing approximately seven out of every ten RMB payment transactions worldwide. The launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect mechanism in December marked another milestone in the opening of China's capital account and represented an important step in enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding its support for RMB liquidity in the market and introducing measures to enhance the transparency of RMB market liquidity.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders and positioning Hong Kong as a hub for infrastructure financing. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully drove the passage of legal amendments to eliminate tax asymmetries and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, thereby creating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors operating in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing, with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world's third-largest sovereign fund, announcing in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the only office of the institution outside Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a positive assessment in last year's Fourth Article Consultation regarding our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international financial center. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participated in international discussions, striving to advance global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, and these efforts contributed to the confirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by the major credit rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe and effective operation and sustained development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure play a crucial role in consolidating Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center and a global offshore RMB business hub. The four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and the central clearing system for debt instruments (CMU system), which handle interbank transactions, achieved 100% system availability in 2016, surpassing the target level of 99.95%.\n\nIn 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority further strengthened Hong Kong's retail payment financial infrastructure. During the year, a total of 13 licenses for stored value payment tools were issued under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, which came into full effect in November 2016. The scope of electronic cheque services has also been expanded to include cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of fintech in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Promotion Office in March. Several key initiatives implemented this year have made satisfactory progress.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced a series of measures to strengthen the banking sector's soft power, including (i) launching an Enhancing Directors' Professional Competence Program; (ii) establishing a professional qualification framework for banking staff across the industry; and (iii) implementing a consumer education program.\n\n# 2016 Year in Review\n\n# Offshore RMB Business\n\nGlobal financial market volatility in 2016 and uncertainty regarding the RMB exchange rate outlook led to a slowdown in global offshore RMB business. As of the end of the year, the combined balance of RMB deposits and deposit certificates held by Hong Kong customers totaled 625.1 billion RMB, representing a 38% decrease compared to the previous year (Figure 1). Offshore RMB bond issuance during the year fell to 52.8 billion RMB, while the volume of RMB trade settlements processed by Hong Kong banks also declined to 454.21 billion RMB. On the other hand, the outstanding balance of RMB loans held by Hong Kong banks at year-end remained similar to the previous year at 294.8 billion RMB (Figure 2). Transaction volumes on the RMB RTGS system remained high, with an average daily transaction value of 863.6 billion RMB in 2016. As can be seen, despite a reduction in the RMB pool, Hong Kong continues to support substantial RMB financial intermediation activities. According to SWIFT statistics, Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of RMB payment transactions in 2016, demonstrating its status as the global hub for offshore RMB business.\n\nFigure 1: Renminbi Customer Deposits and Time Deposit Certificates\n\nFigure 2: Renminbi Financing Activities\n\nDuring the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) closely collaborated with mainland authorities to secure greater policy space for advancing the RMB business in Hong Kong. Several new measures were launched during the year, including further expanding access to the mainland's interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, as well as introducing the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" in December. In response to the growing demand for liquidity management in cross-border investment channels and markets, the HKMA expanded its RMB liquidity arrangements. In October, the number of primary liquidity providers under the program was increased from seven to nine, and the total quota of the program was raised from 14 billion RMB to 18 billion RMB. The HKMA also enhanced the transparency of its RMB liquidity arrangements, helping participating banks more effectively manage their liquidity needs.\n\nThe national \"13th Five-Year\" Plan announced in March reaffirms Hong Kong's status as a global offshore RMB business hub, demonstrating the central government's support for further development of offshore RMB operations in Hong Kong.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore RMB business. The HKMA is also actively participating in various events to promote Hong Kong's role as a global offshore RMB business hub and a key springboard for China's \"going out\" strategy, including participating in local events organized by industry groups and private institutions, as well as overseas events in mainland China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Arrangement Between the Mainland and Hong Kong on the Establishment of Closer Economic and Trade Relations\n\nUnder the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between the Mainland and Hong Kong, a new agreement to basically achieve service trade liberalization between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the current arrangement and collaborates with government authorities to explore further expanding market access for Hong Kong's financial sector and facilitating measures.\n\n# Office for Promoting Infrastructure Financing (IFFO)\n\n# IFFO's Mission\n\nIFFO's mission is to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO's functions include:  \n- Providing a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;  \n- Enhancing skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;  \n- Promoting market and product development;  \n- And facilitating infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lam, President of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (7th from the left), raised a toast together with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the IFFO in July, with a mission to promote infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public sector investors, private sector investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project developers and operators, professional service firms, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made significant progress since its establishment. To enhance skills, IFFO, in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) under the World Bank Group and PAG, organized an executive workshop in October with the theme \"Private Capital Participation in Investment and Financing of Infrastructure Projects in Emerging Markets.\" The workshop received very positive feedback from participants, helping to enhance knowledge and facilitate networking. In November, IFFO hosted an executive seminar, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to share his experience in planning, operation, and management of infrastructure projects. In July, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Center to establish a framework for cooperation. Additionally, in December, IFFO signed MOUs with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, facilitating infrastructure project financing for these two banks through the IFFO platform. These activities have helped strengthen Hong Kong's position as a hub for infrastructure financing and enhance its international profile.\n\nMr. Tuen Mun Lam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (front left), and Mr. Philip Le Roux, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the International Finance Corporation (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate cooperation in utilizing the IFFO platform, creating a more efficient and favorable market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nMr. Tuen Mun Lam, Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (front left), and Mr. Chris Heathcote, CEO of the Global Infrastructure Center (front right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework and promote financing for infrastructure projects.\n\nMr. Chan Tak-lam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (left), and Mr. Hu Huai-bang, Chairman of the China Development Bank, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Enterprise Treasury Center\n\nTo further attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with the government to create a favorable tax environment for such centers. Specifically, the Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016, passed in June, allows companies to deduct interest expenses incurred in operating internal financing activities within their group when calculating profits tax, provided they meet specified conditions. Additionally, it provides a 50% concession on profits tax (reducing the effective rate to 8.25%) for profits derived from specified treasury activities of eligible corporate treasury centers. Table 2 summarizes key points of the Ordinance:\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is actively promoting the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong to multinational and mainland Chinese enterprises. By year-end, the HKMA had engaged with nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organizations. In November, the HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong China Enterprise Association to assist Hong Kong's Chinese enterprises in better understanding and utilizing the HKMA's corporate treasury center platform.\n\n# Promote asset management services\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote Hong Kong as a global asset management center. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management reached 1,300 by the end of 2016, representing an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. According to the Asia Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity firms operating in Hong Kong (including both SFC-licensed entities and non-SFC-licensed entities) also rose by 4.6% in 2016, reaching 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world's top 100 asset management companies, as well as most of China's top 20 mutual fund companies, have established operations or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with operations based in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world's third-largest sovereign fund, which announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong—the only office outside of Abu Dhabi set up by the institution.\n\n# Introducing an Open-Ended Mutual Fund Corporate Structure\n\nTo attract fund registrations in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with the government and industry to foster a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the 2016 Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill was passed, introducing an open-ended fund company structure. This diversifies Hong Kong's fund registration platform and creates a more flexible operating environment for fund managers, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international asset management center.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to enhance market awareness and understanding of Islamic finance, including collaborating with industry associations to organize and participate in Islamic finance seminars and lectures, as well as sharing experiences on issuing Islamic bonds with market participants and encouraging them to utilize Hong Kong's platform. Following the successful issuance of the previous two batches of Islamic bonds, the HKMA has maintained close collaboration with the government to launch the third batch when market conditions are favorable.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2016年）\n\n1. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。\n2. 綜合消費物價指數以2014\/2015年為基期的數列計算。\n\n表2 外匯基金投資回報率：以港元計\n\n1. 2001至2003年的投資回報率以美元計。2. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。3. 不同年期的平均數以複合年度方式計算。\n\n表3 外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重（包括遠期交易）\n","en":"# Reserve Management\n\n2016 was a year filled with surprises and black swan events, as global financial markets experienced significant volatility and turbulence. Early in the year, market concerns over a hard landing for the mainland economy and a slowdown in global growth led to a sharp decline in global stock markets. The June Brexit referendum in the UK and the November US election results also came as surprises. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years to enhance the resilience of the Foreign Exchange Fund. As a result, the Foreign Exchange Fund still recorded an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, thereby preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary and is invested in securities or other assets that the Financial Secretary deems appropriate after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Management of Foreign Exchange Funds\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) To safeguard capital;\n(b) To ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;\n(c) To ensure that liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Subject to compliance with the above (a) to (c), to maximize investment returns in order to safeguard the fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe aforementioned objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the foreign exchange fund and have been reflected in the fund's portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund is primarily divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full support for the currency base in accordance with the rules of the Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries to safeguard the value and long-term purchasing power of assets. The long-term target allocation ratio for bonds and stocks across these two portfolios is 71 to 29. In terms of target currency composition, 91% of assets are allocated to U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance medium-to-long term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has cautiously and gradually diversified part of the Exchange Fund's assets into a broader range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas real estate investments. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap of the long-term growth portfolio is set at one-third of the Exchange Fund's cumulative surplus; however, there is room for this cap to increase as part of future fund allocations into long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for the Exchange Fund's account for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the investment performance evaluation of the Exchange Fund does not include it.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for Future Fund deposits. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the proportion of the portfolios. By the end of 2016, the Future Fund accounted for 80% of the investment portfolio and 20% of the long-term growth portfolio. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the distribution outlined in the investment benchmarks, indicates the optimal long-term asset distribution that the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide to implement tactical asset allocation in order to seek returns that exceed the benchmark. As a result, the actual distribution often deviates from the benchmark distribution (i.e., the strategic distribution), and the difference between the actual and benchmark distributions is referred to as \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmarks and the limits for tactical deviation after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation. Portfolio managers can select holdings within the limits of tactical deviation to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nStaff of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Reserve Management Department directly manage approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio is invested in global fixed-income markets and executes the Exchange Fund's macro risk management strategies through derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 26% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of engaging external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for the Exchange Fund's investments, enable the Fund to benefit from diversified investment strategies, and allow internal professionals to gain market insights and knowledge.\n\nThe expenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supports the \"Principles of Responsible Ownership\" issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on March 7, 2016. These Principles are voluntary and aim to help investors determine how best to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In the context of managing the foreign exchange fund, the HKMA encourages external fund managers appointed to manage Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles when managing these investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, highlighting the importance of risk management. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. Additionally, the HKMA employs risk management tools to assess market risks under both normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts a detailed analysis of investment performance factors to most effectively leverage the investment management expertise of both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# 2016 Financial Market\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced significant fluctuations and turbulence. In January, market concerns over a hard landing in the Chinese economy and a slowdown in global growth led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, which stabilized by mid-February. June's Brexit referendum and November's U.S. election results both came as surprises, but stock markets quickly recovered after brief declines. Overall for the year, global stock markets generally performed well.\n\nIn the bond market, further declines in commodity prices in the first quarter deepened concerns over a slowdown in global growth and low inflation. Combined with uncertainties arising from the UK's Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations that central banks would maintain accommodative policies, these factors increased demand for safe assets, supporting strong performance in government bonds during the first half of 2016. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell to a historical low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, rising market expectations of US interest rate hikes, particularly after the US presidential election, caused US Treasury bond yields to surge. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, but by smaller margins.\n\nIn the currency market, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the dollar exchange rate index reaching a 14-year high. The sustained strength of the dollar was supported by widening interest rate differentials between the dollar and other major currencies. Although the Japanese yen rose by about 3% against the dollar, the euro fell by approximately 3% against the dollar. Amid ongoing uncertainty stemming from the UK Brexit referendum results, the British pound also declined by 16% against the dollar during the year, marking the largest decline since 2008.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1 2016 Market Returns\nStock market performance is calculated based on changes in the index price during the year.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant fluctuations in financial markets, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 68.1 billion in 2016, comprising HKD 28.6 billion in overseas stock gains, HKD 5.3 billion in Hong Kong stock gains, HKD 33.1 billion in bond gains, HKD 16.9 billion in gains from other investments held by subsidiary companies of the Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Holdings, and a HKD 15.8 billion decrease in foreign exchange valuation adjustments for non-HKD assets. This decrease was inevitable due to the sharp rise in the dollar exchange rate last year, which caused the Foreign Exchange Fund's non-dollar investments to incur foreign exchange valuation adjustments when converted into HKD. Meanwhile, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 700 million.\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total assets of the Foreign Exchange Fund amounted to 3.6187 trillion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of the Long-term Growth Portfolio investments was 181.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, including 116.8 billion Hong Kong dollars in private equity and 65 billion Hong Kong dollars in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment was 133.8 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges in the investment environment, the foreign exchange fund still achieved a 2% investment return in 2016 (excluding the strategic asset portfolio). The long-term growth portfolio has generated an annualized internal rate of return of approximately 12% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\nDue to the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a series of defensive measures over the past few years, including shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and substantially reducing positions in non-dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated our efforts to diversify investments, particularly in long-term growth portfolios. These measures have significantly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund against shocks.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Foreign Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 displays the investment return rate of the Foreign Exchange Fund in 2016, as well as the average investment return rates for different periods. The Foreign Exchange Fund's average return rates were 0.9% over the past 3 years, 2.0% over the past 5 years, 2.6% over the past 10 years, and 4.8% since 1994.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","en":"# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Report by the Director of the Audit Office\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit and Finance Office\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") listed on pages 149 to 237, which include the Exchange Fund and the Group's balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements fairly and accurately reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of an Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report titled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in Relation to the Audit of the Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required by those standards. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, based on my professional judgment, were most significant in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I addressed these matters when auditing the overall financial statements and forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Report of the Director of the Audit Office (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow should I handle the relevant matters in an audit?\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value totaled 31,989.75 billion HKD, and financial liabilities totaled 9,639.77 billion HKD.\n\nThe fair value of 95% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities is the quoted price of the same asset or liability in an active market (Level 1 parameters), or estimated using valuation methods with parameters based on observable market data (Level 2 parameters).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The related financial assets amount to HKD 175.886 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the large amounts involved and the involvement of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for valuing financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation processes for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring controls;\n- Evaluating and testing monitoring controls, including application controls related to computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;\n- If market quotes are used, verifying the prices against independent sources;\n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the parameters against independent sources; and\n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Future Fund Deposit\n\nPlease refer to the notes to the financial statements 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28.\n\nIn previous years, the majority of deposits in fiscal reserves had to be repaid upon request, with interest calculated at a fixed interest rate determined annually based on the historical returns of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe government established the Future Fund within the fiscal reserves on January 1, 2016. The initial funding of the Future Fund includes the first tranche from the Land Fund surplus (amounting to HK$2,197.3 billion) and regular contributions from the general revenue account, the amount of which is determined by the Financial Secretary. The interest on the Future Fund deposits is calculated based on a composite interest rate, which is determined annually on a weighted average basis, referencing a fixed interest rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio mentioned above, as well as the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and real estate investments). Unless otherwise instructed by the Financial Secretary, the deposits in the Future Fund, along with the interest earned, should be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Future Fund had deposits totaling 224.53 billion Hong Kong dollars. The accumulated interest on these deposits amounted to 10.071 billion Hong Kong dollars. Due to the large amounts involved and significant changes in deposit conditions, particular attention is required in the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of the deposits and the interest earned.\n\nThe audit procedures for future fund deposits include:\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used to measure the deposits and the interest earned thereon;\n- Examining the methodology for calculating the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculations of the fixed interest rate determined based on the historical performance of the reference portfolio, the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio, and the composite interest rate derived from these two rates;\n- Verifying the accrued interest amount calculated using the composite interest rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation and disclosure of the deposits and the interest earned thereon in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.12, 17, and 18 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value and amounted to HKD 22.723 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in 3 jointly controlled entities and 14 joint ventures, whose primary business is holding overseas investment properties, with the related interests valued at HKD 32.083 billion. Regardless of whether the investment properties are directly held by the Group or held through jointly controlled entities or joint ventures, their fair values are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:  \n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties held directly by the Group or by jointly controlled entities or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Data\n\nThe Financial Services Commissioner is responsible for other information, which includes all the information in the Financial Services Authority's 2016 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not express any form of attestation conclusion on other information.\n\nWith respect to the audit of financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other information and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with information obtained during the audit, or whether it appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report this fact. In this regard, I have no such reports.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Secretary and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding financial statements\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and in compliance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that they consider necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial manager must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and where applicable, disclose matters related to continuing as a going concern, using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# Responsibilities of Auditors in the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements as a whole contain no material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it cannot guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. Misstatements may result from fraud or error, and they are considered material if it is reasonably expected that they individually or in aggregate could influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements arising from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Management Officer are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Financial Management Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the audit committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope, timing, and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit period.\n"}
