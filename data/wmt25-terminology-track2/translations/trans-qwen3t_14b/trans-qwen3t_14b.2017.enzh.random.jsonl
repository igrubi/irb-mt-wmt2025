{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong

首席執行官的聲明\n\n2017年，全球經濟和金融市場表現得比預期更理想：實體經濟見到穩定增長；通貨膨脹仍然處於低水平；美國聯邦儲備委員會當年實施的三次加息及縮減資產負債表的措施，並未造成新興市場經濟體資金外流或美元強勢。在牛氣沖天的氛圍下，全球股市，包括三大美國股市指數，持續創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數急升34%。恒生指數在2017年錄得近8,000點（或36%）的升幅，並突破30,000點關口，於2018年1月創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境中充滿樂觀情緒，甚至過度樂觀。然而，這種情況持續到今年2月初，當時最新數據顯示美國工資上漲幅度高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市的顯著調整。道瓊斯指數在2月第二周的兩天內下跌超過1,000點，而恒生指數在同周內下跌超過3,000點。美國10年期國債收益率飆升至高達2.95%。資金流動的迅速逆轉表明，市場估值創歷史新高並非建立在紥實的根基之上。這也提醒我們，香港需要一個穩健且強大的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動和資金外流帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 銀行系統的韌性因防患未然措施而增強\n\n俗話說，「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局於2017年實施進一步的風險緩衝措施，以保障香港銀行及金融系統的穩定。5月，我們推出了第八輪逆週期措施，針對銀行的按揭貸款，並加強銀行對向地產商發放貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在加強銀行體系對來自樓市任何逆轉所引起衝擊的韌性。隨著多個輪次的措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與樓價比率由2009年9月的64%跌至2017年底的49%，而平均還款比率亦由2010年8月的41%下降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被視為「規模太大而無法倒閉」的不可持續金融機構。這將幫助避免重蹈2008年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時動用公帑拯救面臨倒閉的金融機構，並減低這些機構結業對金融體系、經濟及整體社會的影響。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩定和可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足率遠高於適用的法定要求，並位居全球最高之列。這無疑顯示香港銀行體系具有新高的韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款額增加16%，同時資產質量亦保持良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年的0.72%跌至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均2.2%。銀行業整體股東權益回報率（根據稅前營運利潤計算）在2017年達11.74%，相比其他國際金融中心，是一個非常健康水平。\n\n# 穩健的銀行業是長期財務穩定性的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機暴露了單憑規則和法規來限制金融業追求利潤而不顧其主要責任的局限。鑑於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）近年來加強推廣「穩健銀行」實踐，鼓勵銀行發展和追求良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是，為解決銀行員工追求短期利潤而損害客戶或銀行長期利益的問題，我們正在鼓勵銀行建立符合其企業文化和價值觀的適當激勵機制。作為此計劃的一部分，我們於2017年3月安排舉辦首屆獨立非執行董事（INEDs）年度會議，以突顯建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並幫助INEDs更有效地發揮其監督和監測職能。\n\n在銀行業的支持下，2017年香港金融管理局（HKMA）在推動金融包容方面取得成功。6間實體銀行分行及3間流動分行開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與EPS及一間便利商店連鎖機構合作，開展試驗計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的商店提款，無需進行購物。香港郵政亦於今年推出長者在七間郵局提款服務，主要設於離島及新界地區。在開戶方面，HKMA去年設立專頁及電郵賬戶，並設有專責團隊跟進公眾查詢或與開設銀行賬戶相關的投訴。經多方努力，個人及企業銀行賬戶開設的客戶體驗已取得顯著改善。\n\n#金融科技是銀行業的遊戲規則改變者\n\n在科技快速發展的新紀元，金融科技已逐步融入我們的日常生活。在這個持續變化的科技環境中，銀行必須把握新發展，並在金融科技的應用中追求創新。隨著智慧銀行新紀元的到來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於9月推出了七項措施（詳見第106頁），推動銀行業採用金融科技，以提升銀行產品與服務的品質，更好地服務顧客。雖然這些措施彼此獨立，但具有互補性，將成為香港支付與銀行服務未來生態的重大改變。顧客不僅能享受更方便、快捷且安全的支付與銀行服務，還將擁有更多選擇，並對財務交易擁有更大控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來商業成功的關鍵，而邁入智慧銀行新紀元將為銀行帶來重大升級與轉型的機會。\n\n#由一帶一路及粵港澳大灣區締造的龐大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭變得更加激烈，多元化金融產業對香港至關重要。2017年，香港金管局加強了其提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。鑑於香港擁有「背靠內地而保持國際視野」的無與倫比的優勢，「一帶一路」倡議及粵港澳大灣區的發展將為金融和銀行業帶來龐大的機遇，並為香港經濟增長帶來新的動力。為響應「一帶一路」倡議而設立的香港金管局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自推出以來其合作夥伴數目增至約90家，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資融資中心打下紥實基礎。2017年中國開發銀行在香港發行首隻「一帶一路」債券，凸顯香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資中所發揮的樞紐地位。\n\n此外，除了基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極參與香港作為企業財務中心、私募基金及亞洲衍生產品業務中心的發展，透過吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在該城市管理其資金、資產及多個財務風險。這些措施將進一步鞏固和升級香港的金融及相關專業服務範疇。香港金融管理局亦與負責粵港澳大灣區發展的有關當局維持緊密溝通，以鞏固合作，從而推動該地區作為世界級城市群的金融發展。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直以「善用香港優勢，滿足國家所需」為主軸持續發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年7月推出債券通北向交易後，內地與其他地區通過香港金融平台的互聯互通市場已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯了香港作為金融中介的獨特地位，促進全球投資者進入內地金融市場。2017年，香港維持其作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的領先地位。人民幣實時全額清算系統的日均交易額高達9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計數據，當年全球人民幣支付交易中超過70%經香港處理。離岸人民幣市場繼續有序運作並穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才以鞏固銀行業的軟實力\n\n鑑於金融業持續增長，培育人才對其實現可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局（HKMA）注重銀行業軟實力的建設，並持續鼓勵和支持銀行從業員的能力建設。繼在提升能力框架下推出兩項專業資歷，涵蓋反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資及網絡安全後，HKMA 於去年擴展其覆蓋範圍，加入零售財富管理及財務管理，以通過持續專業發展提升銀行從業員的核心能力。HKMA 亦致力於培育銀行業的年青人才。2017 年，我們與業界合作推出了私人財富管理試點學徒計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。鑑於獲得龐大的呼應，這些計劃將於未來進一步擴展其覆蓋範圍。\n\n# 穩健的投資策略在中長期取得合理且平穩的回報\n\n背靠強勁的全球經濟增長，香港儲備基金去年取得創下新高的投資收入2,640億港元，各類資產均錄得回報，包括股權、債券及外匯。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合取得12.1%的回報率，而儲備組合則錄得1.8%的回報率。長期增長組合（LTGP）自2009年成立以來的年化內部回報率達至13.7%。雖然去年投資表現佳績，但日益複雜的投資環境需要香港金融管理局繼續謹慎管理儲備基金。我們將維持機動靈活的姿態，密切監察市場發展，並在適當時候部署防禦措施。LTGP下的投資亦將進一步擴展。一如以往，管理香港市民財富時，將秉承「資本保值為先，長期增長為後」的投資原則，並在可控風險水平內進行。\n\n全球實體經濟延續去年的升勢，但2018年不明朗因素和風險仍潛藏。這些包括一旦通脹上揚，美國加息的加快步伐，激化的貿易摩擦，以及惡化的地緣政治生態。一旦這些下行風險觸發，將對全球金融市場造成顯著且廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格和實體經濟產生連鎖影響。因此，我們應該謹慎管理風險。\n\n未來幾個月，相信香港美元利率走勢將維持在焦點上。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備委員會已提升利率6次。隨著香港美元利率與其美元對應利率之間息差擴闊，資金從香港美元流向美元的動機變得更大。近期香港美元持續承受走弱壓力，且7.85弱方兌換承擔（CU）已被觸發。正如我們多次強調，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，香港金管局將扮演「超級兌換商」的角色，在市場上購買香港美元並出售美元，以保證香港美元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。此類操作屬正常，亦符合聯匯制度的設計。這不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，香港外匯基金現時持有的資產超過4兆港元，其中香港美元貨幣基礎約為1.7兆港元，為資金外流情況提供強大緩衝。多年來，香港金管局已建立多個防線，以保障銀行及金融系統的穩定。從正面來看，資金外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，這有助於香港利率環境的正常化，進而促進本地經濟及資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，香港金管局將嚴陣以待，並竭盡全力維持香港的貨幣及銀行體系穩定。\n"}

Nevertheless, the public remains highly confident in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe money markets continue to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"city":["城市"],"end":["年底"],"people":["市民"],"built":["建立"],"expanded":["擴展"],"achieving":["取得"],"continuing":["持續"],"pursue":["追求"],"us":["我們"],"saw":["見到"],"abound":["潛藏"],"record":["紀錄"],"remained":["仍然"],"since":["自"],"HK":["香港"],"49":["49%"],"launch":["推出"],"first":["首"],"adoption":["採用"],"webpage":["專頁"],"year":["年"],"increasing":["增加"],"facilitating":["促進"],"billion":["億"],"’":["的"],"lives":["生活"],"great":["重大"],"marks":["適逢"],"competence":["能力"],"developments":["發展"],"reversal":["逆轉"],"indicated":["顯示"],"Thanks":["經"],"brought":["帶來"],"secure":["安全"],"introduction":["推出"],"classified":["不良"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"developers":["地產商"],"2014":["2014年"],"transform":["轉型"],"developing":["開展"],"widening":["擴闊"],"strengthen":["鞏固"],"operate":["運作"],"campaign":["計劃"],"upgrade":["升級"],"maintained":["維持"],"technological":["科技"],"hence":["因而"],"2008":["2008年"],"highlight":["突顯"],"era":["新紀元"],"among":["位居…前列"],"role":["地位"],"41":["41%"],"weathered":["克服"],"addition":["此外"],"fell":["跌"],"pursuing":["追求"],"enhancing":["加強"],"coming":["未來"],"launched":["推出"],"times":["次"],"stepped":["加強"],"efforts":["努力"],"February":["2月"],"1.8":["1.8%"],"concerted":["多方"],"established":["設立"],"11.74":["11.74%"],"together":["一同"],"ensure":["保證"],"result":["造成"],"weaken":["走弱"],"responsibilities":["責任"],"play":["發揮"],"modules":["專業資歷"],"RMB900":["9,000億元人民幣"],"2010":["2010年"],"practitioners":["從業員"],"second":["第二"],"involved":["參與"],"closures":["結業"],"integrated":["融入"],"implement":["落實"],"moving":["邁進"],"make":["讓"],"give":["帶來"],"part":["部分"],"convenient":["方便"],"case":["一旦"],"dropped":["下跌"],"also":["亦"],"gained":["錄得"],"May":["5月"],"always":["一向"],"vigilant":["嚴陣以待"],"created":["締造"],"undoubtedly":["顯示"],"light":["情況下"],"round":["輪"],"needs":["所需"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"sustainable":["可持續"],"competition":["競爭"],"2.2":["2.2%"],"increase":["上升"],"7.85":["7.85"],"foundation":["根基"],"accounts":["賬戶"],"revealed":["暴露"],"quarter":["四分之一"],"smoothly":["有序"],"maintain":["保持"],"perform":["發揮"],"recurrence":["重蹈"],"week":["同周"],"3,000":["3,000"],"set":["設立"],"dollars":["美元"],"several":["多個"],"last":["去年"],"including":["包括"],"shocks":["衝擊"],"high":["新高"],"pace":["步伐"],"world":["全球"],"within":["內"],"response":["呼應"],"stated":["強調"],"century":["世紀"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"significant":["顯著"],"adhered":["秉承"],"25th":["25周年"],"satisfactory":["佳績"],"changing":["變"],"extending":["延續"],"Given":["鑑於"],"page":["專頁"],"close":["緊密"],"greater":["更大"],"September":["9月"],"ever":["以來"],"held":["舉辦"],"introduced":["推出"],"coverage":["覆蓋"],"need":["需求"],"Six":["6"],"develop":["發展"],"include":["包括"],"triggered":["觸發"],"manage":["管理"],"25":["25"],"restrain":["制約"],"wage":["工資"],"leveraging":["善用"],"eighth":["第八輪"],"improvement":["改善"],"all-time":["歷史"],"consolidate":["鞏固"],"Enormous":["龐大"],"highlighted":["突顯"],"stood":["高達"],"importance":["重要性"],"agile":["機動"],"responsible":["肩負"],"pivotal":["樞紐"],"reached":["達"],"allowing":["讓"],"good":["好"],"independent":["獨立"],"highs":["新高"],"0.72":["0.72%"],"put":["將"],"0.54":["0.54%"],"advantage":["優勢"],"spotlight":["焦點"],"prevent":["避免"],"around":["約"],"dialogue":["溝通"],"used":["動用"],"cure":["治療"],"safeguard":["保障"],"appropriate":["適當"],"months":["月"],"prompting":["促使"],"particular":["特別"],"advancement":["推動"],"providing":["提供"],"highest":["最高"],"saying":["有云"],"without":["未有"],"nimble":["機動"],"store":["便利店"],"achieved":["取得"],"oversight":["監督"],"corrections":["調整"],"implications":["影響"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"effort":["努力"],"meet":["應對"],"maintaining":["維持"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"continued":["繼續"],"position":["地位"],"minimise":["減低"],"35":["35%"],"expense":["損害"],"empower":["幫助"],"worked":["合作"],"years":["年"],"2018":["2018年"],"closely":["密切"],"issuance":["發行"],"establishing":["樹立"],"long":["長期"],"diversified":["多元化"],"underscores":["突顯"],"landscape":["生態"],"healthy":["健康"],"promoting":["推動"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"easily":["不易"],"solid":["紥實"],"ongoing":["持續"],"task":["任務"],"efficient":["快捷"],"recently":["近期"],"gradual":["逐步"],"back":["背靠"],"positive":["正面"],"fail":["倒"],"perspective":["來看"],"106":["106頁"],"laying":["打下"],"advisable":["應該"],"various":["多個"],"innovation":["創新"],"follow":["跟進"],"attaches":["注重"],"widespread":["廣泛"],"Many":["許多"],"downside":["下行"],"relying":["依靠"],"T.L":["T.L."],"hikes":["加息"],"status":["地位"],"264":["2,640億"],"inaugural":["首屆"],"offer":["帶來"],"bullish":["牛氣沖天"],"next":["之後"],"reappraise":["重新評估"],"society":["社會"],"continue":["繼續"],"outlying":["離島"],"taking":["採取"],"roles":["角色"],"strengthened":["加強"],"areas":["地區"],"one":["一"],"nurturing":["培育"],"Indeed":["事實上"],"levels":["水平"],"enhance":["提升"],"worst":["最壞"],"actively":["積極"],"successful":["成功"],"line":["主軸"],"convenience":["便利"],"normal":["正常"],"trillion":["兆"],"deteriorating":["惡化"],"movements":["走勢"],"currently":["現時"],"impetus":["動力"],"pressure":["壓力"],"8,000":["8,000"],"launching":["開展"],"supporting":["支持"],"arranged":["安排"],"gains":["回報"],"Supporting":["支持(組合)"],"1.7":["1,700億"],"reduction":["縮減"],"Regarding":[

2017年摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在同步擴張的全球經濟推動下加快步伐增長。本地股市上升，住宅物業市場則維持其升勢，而樓宇負擔能力進一步收緊。\n\n香港銀行業維持安全穩健，擁有強大的資本和流動性頭寸，以及健康的資產質素。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n由於兩種貨幣之間的負利率息差擴闊，香港美元對美元回軟。然而，公眾對聯匯制度維持高度信心。\n\n貨幣市場繼續有序運作，並擁有充裕的銀行間流動性。香港的基準利率總計上調75個基點，至1.75厘，因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍的上升。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局是其監管重點，包括信貸、流動性及科技風險管理。香港金融管理局推出第八輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，以鞏固銀行業在樓市任何逆轉情況下的韌性。\n\n在政策方面，國際監管標準的本地落實已取得重大進展。解決機制已生效，為銀行體系穩定建立新的防線。解決辦公室已設立，作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）努力使解決機制在香港銀行業界運作的一部分。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n推出七項新措施，把握由銀行業與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇，並推動香港成為亞洲的金融科技中心。經一系列有關網絡建設及能力建設的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升。\n\n香港維持其在離岸人民幣業務中的領先地位。債券通的推出鞏固了香港作為內地機遇主要門戶的地位。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n受惠於有利的投資環境，香港儲備基金達到2,640億港元的投資收入，創下新高紀錄，為7.4%的投資回報率。\n\n投資多元化之努力持續進行，特別是透過長期成長組合（LTGP）。LTGP 自 2009 年成立以來，年化內部回報率為 13.7%。\n\n#企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續加強企業管治，透過支持員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律及加強資訊科技安全，以應付因新措施落實及工作日益繁重所引起的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally

經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港於2017年見到經濟增長加快、勞動市場狀況更緊縮以及通脹壓力較為溫和。預計2018年的經濟增長將維持紥實。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n在全球經濟更同步擴張的背景下，香港經濟於2017年增長加快。實質本地生產總值（GDP）增長上升至3.8%，遠高於2016年2.1%的增長及過去10年約3%的長期增長（圖1及表1）。本地需求穩步上升，私人消費增長加快，整體投資開支回升。更強勁的本地需求反映有利的就業及收入狀況、資產價格上漲及企業營商氣氛改善。外圍方面，香港貨物出口因全球貿易流量增加而加快步伐，服務出口則因貿易及貨運流量暢旺及入境旅遊改善而復甦。貨物進口在出口帶動的需求下錄得更強勁增長，服務進口則在本地居民強勁的旅遊需求下穩定上升。從淨額計算，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長作出負面貢獻。\n\n\n#貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，港元兌美元匯率一般因港元與美元之間的負利率差異，主要由利率套利活動推動而回軟。這反映了聯匯制度按照其設計的正常運作。儘管港元銀行間利率仍處於相對低位，但由於與新股發行相關的資金需求及銀行年底流動性需求，該利率在2017年底面臨更大升勢壓力。就信貸增長而言，在經歷兩年個位數增長後，2017年總銀行貸款以顯著加快的16.1%速度增長，反映經濟狀況改善及金融市場正面情緒。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸審批標準並未出現放鬆跡象，整體貸款質量仍然良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在2017年全年仍然良好控制（圖2）。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，核心通脹率下降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%為低。特別是物價指數中的房屋組成項目升幅放緩，反映2016年私人住宅新簽訂租賃價格增幅放緩的滲透效果。大致而言，在強勁的產出增長下，名義工資及收入較溫和的上升有助於遏抑本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦屬溫和，與香港主要進口來源地低通脹情況一致，儘管美元較弱。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年勞動市場在高於趨勢的經濟增長下收緊。經過季節調整的失業率從2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，這是近20年來首次低於3%（圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門各自錄得失業率下降，其中零售、融資及專業和商業服務部門的下降幅度更為明顯。隨著總體就業增長加快，以及私人部門職位空缺增加，整體勞動需求繼續鞏固。勞動力也擴展，部分反映年齡較大員工（55歲及以上）參與度提高。在更緊縮的勞動市場條件和較低通脹下，實際工資和收入見到加快增加。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市在2017年幾乎沒有中斷地上漲。恆生指數上升36%，為自2010年以來的最大年度漲幅（圖4）。這波漲勢反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並部分受益於內地投資者通過滬港通帶來的重大資金流入。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底仍處於高水準。平均每日成交額從前一年的港幣669億擴展至港幣883億，而本地市場籌集的總股票資金也上升至港幣5814億，與一年前的港幣4901億相比。\n\n# 房地产市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持升勢（圖4）。交易量由去年的54,701宗擴展至61,591宗，樓價在2017年上升14.8%。房屋負擔能力進一步收緊，樓價與收入比率達16.4，高於1997年的前一高峰，而收入負擔比率則為74.1，遠高於其長期平均水平。鑒於樓價上漲及銀行間按揭業務競爭越趨激烈，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於5月推出第八輪審慎措施，以鞏固銀行風險管理並保障銀行體系穩定。在這些措施實施後，樓價增長短暫放緩，但於第四季加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，交易活動全年顯著上升，交易額及成交量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報率較去年同期微升。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2018年的經濟增長將維持紥實。政府預測增長範圍為3至4%，而私人機構分析師則預計經濟將以平均3.2%的速度擴大。外圍方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受惠於全球增長前景的提升以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦。在本地方面，私人消費增長預計將維持，主要歸因於有利的勞動市場狀況。至於固定資本形成，建築活動應會在住房供應上升及持續的基礎設施項目的推動下穩步推進。雖然改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本支出，但阻力可能來自利率的潛在上升。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在仍然溫和的全球通脹及本地成本穩定上升的背景下，香港的通脹壓力預計在2018年將維持溫和，但通脹率可能從2017年的低點逐步回升。例如，通脹中的租金組成項目可能因新簽訂私人住宅租賃的上漲而帶動，在2018年下半年增強動力。市場共識預計2018年的整體通脹率將維持在仍然溫和的2.2%，而政府預測核心通脹率將為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築工程活動的擴大以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦，預計將在未來一段時間內使勞動市場保持偏緊。私人機構分析師預測2018年的失業率將維持約3.0%。\n\n# 不明朗因素和風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景在數字的不確定因素和風險的影響下，包括與主要央行貨幣政策正常化及全球金融市場穩定性相關的風險，以及升溫的保護主義情緒和惡化的地緣政治緊張局勢。特別是，如果這些風險觸發香港資金流動的逆轉，本地貨幣條件可能比預期更快收緊，構成對實體經濟和資產價格的下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的前景仍然不明朗。在短期內，現時有利的本地經濟狀況、被認為的住房短缺、低按揭利率及其他住房融資來源（包括由地產商提供的按揭貸款及來自父母的財務支持），將會繼續支持物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會拖累市場情緒。從長遠來看，物業市場將繼續面臨多項阻力。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化繼續推進，本地按揭利率最終將會上升。此外，背靠政府增加土地和住宅物業供應的努力，住房供應與需求的差距預計將逐步收窄，這將會緩和長遠期物業價格的升勢壓力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n香港銀行業在2017年繼續保持安全穩健，儘管存在全球經濟的不明朗因素。獲授權機構（AIs）的資本和流動性狀況仍然強，資產質素保持在健康水平，而盈利能力則因利息差額上升及強勁的信貸增長而顯著改善。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化繼續，2017年香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的1個月和3個月拆息分別上升49%和39。在第4季觀察到更明顯的上升。然而，零售銀行的港元資金成本，以綜合利率衡量，全年大致平穩（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利能力趨勢\n\n零售銀行在香港的辦事處整體稅前營運利潤在2017年增長了15.8%。表現改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）及費用和佣金收入增加（+9.4%）。然而，這些增加部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下跌（-29.9%）以及營運費用增長（+8.4%）所抵銷。零售銀行的整體稅後利潤因2016年記錄的特定一次性項目而下跌18.1%。零售銀行的稅後平均資產回報率從2016年的1.44%下跌至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差由2016年的1.32%擴闊至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例如從2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然手續費及佣金收入上升9.4%，但來自外匯及衍生工具操作的收入則下跌29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，因營運成本（+8.4%）的上升步伐較營運收入（+11.8%）放緩（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值虧損由2016年的80億港元下降至73億港元。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n零售銀行的貸款品質在本年有所改善，不良貸款比率由一年前的0.72%下降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%下降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣地，整個銀行業的不良貸款比率及逾期及重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%下降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行住宅按揭貸款組合的品質仍然保持良好，違約率在2017年底維持在低水平0.03%（圖10）。重組貸款比例接近0%。與一年前相比，年底沒有負資產按揭貸款，而當時有4宗個案。\n\n信用卡貸款的違約率在2017年底保持低水平，為0.22%，較一年前的0.24%（圖10）有所下降。合併的違約及重組貸款比率在該期間從0.33%微降至0.31%。核銷比率亦微升至1.75%，較2016年的1.92%有所下降。\n\n#

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管香港美元匯率面臨減弱的壓力，香港的匯率及貨幣市場繼續以有序的方式運作，並擁有充裕的流動性。聯匯制度一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定性的強大支撐，並展現出對多個衝擊的高度強大承受衝擊能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣的外匯價值平穩，以對美元的外匯市場匯率計，匯率波動範圍在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元之內。貨幣體系的結構特點是由貨幣發行局制度所定義，要求貨幣基礎至少100%由存放在外匯基金的美元儲備支持，並要求貨幣基礎的變動必須100%由相應的美元儲備變動所配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務證書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保\n- 政府發行的紙幣和硬幣流通中\n- 整體餘額，即銀行存放在香港金融管理局（HKMA）的結算賬戶餘額總和\n- 香港金融管理局（HKMA）代表政府發行的外匯基金債券及紙幣（EFBNs）\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局 (HKMA) 對可兌換承擔 (CUs) 的堅決承諾來維持。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率強升至強方可兌換承擔 (CU) 的港元7.75兑1美元時，香港金融管理局準備好向銀行沽出港元以換取美元。總餘額隨即擴大，壓低港元利率，創造貨幣狀況，使港元遠離強方限制，回到7.75至7.85的可兌換區間內。相反地，若港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率弱跌至弱方可兌換承擔 (CU) 的港元7.85兑1美元時，香港金融管理局將從銀行購入港元。總餘額隨即收縮，推高港元利率，使港元遠離弱方限制，維持在7.75至7.85的可兌換區間內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n香港美元匯率在2017年一般見到弱化壓力（圖1）。主要由香港美元與美元利率之間擴闊的負息差推動的息差套利活動，令香港美元自1月3日的7.7566逐步回軟，至8月22日跌至年低的7.8265。香港美元匯率在9月下旬至11月初錄得強勢，因與新股發行相關的資金需求導致香港美元流動性收緊，匯率窄幅波動於7.80至7.81之間。年底再度出現香港美元弱化壓力，部分反映香港美元流動性狀況微升，以及年底美元商業需求增加。整體而言，香港美元匯率市場在整個2017年運作正常。\n\n由於CU未被觸發，總餘額與未償還的EFBNs在2017年仍然無大變動，約為1,2253億港元（圖2）。當年，香港金融管理局為應對銀行對流動性管理需求的增加，發行了總額為800億港元的增發外匯基金債券。這導致總餘額在2017年底減少至1798億港元。增發外匯基金債券的行為在貨幣發行局原則下進行，僅屬於貨幣基礎組成的改變，從總餘額轉向未償還的EFBNs。貨幣基礎仍然全面由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港美元銀行間利率在2017年頭八個月保持鬆動，但在年底面臨更多上行壓力（圖3）。儘管存在對美國聯邦儲備委員會加息及資產負債表正常化的擔憂，香港美元銀行間利率在頭八個月一般仍然保持鬆動。因此，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在1月至8月期間擴闊。自9月起，短期香港美元銀行間利率出現大幅回升，主要由與新股集資活動及年底資金需求推動。相應地，香港美元與美元利率之間的負息差在短期範疇內收窄。總體而言，2017年短期銀行間利率大多數時間低於基準利率。\n\n基準利率分別於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，總計提高75個基點，由1.00%調高至1.75%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率的目標範圍在當年三次上調共75個基點，由0.50至0.75%提高至1.25至1.50%。基準利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的修訂公式進行，該公式規定基準利率設為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標範圍下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息率（HIBORs）五日移動平均數的平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤港元與美元利率息差的走勢，港元遠期點數的折讓在首三個季度逐步擴闊，12個月期港元遠期點數在9月中達到約-615點（圖4）。第4季，港元遠期點數的折讓隨港元與美元利率之間的負息差收窄而微升。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續以有序方式運作，銀行間流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗融資從2016年的53億港元上升至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯匯匯率制度\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯匯制度一直作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大基石，並在一系列區域及全球金融危機中展現出高度的強大承受衝擊能力。特區政府重申對聯匯制度的十足承諾，而其承諾的可信度亦因外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步加強。香港元作為支付手段及保值功能亦持續獲得公眾強烈的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在2017年與香港的第四條協議磋商中，重申支持聯匯制度，並指出聯匯制度仍然為香港最佳的匯率安排。配合穩健的金融監管、謹慎的財政管理及靈活的市場，聯匯制度運作良好，幫助香港成功應對內外各種挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯匯制度維持為香港的最佳安排。」\n\n穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。2017年間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業貸款、與房地產相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管努力，以增強銀行業的韌性。隨著美國聯邦儲備系統（聯儲）繼續將貨幣政策回復至正常，港元利率亦將逐步回復至正常水平。香港金融管理局重申，在LERS的設計下，資金外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方貨幣單位（CU）以及貨幣基礎縮減，都是港元利率正常化的必要過程。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並做好準備應對潛在的財務波動。\n\n為加強貨幣局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月以來，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產分配用以背靠貨幣基礎。背靠比率定義為背靠資產除以貨幣基礎，於2017年期間在106.7–108.2%的範圍內波動，未有觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收盤為108.1%（圖5）。根據LERS，在特定外匯基金資產已指定用於背靠組合的情況下，所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在突發衝擊事件中，外匯基金可觀的金融資源將提供強大的背靠支援，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（CBC）是外匯基金諮詢委員會下屬的委員會，負責監察及審核與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。在2017年，貨幣發行委員會考慮了多個議題，包括香港樓價短期動態的影響因素、香港銀行業拆息率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行業拆息率（LIBOR）息差的決定因素、不動產評估價值變動對中國內地企業貸款的影響，以及按揭債務服務負擔對香港私人消費的影響。貨幣發行委員會就這些議題的討論紀錄，以及提交給貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，已公布於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n香港金融研究機構（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年間，HKIMR更加強調其活動與政策相關性。這一點特別體現在其會議活動和訪問學者計劃中。HKIMR與主要央行及政策機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的會議。同時，於2016年推出的主題研究訪問學者計劃，持續支持更多與香港金融管理局（HKMA）重要的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，HKIMR舉辦了18位研究學者，並公布了29篇工作論文。該機構亦於當年舉辦了四個國際會議和工作坊：\n- 第八輪年度國際中國經濟會議，題為『中國經濟再平衡：其未來方向何在？』，於1月在香港舉行。該會議提供了一個論壇，讓學者、政策制定者和商業經濟學家討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析和政策問題。呈獻了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括內地經濟再平衡、結構改革和國際溢出效應，人民幣匯率問題，以及內地的貨幣政策框架和傳導機制。\n- 第15屆HKIMR夏季工作坊於7月舉行。該工作坊旨在為HKIMR和HKMA的員工提供機會，呈獻他們的研究論文，並提升研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動。\n- 由HKMA與國際清算銀行聯合舉辦的會議，題為『匯率的價格、實體與金融影響』，於8月舉行。該會議提供了一個平台，進行深入且具見地的討論。涵蓋了廣泛的重要議題，包括匯率體系、國際貿易定價體系、外匯儲備積累中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為。\n- 由HKMA、美國聯邦儲備委員會及亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合贊助的會議，主題為『非常規貨幣政策：經驗總結』，於10月舉行。該會議檢討了過去十年主要央行非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗總結。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟和金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out

銀行業穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續將其監管重點放在授權機構風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，HKMA推出了另一輪反週期宏觀審慎措施，以鞏固銀行業應對樓市逆轉的能力。隨著網絡威脅的上升，HKMA加強了對授權機構技術風險管理的監督。同時，HKMA推出了七項措施，為香港邁向智能銀行新紀元作準備。授權機構反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施的有效性，仍然是HKMA重點監管領域，作為其打擊金融犯罪努力的一部分。在行為監管方面，HKMA採取進一步措施推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容，並解決中小企業及新興企業在香港開設和維持銀行賬戶所遇到的困難。亦加強了對授權機構投資及保險產品銷售實務的監管，以進一步鞏固客戶保障。\n\n在本地落實國際監管及會計標準方面取得了重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險敞口限制、復原計劃及國際財務報告準則第9號。為應對在不斷變化的銀行環境及不斷演變的風險生態下對能力建設的需求，香港金融管理局協調業界發展董事權力提升計劃，以及為銀行從業員制定提升能力架構。\n\n《金融機構（解決）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨行業金融機構解決機制的金融穩定理事會成員地區之一。該條例樹立了金融穩定的新防禦主軸，賦予貨幣管理局必要權力，以有序方式管理金融機構在可能導致不利系統性後果的情況下的失敗問題。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局具有一般目標，即推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。取得這個目標取決於金融體系具有高度強大的承受衝擊能力，並能提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式影響系統的穩定性，並在極端情況下可能以混亂方式失敗。貨幣管理局作為監管機構，肩負關鍵地位，透過確保銀行具有強大的承受衝擊能力，並能在應對危機時恢復其地位，進而有助避免失敗，以維護金融穩定。貨幣管理局負責香港銀行業務的審慎監管，包括吸收存款業務。其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構共同稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。貨幣管理局亦負責指定及監督特定金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法保證，香港的審慎監管框架也並非旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣當局作為解決機構，致力於確保在認可機構出現失敗情況時，解決過程可有序進行，以維持認可機構為其顧客提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港已建立金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局是認可機構等其他金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監督活動的概覽\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了192項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括持牌機構（AIs）的CAMEL評分1、公司治理、業務運作及風險管理。作為HKMA持續推動持牌機構更強勁風險治理的一部分，HKMA與持牌機構董事會或董事會級別委員會舉辦了30次會議，討論集中於重要的風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監察其近期公司治理指引的採用情況。此外，亦舉行了27日的三方會議，位居HKMA、持牌機構及其外部核數師之間。\n\n除遠端活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續進行定期現場檢查，並輔以針對評估風險較高的地區的主題審查。這種方法容許香港金融管理局優先配置監管資源，重點關注金融機構面臨的潛在及更顯著的風險。香港金融管理局當年進行了401次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理與控制仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一個主要重點是科技風險及營運風險管理。香港金融管理局亦提升了海外檢查的數字，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制的現場檢查和主題審查的數字。金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動現場檢查，亦由專門團隊進行。\n\n# 信貸風險監管\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總體銀行貸款增長了16.1%，與2016年的6.5%增長相比。如表2所載，貸款增長是廣泛的。\n\n特別是，與內地相關的貸款在2017年底增長17.5%，達到4,188億港元（表3）。這包括644億港元的貸款入帳，這些貸款是針對香港註冊銀行的內地子公司。\n\nAIs的資產品質在2017年仍然保持健康。零售銀行的不良貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%降至2017年底的0.54%，亦低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，不良貸款比率由0.85%下降至0.67%。至於與內地相關的貸款，零售銀行此類貸款的不良貸款比率由2017年的0.82%降至0.75%。就整個銀行業而言，此比率則由一年前的0.80%下降至0.67%。\n\n在本年內，香港金融管理局加強了監管努力，以保證銀行持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，對銀行對主要企業的風險敞口進行了提升監測。進行了針對性的主題檢查，重點關注信貸風險管理的關鍵控制措施，例如貸款審批標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及對地產商貸款、資產擔保融資和保險費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 不動產按揭貸款\n\n2017年樓價繼續上升。持牌機構（AIs）涉及借款人擁有多個按揭或收入主要來自香港以外地區的貸款有所增加。鑒於這些發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於5月19日推出了另一輪反週期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高持牌機構發放的新住宅按揭貸款資本負擔計算風險權重下限，降低對已有按揭的借款人發放的樓宇按揭貸款適用貸款與價值比率（LTV）上限，以及降低對收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人發放的樓宇按揭貸款適用債務償還比率（DSR）限制。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2009年推出針對樓宇按揭貸款的宏觀審慎措施，提升了銀行對樓市相關風險的應對能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%跌至2017年12月的49%，在反週期措施首度推出前。平均債務服務比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月的41%下降至2017年12月的35%，當時第DSR被首次應用（圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）見到一些地產商以高槓桿率為其物業發展項目提供資金，其中一些向物業買家提供了高貸款對價值比率（LTV）的按揭。為解決與這些發展相關的風險，HKMA於5月12日推出了針對向地產商貸款的新風險管理措施。這些措施包括要求銀行機構（AIs）降低建設融資的融資上限；要求銀行機構為其向地產商貸款設立更多資本準備，這些地產商的按揭貸款佔其股權的比例較高；並進行一輪主題檢查，以確保銀行繼續跟進其向地產商貸款時遵循謹慎的信貸標準。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2月與地政總署合作開展電子警報服務。電子警報服務會在有關按揭財產的進一步按揭登記提交至地政總署時，向有關認可機構發出通知，以便按揭銀行能根據情況採取適當的風險緩衝措施。\n\n# 操作及技術風險的監督\n\n網絡安全威脅在一年內持續上升。香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了監管努力，以提升銀行業的網絡安全韌性。作為HKMA於2016年推出「網絡安全強化計劃」（CFI）的一部分，30間銀行完成了對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。另一方面，HKMA與證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）在與銀行及證券業進行廣泛諮詢後，聯合決定為網上股份交易推出強制性的雙重驗證。亦進行了一輪針對銀行網絡安全控制及運營韌性的現場檢查。HKMA進一步與主要銀行的高層管理人員完成了一輪討論，以評估銀行如何管理由科技推動的潛在新市場參與者所帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n9月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布推出一項措施包，協助香港銀行業遷移至智慧銀行的新紀元。在監管方面，HKMA提升金融科技監管沙盒至2.0版本，新功能包括聊天室功能，可供銀行及科技公司雙方使用，並設立連結，位居香港金融管理局（HKMA）、證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）及保險業監理機構（IA）的沙盒之間，以提供進行跨行業金融科技產品測試的單一入口。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出了「Banking Made Easy」倡議，旨在識別並減低監管摩擦，以進一步提升顧客使用金融科技和數字銀行服務的經驗。已設立一個專案小組，現時的重點是遠程開戶和賬戶維護，網上金融和網上財富管理。\n\n現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》的檢討已經展開，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n\n# ＃監督國庫業務及流動性風險\n\n當美國繼續回復至正常貨幣政策時，全球資金流動可能變得日益波動。鑒於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度加強了對流動性風險監管的重點。HKMA透過增發情景提升其監管流動性壓力測試，包括一個更嚴峻但合理的資金外流情景，以及一個短期、信心驅動的銀行擠提情景。HKMA亦加強對個別持牌機構流動性狀況的監測與分析，並規定選定的持牌機構鞏固其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了對持牌機構（AIs）債務證券組合市場風險管理的現場檢查。並進行了一輪主題審查，以評估由持牌機構（AIs）在境外貨幣債券投資活動上升所引起的潛在風險，以及評估相應風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖實務。\n\n#

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新措施旨在促進銀行及支付行業金融科技的發展與應用，受到持份者及公眾的廣泛好評。由於在這方面進行了一連串網絡及能力建設的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升。債券通的推出進一步鞏固了香港作為內地機遇主要門戶的地位。香港金融管理局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力也開始見成效。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑑於科技迅速發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於9月宣布推出七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新紀元作準備。這些措施包括：  \n- 開展快速支付系統（FPS），爭取實現數字零售支付的十足連繫；  \n- 推出開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；  \n- 加強金融科技研究及人才發展；  \n- 推動跨境金融科技合作；  \n- 升級現有金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；  \n- 促進虛擬銀行的推出；以及  \n- 推動「Banking Made Easy」新措施，減低顧客在數字化體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局的銀行部門一同發揮樞紐地位，推動這些倡議的落實，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升，香港按揭證券有限公司基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的夥伴數字，由成立時約40%增至2018年1月31日的87個。在這一年間，IFFO舉辦及參與了超過10個研討會及工作坊，以促進經驗分享和合作聯繫位居關鍵持份者前列。特別是，IFFO在首屆債務融資及投資者座談會上推動制定基礎設施股權投資參考條款表，旨在加強基礎設施項目的銀行可貸性及投資可行性。\n\n債券通於7月推出，標誌香港與內地資本市場相互接軌的另一個重大里程碑，進一步鞏固香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場門戶的的地位。當年，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度從2,700億元人民幣上升至5,000億元人民幣。香港維持全球最大離岸人民幣流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動暢旺，體現在本港人民幣即時全額結算（RTGS）系統交易量創下新高，以及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據最大份額。\n\n繼2016年推出針對企業財資中心（CTCs）的稅務制度後，香港金管局加強其外展努力，旨在吸引更多的跨國企業在香港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，超過40%的企業向香港金管局反映，他們正在積極計劃或已在香港設立財資中心業務。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極貢獻於國際間關於全球及區域金融穩定重要議題的討論。香港金融管理局（HKMA）首席執行官於4月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導關於關鍵金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及快捷運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位奠定了紥實根基。2017年，4宗銀行間RTGS系統及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）取得100%系統可用率，較目標99.95%更高。為支持債券通北向交易，CMU已設立賬戶於兩間內地中央證券存管機構（CSDs），以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表有關CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為推動本地零售支付業界的一般安全及效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）指定4宗零售支付系統（RPSs），使其運作納入香港金融管理局的監督範圍。香港金融管理局亦進行了對16間儲值支付工具（SVF）許可證持有人的監督，這些持有人積極推出新產品及服務，旨在為顧客帶來更多選擇和更理想用戶經驗。另一方面，電子支票及電子帳單呈交及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，包括香港與廣東省全部地區之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行措施\n\n在科技快速進步的情況下，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於9月宣布了七項倡議，這些倡議旨在幫助香港預備，邁入智慧銀行的新紀元。這些倡議旨在幫助銀行業上升到較高水平，並把握由銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n智慧銀行會為零售和企業顧客之間帶來十足的互相連繫，並允許金融服務和交易以重大流動性、速度、緩和和安全性被執行。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直與銀行業界和金融科技社區密切工作，在實施七項倡議方面取得良好進展。\n\n# 加快支付系統\n\n快速支付系統是一個多幣種平台，將讓公眾能夠透過使用手機號碼或電郵地址，輕鬆地進行24小時實時資金轉賬。該系統可支援以香港美元及人民幣進行支付。銀行及非銀行支付服務提供者均可參與快速支付系統，讓所有支付參與者之間實現十足連繫。系統開發工作接近完成，預定於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導一個工作小組，該小組由主要信用卡方案營運商、銀行、持牌SVF營運商及商戶收單機構組成，以建立香港零售支付的共通二維碼標準。共通的二維碼標準會促進商戶使用單一的二維碼來接受來自多個支付服務提供者的二維碼支付方案，為顧客和商戶提供更大的便利。工作小組已最終確定有關的技術規範，並會制定落實安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放 API 允許第三方存取銀行的數據，以促進更理想且更輕鬆的服務整合，包括銀行及其他產業所提供的服務。因此，用戶可以便於在一個系統中享受融入服務，並在安全的環境中使用。為促進銀行業對開放 API 的發展與採用，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已擬訂一份開放 API 架構草案，內容包括選擇開放 API 的職能與部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商的治理、促進措施及維護模式，並進行兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才培育\n\n主要研究專案之一為分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年首份DLT白皮書之後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月發布。第二份白皮書進一步探討三項概念驗證（Proof-of-Concept）工作，即貿易融資、數字身分管理及房貸申請。亦就落實DLT於銀行及支付產業的相關治理、法律合規及一般控制原則提供意見。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）總裁陳諾文先生於香港金融管理局金融科技日（HKMA Fintech Day）上宣布發佈有關區塊鏈技術（DLT）的第二份白皮書。\n\n在香港金融管理局（HKMA）主導的貿易融資概念驗證工作取得成功後，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，打造名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）的生產系統，以數碼化並股份貿易文件，自動化流程，旨在提升整體貿易流程，並減少貿易融資業務中的風險和詐騙。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才庫，香港金管局於2016年12月與香港應用科學及科技研究院合作推出了「金融科技職業加速計劃」。學生的呼應是正面的。收到超過3,000份申請，來自421名申請人。最後，74名學生公認來自香港金管局及12間銀行的實習機會，從7月開始參與與金融科技相關的專案，持續六個月或一年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強廣東-香港-澳門大灣區內合作的第一步，我們正與深圳合作推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽訂協議，將（i）為金融科技公司提供相互的軟著陸支持；（ii）於10月共同舉辦深圳-香港金融科技獎，以表彰和獎勵兩地優秀的金融科技產品及解決方案；以及（iii）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融公司進行暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳諾文先生（中間）在香港金融管理局金融科技日上，與OFDS總監賴小軍先生（左）及數碼港主席李國全博士簽署並交換關於軟落地安排的合作備忘錄。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎項電子傳單\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務監管局簽訂金融科技合作協議，涵蓋創新專案、創新企業的轉介、資訊分享及專業知識交流。\n\n在11月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進一步與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）簽署了一項了解，以聯合建立全球貿易連繫網絡（GTCN），該網絡會將新加坡的國家貿易平台連接到香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP），以形成跨境DLT基礎設施，以便數字化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、快捷和成本效益更高。它將是一個開放平台，允許其他感興趣的地區在未來參與。GTCN預計將於2019年第一季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年9月推出的FSS已升級至FSS 2.0，以促進與銀行及科技公司的溝通，推動新想法和新計劃。具體而言，FSS 2.0具有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，以便在金融科技項目的早期階段向銀行和科技公司提供意見。\n- 科技公司可以通過聊天室尋求意見來訪問FSS，而無需通過銀行。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監理機（SFC）和保險業監理機構的沙盒已聯匯，以便為跨行業金融科技產品的試驗提供單一入口點。\n\n截至2017年底，FSS中已有28項新技術產品接受考驗。在這些宗中，有14%試點試驗已完成，有關產品隨後已推出至市場。\n\n# 銀行取得輕鬆倡議\n\n為減低阻礙科技創新的監管摩擦，已推出「Banking Made

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

備付金管理\n\n全球經濟及金融市場在2017年的表現理想，超出預期。全球股市因主要發達及新興市場經濟同步增長、強勁的企業盈利，以及市場預期主要央行會緩慢且逐步收緊貨幣政策而走高。雖然美國聯邦儲備理事會如預期般提升利率三次，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表，但10年期美國國債收益率仍然平穩，美元對其他主要貨幣回落（不強化反而弱化）。在這樣有利的環境下，儲備基金的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下歷史新高，投資回報率為7.4%。\n\n# 兌換基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》訂立，外匯基金的主要目標是影響香港貨幣的匯率，無論是直接或間接。基金亦可被用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以幫助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於財政司司長認為適當的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\nEFAC 已為 Exchange Fund 設立以下投資目標：  \n(a) 保障資本；  \n(b) 保證全部貨幣基礎在任何時候均全面支持於流通性極高的美元計值資產；  \n(c) 保證足夠流動性不詳用於維持貨幣及金融穩定性的目的；以及  \n(d) 在(a)–(c)的前提下，爭取投資回報以幫助保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標選持十足考慮了交易所基金的法定目的，並被納入基金的組合結構和目標資產組合中。\n\n大致來說，儲備基金擁有兩大組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元計值資產，以根據貨幣局制度的規定，提供十足保障予貨幣基礎。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國家的債券及股票市場，以保障資產價值及其長期購買力。\n\n為理想管理風險並提升長期及中期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以謹慎且循序漸進的方式，將儲備基金的部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合（IP）管理，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）管理。LTGP下投資的市場價值上限設為儲備基金累積結餘的三分之一，進一步的容量則由未來基金部分資金配置至長期資產而引起。\n\n於2007年設立的戰略組合，用於持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該股份由政府為香港外匯基金帳戶購入，用於戰略目的，因該組合的獨特性，此組合未被納入基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 存款於 Exchange Fund\n\n香港儲備基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP1的表現聯網，但未來基金則視乎組合比例，將利率與IP及LTGP聯網。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的組合比例約為65：35。與LTGP聯網的未來基金部分預計將逐步增加至約50%，於2018年實現。\n\n# 投資流程\n\nExchange Fund的投資過程因兩種資產配置的決定而提升：戰略性資產配置和戰略性地資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑑於Exchange Fund的投資目標所確定的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略性配置的指導下，資產會被戰略性地配置，以爭取實現超越基準的超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準或戰略性配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準和追蹤誤差限制是由財政司長與EFAC磋商後定出，但戰略性決定及戰略性偏離的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局在被授權的範圍內制定和設立。在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內，組合經理可以選持頭寸以利用短期市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n#直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的儲備管理部門直接管理約73%的外匯基金投資，其中包括全部的BP和部分IP。這部分IP包括設立一組投資組合，投資於全球固定收益市場，以及各種衍生工具疊加投資組合，用以實施宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n此外，除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）僱用外部基金經理來管理約27日%的儲備基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他專業資產類別。僱用外部經理的目的是運用市場上可得的最佳投資專業知識，以取得可持續的回報，從多樣化且互補的投資方式中受惠，並與儲備基金分享市場心得及技術專業知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理及托管費用、交易成本，以及扣留稅及其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素定出，可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n2008\/09年全球金融危機後，金融市場的高波動性突顯了風險管理的重要性。嚴格的控制措施和投資指引已為內部及外圍方面管理的投資組合設立，並密切監察遵守指引和法規的情況。風險評估已加強，以支持匯換基金投資多元化上升的步伐。風險控制工具被採用，以在正常及不利市場狀況下評估市場風險。亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，讓香港金融管理局充分發揮內部及外部管理者的投資技能。\n\n# 肩負投資\n\n香港金管局支持負責任的投資。例如，香港金管局支持證券及期貨事務監理機關於2016年3月7日發行的《負責任擁有權原則》，這些原則具自願性，幫助投資者釐定最佳方式以應對其擁有權責任，涉及對香港上市公司的投資。在管理儲備基金方面，香港金管局已鼓勵管理其香港股權組合的指定外部基金管理機構，在管理投資時採納《負責任擁有權原則》。此外，前台部門及風險管理及合規部已將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入多個內部程序，以制定及監察投資活動。香港金管局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入投資流程。\n\n# 兌換基金的表現\n\n# 2017年的金融市場\n\n2017年全球經濟和金融市場表現理想。在主要發達國家和新興市場經濟體同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行貨幣政策將緩慢且逐步收緊的推動下，全球股市表現亦佳。特別是香港股市上漲了36%，表現出色於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場中，由於美國聯邦儲備委員會如預期般三次提升利率，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表，短期美國國債收益率飆升。然而，美國10年期國債收益率全年維持約2.4%的平穩水平。其他主要國家的10年期政府債券收益率亦在年底變化不大，惟德國公債除外，因其受益於歐元區紥實的經濟增長，以及市場對歐洲央行政策收緊的預期而上升。\n\n在貨幣市場中，儘管美國聯邦儲備理事會進行了加息並開始縮減其資產負債表，美元對其他主要貨幣仍有所回落。美元的下跌是因為歐洲和日本經濟的回升，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策分歧將收窄。2017年，歐元和日圓分別對美元升值約14%和4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣亦債券和股票市場的表現如表1所載。\n\n表1 2017年市場回報\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n儲備基金在2017年錄得2,640億港元的投資收入。這包括海外股票的804億港元回報、香港股票的583億港元回報、債券的344億港元回報、非港元資產的535億港元正面貨幣估值效果，以及投資控股附屬機構持有的其他投資的374億港元回報。另一方面，戰略組合錄得45億港元的估值回報。\n\n去年香港基金的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下新高，較2007年的紀錄（1,422億港元）高出1,218億港元。\n\n香港儲備基金的總資產於年底達40,153億港元。LTGP下的投資市場價值總值為2,356億港元，其中私人股權為1,572億港元，房地產為784億港元。未償還的投資承諾總值為162.4億港元。\n\n香港儲備基金（不包括戰略組合）在2017年的投資回報為7.4%。具體而言，IP取得12.1%的回報率，而BP錄得1.8%的回報。LTGP自2009年成立以來，錄得了13.7%的年化內部回報率。\n\n自1994年至2017年，基金的年回報率設立於圖1中。表2顯示2017年的投資回報及基金在多個不同年期的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年為2.5%，過去十年為2.2%，自1994年以來為4.9%。表3顯示截至2017年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n香港按揭證券有限公司副行政總裁葉國華先生（中間）在記者會上發言，主題為2017年外匯基金業績。\n\n圖1

The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the

僱用社區 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體密切合作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及工作的了解。2017年舉辦了86場開放的公眾活動，包括九場記者會、十六場站立式訪問及六十一項其他公眾職能。此外，安排了四十二次媒體訪問，並發行了共三百六十份雙語新聞稿。亦每天處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提升各界對香港金融管理局（HKMA）主要職能的認識，已為媒體舉辦導覽活動，讓媒體參觀全新翻新的HKMA資訊中心。此外，亦就廣泛話題，包括債券通機制、物業按揭貸款審慎措施、解決機制及外匯基金投資，為本地及海外媒體舉辦深入的媒體簡報及教育工作坊。\n\n香港按揭證券有限公司行政總裁陳諾文先生在香港按揭證券有限公司資訊中心向媒體推出一幅稱為《小改變，大頌歌》的馬賽克藝術作品。這幅藝術作品以維多利亞港及香港天際線為主題，由總共135,811枚不同面額的香港硬幣締造而成。\n\n香港按揭證券有限公司首席執行官陳諾文先生與本地報紙進行媒體訪問，就香港按揭證券有限公司基礎設施融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室的重點措施進行介紹。\n\n#公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務提供了一種有效的方式，讓公眾能更理想地理解香港金融管理局（HKMA）的關鍵職能和運作。2017年共處理了8,752宗查詢，約下半年的查詢與銀行政策和法規、貨幣和經濟問題、消費者銀行問題以及紙幣和硬幣相關。明顯的例子包括硬幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行相關指引及通函、貨幣及經濟統計數據、物業按揭貸款審慎措施，以及防止洗錢和恐怖主義融資。\n\n圖1顯示自2014年以來收到的公眾查詢數字，圖2提供2017年收到的查詢以性質計的分類。\n\n圖1 總數字的公眾查詢\n\n圖2 2017年收到的查詢性質\n\n# 刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，2017年香港金融管理局公布了兩期半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告及4宗季度通訊，並定期更新月度統計通訊，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊及分析。此外，香港金融管理局共發行23篇inSight文章，涵蓋與其工作相關的多個熱門話題。\n\n# HKMA 網站\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）擁有逾60,000頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文網頁，是公眾取得有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。網站亦包含根據《銀行條例》第20條維持的獲授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs證券人員登記冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維持的儲值設施（SVF）持牌機構登記冊。專門網頁及醒目快捷連結設計用以引起公眾對香港金融管理局新措施的關注，例如開戶、SVF監管制度、基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室，以及重要及及時資訊，例如提醒公眾對詐騙電話需保持嚴陣以待，以及硬幣收集計劃下硬幣推車的位置。\n\n#公共教育計劃\n\n香港金管局資訊中心位於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向社區介紹金管局工作及推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心設有展覽範疇及圖書館，每周六天對公眾開放。展覽範疇推出金管局的工作及香港貨幣銀行的發展情況，亦包含用於研究香港貨幣、銀行及財政事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n資訊中心政策專區經過翻新工程後，於2017年2月24日重新啟用，這個改裝後的專區推出香港金融管理局（HKMA）的工作及相關金融概念。改裝後的政策專區包含多個互動遊戲及裝置，將發揮融入學習，以簡單的方式解釋複雜的金融概念。遊客的意見為正面。\n\n學生在資訊中心的政策部門試玩教育遊戲，以了解香港金融管理局的工作。\n\n資訊中心為遊客舉辦導覽團。在這一年中，它收到了超過59,000名遊客，並為學校和其他團體舉辦了超過650場導覽團（圖3）。自2003年12月啟用以來，已有超過645,000名市民造訪資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽範疇旁邊，收藏超過23,000本書籍、期刊及其他刊物，用於研究香港的貨幣、銀行及財政事務和中央銀行主題。亦維持AIs及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及AIs證券人員的登記冊，根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的圖書館。\n\n為接觸社區並提升公眾對香港金融管理局（HKMA）工作的認識，香港金融管理局於2017年舉辦4宗公眾教育研討會，參與對象為約2,000名中學生及教師。研討會涵蓋的主題包括聯匯率制度、香港紙幣、銀行體系穩定性、消費者保障、存款保障計劃、金融科技、一帶一路倡議及金融業職業。自1998年推出以來，已有超過58,400人參與此公眾教育計劃。\n\n來自不同區的第二學校的學生和老師參加一場公共教育研討會。\n\n圖3 2017年資訊中心群組訪問的類別\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）招募、培訓並維持一支高度專業的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的重點工作。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但它僱用員工的條件與公務員制度有所不同，以吸引具備正確經驗和專業知識的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力保持精簡靈活的架構，並在可能的情況下，重新部署員工資源以推動新計劃，並應對不斷增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n解決辦公室於2017年4月1日設立，旨在落實2016年6月頒佈的《金融機構（解決）條例》。該辦公室旨在確保香港的解決機制對銀行而言可有效運作。這對於在任何危機事件中加強香港銀行業的韌性至關重要。\n\n# 人力配置\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2017年設立時為927人，此數字將於2018年增加35人，達到962人（增幅為3.8%），以保證足夠的資源得以提供，以應付新措施以及現有工作的增加複雜性和工作量。新設的職位將被採用於以下職能：\n\n加強銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n    – 加強支援加快支付系統及便捷銀行服務計劃的推行能力；\n    – 加強監管能力以應對銀行的地區及業務擴張，並促進（i）金融科技在銀行服務供應中的更廣泛採用，以及（ii）與其他監管機構在網絡安全及金融科技議題上的合作；以及\n    – 支援反詐騙及洗錢情報專隊的工作，以打擊詐騙、洗錢及其他類別的金融犯罪，並加強對反洗錢及SVFs法規執行行動的法律支援。\n- 加強投資、風險管理及其他相關支援，以推動儲備基金投資活動的進一步擴張及多元化。\n- 加強全球宏觀及金融部門監測，並加強人才培訓計劃，以保證香港金融管理局擁有足夠的人力資源，應對機構的長期發展需求。\n\n表1提供了香港金融管理局（HKMA）的設立和強大的詳細說明。\n\n表1 2018年1月1日HKMA的設立及強大\n\n臨時資源被採用以應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局亦會將借調的員工轉調至其他國際或本地組織，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助香港或香港金融管理局有興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分員工以十足時間或部分時間形式被採用，以提供運作支援予香港存款保障局及財政市場協會。\n\n#

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

外匯基金\n\n# 審計主任報告\n\n# 獨立審計師的報告 致財政司\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審核證券交易所基金及其附屬機構（「集團」）設立於第157至243頁的財務報表，其中包括證券交易所基金及集團截至2017年12月31日的資產負債表，以及其收入及支出賬戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表及現金流量表，截至該年度終結時止，以及財務報表附註，包括顯著會計政策摘要。\n\n在我看來，財務報表截至2017年12月31日，就基金及集團的財務地位，以及該年度結束時的財務表現及現金流量，均帶來真實及公平的觀點，並按照香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）及根據財務司司長根據《財務司條例》（第66條）第7條頒佈的指示，已妥為編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我按照首席執行官根據《財政儲備條例》第7條頒發的指示及審計委員會的審計標準進行審計。我在這些標準下的責任進一步載於我的報告中「審計財務報表的審計師責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與集團保持獨立，並已按照這些標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我取得的審計證據足夠且適當，可作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 关键审计事项\n\n關鍵審計事項係指根據我的專業判斷，在2017年12月31日終結之財務報表審計過程中最具重要性之事項。這些事項係在審計財務報表整體情況下進行處理，並在形成我的意見時予以考量，我並未就這些事項提供單獨意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理局 肩負 其他資訊的責任。其他資訊 包括 香港貨幣管理局2017年年度報告中所 包括 的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師對此的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我並未對此發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n在進行財務報表審計的過程中，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中考慮該其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則是否顯著錯誤。如果根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為該其他資訊存在重大錯誤，則我必須報告此事實。在這方面，我無任何內容需要報告。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計委員會關於財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣管理局肩負根據香港會計師公會發行的HKFRSs及行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條頒發的指示，準備能夠帶來真實及公平觀點的財務報表的責任，以及貨幣管理局認為是必要的內部控制措施，以確保能夠準備出沒有重大錯誤陳述的財務報表，無論是因為欺詐還是錯誤。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局須肩負評估集團持續經營能力的責任，並在適用的情況下披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及使用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n匯換基金顧問委員會的審計委員會肩負監督集團財務報告流程的責任。\n\n# 審計師的責任財務報表的審計\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認整體財務報表是否不存在因舞弊或錯誤所導致的重大錯報，並發行包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水平的保證，但並不能保證按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，一向能發現當存在重大錯報時的錯報。錯報可能來自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或整體而言，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計標準進行審計的一部分，我運用專業判斷並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我也：  \n- 識別並評估財務報表存在重大錯報的風險，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，設計並發揮針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。未能發現因舞弊導致的重大錯報風險，較因錯誤導致的重大錯報風險更高，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制的行為；  \n- 為了設計符合情況的審計程序，了解與審計相關的內部控制，但並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；  \n- 評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；  \n- 對貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎的會計方法的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或狀況相關的重大不確定性。若我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，則必須在審計師報告中指出財務報表中相關的披露，若披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或狀況可能導致集團無法持續經營；  \n- 評估財務報表整體的呈報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以達到公平呈報的方式反映其底層交易和事件；以及  \n- 取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表財務報表意見。我對集團審計的指揮、監督和執行負有責任，並維持對我的審計意見的單獨責任。\n\n我與 Exchange Fund Advisory 委員會的審計委員會就…進行溝通，包括其他事項，如審計的計劃範圍和時間安排以及顯著的審計結果，包括我在審計中識別出的任何顯著的內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦向證券交易所基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會提供一份聲明，表明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關保障措施。\n\n根據與基金會諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項，我釐定哪些事項在本期財務報表審計中具有最大重要性，並因此成為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果可能合理預期會超過此類溝通的公共利益利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n戴維德 孫  \n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要活動\n\n貨幣管理局根據財政司司長作為基金主管的授權，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66號）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是維護港元匯率穩定，以及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產分為4宗組合管理：Backing Portfolio（支持組合）、Investment Portfolio（投資組合）、Long-Term Growth Portfolio（長期增長組合）及Strategic Portfolio（戰略組合）。支持組合的資產全面匹配香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股權市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府（HKSAR）為基金的戰略目的購入。營運範疇資訊設立於附註30。\n\n# 2 顯著會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係按照所有適用的香港財務報告準則 (HKFRSs) 編製，該準則係一個集體名稱，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則 (HKASs) 及由香港會計師公會 (HKICPA) 發行的解釋，以及在香港一般公認的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（一同稱為集團）採用的重要會計政策摘要列於下方。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行特定的新版及修訂版香港財務報告準則，這些準則於現時會計期間首期生效或可供提前採用。附註3提供資訊，關於會計政策如有任何變更，源自新股採用這些發展，在與集團現時及以往會計期間相關的範圍內，反映於這些財務報表中。\n\n# 2.2% 製備財務報表的基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，亦包括集團對聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n在編製財務報表時所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除下列資產及負債強調其公允價值，如說明於下方所列之會計政策：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註2.11）；及\n- 投資性不動產（附註2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些判斷、估計和假設會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告數額。這些估計和相關假設是根據經驗和多個其他因素而制定，這些因素在當時的情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成了對資產和負債的帳面價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值從其他來源並不容易明顯看出。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及相關假設會持續進行檢討。若修訂只影響該期，則會計估計的修訂會在該期認可；若修訂同時影響現時及未來各期，則會在修訂當期及未來各期認可。\n\n附註18包含關於投資性不動產公允價值估計相關假設的資訊。附註36%包含關於金融工具公允價值估計相關假設的資訊。除涉及這些公允價值估計的會計判斷外，在應用集團的會計政策時沒有其他關鍵會計判斷參與。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是由集團所控制的實體。當集團對某實體擁有控制權時，表示集團暴露於或擁有來自該實體參與的浮動回報，並能透過對該實體的實力來影響這些回報。在評估集團是否擁有實力時，僅考慮由集團和其他方舉辦的實質性權利。\n"}
