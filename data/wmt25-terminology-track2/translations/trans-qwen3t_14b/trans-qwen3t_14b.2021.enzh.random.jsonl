{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over

首席執行官的聲明\n\n2021年是同時整固與發展的一年。\n\n2021年，疫情踏入第二年，情況未見緩和：全球供應鏈中斷，通脹壓力上升，全球金融條件過早收緊的風險增加。不確定性進一步增加，包括新型冠狀病毒變異株的出現，以及地緣政治緊張局勢的升溫。儘管如此充滿不確定性的宏觀環境，我們仍持續保障貨幣與金融穩定，並維持營運韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來復甦的希望，因新冠疫苗的成功推出，以及多個經濟體推出的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟開始從2020年的嚴重收縮中復甦。本地方面，在經歷2019年及2020年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟於2021年增長6.3%，受惠於疫苗接種計劃的推出及政府的防疫紓困措施，這些措施為我們的經濟復甦提供了至關重要的支持。\n\n在財政及貨幣穩定性得以維持，以及宏觀環境穩定的情況下，2021年為我們提供了一些空間，以推動更多發展工作。我們把握機會，積極推進有助我們金融部門保持高度競爭力的發展計劃。我們在三個戰略重點方面取得了顯著進展，即金融科技、綠色金融，以及香港作為門戶角色所產生的內地市場機會。\n\n踏入2022年，全球環境情況轉為惡化。但有云：當困難來臨時，勇者更會奮起。我們將繼續保持主動，追求我們的發展目標和優先事項，以更好地準備面對下一步的挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們也將堅定不移地承諾確保香港貨幣和金融體系的穩健，正如我們在過去多次成功應對了很多挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定性：國際金融中心的基礎\n\n自從1983年設立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直是香港金融體系的強大支柱，並有助香港抵禦無數衝擊和挑戰。儘管新型冠狀病毒肺炎造成的持續不確定性以及市場對美國貨幣政策收緊步伐的憂慮，香港美元匯兌及貨幣市場全年繼續有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n我們對系統的信心並非一朝一夕就能建立，而是以多年來建立的穩健基礎為基礎。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年外匯部門報告中再次重申，LERS的可信度已透過一套透明的規則、充裕的財政與外匯儲備、強化的財政監管與監督、靈活的經濟體制，以及謹慎的財政框架而得到保障。\n\n信心亦是我們在公眾和市場參與以及有效監測方面的努力成果。在後者方面，我們借助科技與數據分析，加強了在金融穩定與宏觀審慎監測方面的分析能力，以進行更及時且全面的分析。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。在新冠疫情爆發兩年後，本港銀行仍然具備足夠流動性及資本充足率，表現非常出色，達國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行的資本充足率高達20.2%，遠高於最低要求的8%，而大型銀行在2021年第四季度的平均流動性覆蓋比率為151.9%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。儘管疫情下信貸環境充滿挑戰，銀行業的資產質素在當年大致保持穩定。業界分類貸款比率在2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的支柱\n\n一如既往，銀行業一直是經濟活動的重要支柱。鑑於新型冠狀病毒疫情對經濟造成的衝擊，這一點變得更加至關重要。過去一年，主要的挑戰是在銀行業管理信貸風險與維持對實體經濟的支持之間取得平衡。憑藉多年來的監管工作，銀行繼續有效管理信貸風險。同時，我們與銀行緊密合作，透過預先批核的貸款本金延期償還計劃（PPPHS）及其他緩衝措施，向企業及個人客戶提供急需的緩衝。PPPHS於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制攜手推出，讓符合資格的企業客戶可在預先批核基礎上將貸款本金償還期延後六個月。2021年期間，該計劃兩度延長至2022年4月，鑑於部分經濟部門仍因疫情持續而面臨經營環境艱難，需要持續的信貸緩衝。其後，鑑於本地新型冠狀病毒病例數字反彈，2022年2月，PPPHS進一步延長至2022年10月底。令人鼓舞的是，儘管銀行業本身因疫情爆發而面臨經營困難，但銀行業已與香港金融管理局（HKMA）攜手合作，協助企業及個人借款人緩解資金周轉壓力。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境，疫情也帶來了更困難的營運環境，以及伴隨持續增加的網絡威脅的數字化環境。我們已加強努力，提升銀行業的營運及網絡韌性，以及在數字化不斷增加和釣魚詐騙急升的情況下，加強消費者和投資者的保護。特別是，《銀行業實務守則》已進行修訂，以提升數字金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n此外，我們致力於推動金融包容及以客戶為中心的文化。增強有需要客戶使用銀行服務的方便性一直是我們的工作重點，我們亦一直與業界緊密合作，制訂行業指引。除了無障礙銀行服務的指引，以及為智障人士提供銀行服務的指引外，業界在金管局的支持下，於2021年12月發出一份指引，列出銀行業為認知障礙人士及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好實踐。\n\n為支持銀行業未來持續發展，面對新的增長機會和挑戰，需要從業員具備一整套新技能，香港金融管理局制定了全面的人才發展策略——「聯繫人才，迎接未來」，以系統化及針對性方式培育未來人才，並提升現有從業員的專業能力。我們的新策略建基於三個「聯繫」方向：聯繫學生與銀行業、聯繫從業員與銀行業的未來，以及聯繫關鍵持份者，加強策略落實過程中的合作。我們已推出一系列外展及宣傳活動，吸引更多學生進入銀行業。為讓大學學生更好地準備迎接未來，我們與香港銀行家協會聯同推出「未來銀行橋接計劃」，該計劃包括一系列課程，涵蓋銀行業高度需求的實用知識及軟技能。針對現有銀行從業員，我們正與業界緊密合作，發展更多受歡迎的培訓課程，以提升他們的專業技能。2021年12月，銀行從業員加強能力框架下的新金融科技模組正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與所有持份者攜手合作，鑑於加強人才庫以促進產業的進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強地位由無可比擬的機會接觸支撐\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，由其無可比擬的機會接觸所支撐。普遍共識認為，全球金融科技採用、內地金融市場開放以及綠色和可持續金融的主流化，將為香港金融業的未來發展帶來巨大機會。在香港金管局，我們致力於投入大量資源，利用香港獨特的優勢來把握這些機會。讓我首先介紹金融科技和內地的機會。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情已清楚顯示金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為確保我們能繼續保持在全球金融科技領域的領先地位，並準備挖掘金融科技的所有潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓金融科技的價值能橫跨所有層面，並被所有群體所體驗。\n\n這個願景由於我們制定了一項新策略「Fintech 2025」，該策略於2021年6月公布。正如其名稱所示，該策略旨在協助金融業至2025年全面應用科技。該策略包括五個重點範疇，涵蓋實現成功生態系統所需的要素，亦包括生態系統在生生不息的循環中進一步增長所需的正確因素。策略的首兩個部分，即「所有銀行進行金融科技」和「加深研究香港在中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDCs）方面的準備工作」，主要旨在創造更多金融科技應用的需求。策略的其他部分則涉及數據、基礎設施、人才和資金，這些都是生態系統增長的重要因素。\n\n根據此策略，已推出多項新措施，例如粵港澳大灣區金融科技試點測試設施，允許金融機構及科技公司進行試點測試，並從監管機構及用戶處取得針對其跨境金融科技措施的盡早回饋；以及試點推出商業數據交換平台，利用替代數據來促進中小企業融資。我們亦加強了對批發型數字貨幣應用於跨境支付的研究，並探討e-HKD的前景，這將提升香港在採納數字貨幣方面的準備，進而為未來幾十年做好準備，確保本城市的金融基礎設施具備前瞻性。\n\n在把握科技進步帶來的新機會的同時，我們亦持續發展既有的成果，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，2018年推出的快速支付系統（FPS）在過去幾年迅速發展，至2021年底註冊數目已達到960萬，按年上升40%。每日交易額亦由2020年上升90%，2021年達到約673,000宗即時交易。另一方面，鑑於加密資產尤其用作支付用途的穩定幣的迅速發展，我們今年早前已發佈討論文件，邀請市場就建立合適的監管框架提供回饋。\n\n我們的新策略具前瞻性，將建立金融科技生態系統的健康成長。隨著金融業日益採納金融科技以把握其提供的機會，這將最終使金融機構和香港市民受益，同時加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為內地的主導門戶\n\n香港一如既往在連接內地市場與國際金融市場方面發揮戰略角色，為國際投資者提供一個熟悉且成熟的制度和平台，從事各種類型的金融、投資及財富管理活動。國家「十四五」規劃強化香港作為國際金融中心的地位，使其成為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心。這一點與全球經濟趨勢一同強化了我們的信心，香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場橋樑的獨特價值。\n\n2021年，我們在增強連通性方面達到了一個里程碑，我們的Connect計劃家族新增了兩名成員，即粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通（跨境WMC）計劃，以及債券通下的南向交易，本質上完成了包括股票、債務和理財管理在內的廣泛金融市場的雙向迴路。這兩個計劃的推出將為香港在各方面帶來新的機遇。透過滿足內地投資者日益多樣化的需要，這兩個計劃將擴大我們債券市場和理財管理業的客戶基礎。我很高興看到這兩個計劃運作順利。香港金融管理局將繼續與內地當局保持聯繫，隨著時間推移進一步提升這些計劃。\n"}

2021年摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n2021年，香港經濟在強勁的貨物出口下回復正增長，國內需求回升，並受益於政府支持性政策措施的推動。勞動市場亦有所改善，雖然通脹率微升，但保持溫和。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩定，資本和流動性狀況良好。根據歷史和國際標準，資產質量繼續保持在健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港美元市場繼續以暢順且有序的方式發揮職能，儘管存在與新型冠狀病毒疫情相關的持續不確定性，以及市場對美國貨幣政策收緊步伐的憂慮。聯繫匯率制度繼續運作良好。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n隨著全球金融市場在2021年踏上復甦路徑，香港儲備基金錄得1,919億港元的投資收入，相當於4.1%的投資回報率。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續致力支持負責任的投資及資產多元化。長期增長組合自2009年推出以來，錄得年化內部回報率15.4%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續將重點放在銀行風險管理的監管上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及數字化加快，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已加強對銀行營運及網絡韌性的監管。《銀行業實務守則》亦已修訂，以提升數字金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n在廣泛諮詢後，粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通（跨境WMC）試點計劃已順利推出。香港金管局提供指引，讓銀行透過非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，以提供良好的客戶體驗，並按照保障。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的工作重點是進一步加強銀行防止和偵測與疫情期間上升的網絡金融犯罪相關的非法資金流動的能力。香港金融管理局亦透過公私合營模式深化資訊共享，同時支持遠程客戶開戶，並透過推出首個AML科技實驗室，鼓勵採用包括網絡分析在內的其他科技。\n\n在軟性基礎設施領域作出進一步努力，包括銀行文化及人才發展等範疇。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露方面的標準。香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦推進其在制定解決方案標準、進行解決方案規劃及發展解決方案執行能力方面的工作，以確保銀行具公信力的解決方案制度。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局公布其「Fintech 2025」策略，以推動金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並加強香港在亞洲金融科技中心的地位。在較快支付系統方面，其註冊數目和交易額已顯著發展，應用層面繼續擴大。\n\n在增強連通性方面，跨境WMC及債券通南向交易已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色。\n\n亦致力於締造新業務機會，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括在債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業現金管理中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。\n\n為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強市場推廣，向各種持份者讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所提供的機遇。香港金融學院亦推出新推出的金融領袖計劃，旨在培育香港未來的金融領袖。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）透過各種渠道與社區及市場保持有效聯繫，以提升公眾對其政策及運作的認識。對內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力建立靈活應變及可持續的員工隊伍，建立嚴格的財政紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以應對變化並確保政策及措施的有效落實。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated

2022 年及前瞻重點\n\n全球及本地情況在2022年明顯惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級及美國聯邦儲備系統加息預期觸發了市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟因新型冠狀病毒疫情的新一波而遭受衝擊。鑑於其韌性及多年來建立的緩衝，香港的金融體系保持良好地位，以抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。在這方面，我們將努力透過識別新興風險並以靈活應變的方式作出回應，以保持領先。同時，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將尋求機會，以協助鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心的地位。在香港金融管理局（HKMA）管理匯兌基金的複雜投資環境中，將繼續審慎投資，同時保持靈活，根據情況實施防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性與完整性\n\n全球經濟展望仍受制於重大不確定因素。香港金管局將讓最新發展，並暫停終止權潛力風險，以維持金融體系的韌性和穩定性，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕以對抗潛力風險\n\n展望未來，市場可能受制於更高的波動性，因應各種範疇的不確定性持續上升。一方面，若美國聯邦儲備委員會的貨幣政策正常化以快速步伐繼續，可能在未來明顯地緊縮全球金融條件，並增加全球債務償還負擔。另一方面，鑑於2022年初烏克蘭情勢升級，包括中美緊張關係在內的地緣政治不確定性可能持續保持高水準，並再次引發金融市場波動。最後但同樣重要的是，隨着疫情發展的反覆，若大規模重新實施封鎖措施，可能導致全球供應瓶頸持續存在，不利地影響全球增長與通脹。儘管如此，鑑於多年來建立的韌性與緩衝，香港的金融體系處於良好位置，足以抵禦不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦具備能力、資源及承諾，以保障香港的貨幣與金融穩定。\n\n香港金管局將繼續緊密監察本地及外圍環境中的風險及弱點，並準備就緒在必要時部署合適措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。2022年的研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的問題，並評估其潛在風險。另一方面，香港金管局持續進行的數字化計劃將協助提升其監察能力，以支持更全面的監察和對金融體系的深入分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定性\n\n當發達市場收緊貨幣政策，且疫情的影響持續，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預計將持續充滿挑戰。同時，迅速的科技進步與數字化轉型亦為銀行業呈現機遇與挑戰。面對不斷變化且充滿挑戰的金融環境，香港金融管理局致力透過持續的監管努力，確保銀行抵禦衝擊的能力。同時，香港金融管理局亦將繼續提升並完善其銀行監管及監管框架與政策，採取國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監督重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將加強對銀行信貸風險敞口的監測，並推行主動措施，以確保整體風險層面保持良好可控。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦會繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業營運情況的生效，同時與銀行及商業界維持接近的對話，並保持各種紓困措施在審閱中。\n\n# 營運及技術風險\n\n隨著2022年5月發佈新監管政策手冊（SPM）「運營韌性」模塊，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續與業界保持聯繫，並了解獲授權機構（AIs）在發展其運營韌性框架方面的進展。同時，HKMA將尋求通過跟進AIs在《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》評估中揭示的問題，以及監測AIs實施安全的第三層數據備份，來提升銀行業的網絡韌性。另一個重要的監管重點將是評估和處理AIs對技術服務供應商越來越依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉加強的數字化能力和廣泛的遠程工作經驗，在疫情期間累積，一些AI正計劃在業務如常的基礎上轉向混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將讓這項發展軌道，並評估是否相關風險已由業界充分應對。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將於2022年專注於監管金融機構的流動性及市場風險管理。特別是，HKMA將繼續監察金融機構在2023年6月30日前逐步過渡離開餘下的倫敦銀行同業拆息率（LIBOR）設定的進展，因為這些設定將於該日期停止發出。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義資金\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的工作將繼續聚焦於透過協作及資訊共享，加強對詐騙及金融犯罪的因應，並投身與AML\/CFT生態系統中各持份者建立更緊密的合作。其他重點包括透過利用加強的數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，實施更廣泛的風險敏感監管技術，以及推動銀行使用Regtech，包括交易監控系統。\n\n香港金融管理局亦會讓香港政府、銀行及儲值支付工具（SVF）界別緊密合作，新增更新香港洗錢及恐怖分子融資風險評估，並協助業界應對新興風險。亦會繼續理解反覆的洗錢及恐怖分子融資風險，實施反洗錢法例的修改及相關指引以配合國際標準，並維持主動與其他監管機構及國際標準制定機構的溝通。\n\n# 理財及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2022年，香港金融管理局將對授權機構在與財富管理及證券銷售、強制性公積金（MPF）及其他投資及保險產品相關的行為進行現場檢查及非現場監察，重點將放在粵港澳大灣區的跨境理財通計劃、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資掛鉤長期保險產品。\n\n在與其他監管機構及銀行業保持密切聯繫的同時，香港金融管理局將就投資、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）產品的銷售提供進一步的指引。這將涵蓋與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售一種新的投資掛鉤保險計劃產品子集——保護掛鉤計劃，該產品提供高水平的保險保障。香港金融管理局、保險業監理處及強制性公積金計劃管理局將聯同推出神秘購物計劃，以檢查中介機構在銷售合資格延遲年金保險計劃及可扣稅自願供款方面的銷售實踐。\n\n以下暢順推出跨境WMC後，香港金管局將繼續參與業界及相關監管機構，以提升該計劃。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將展開準備工作，以在新SPM模塊和新做法守則之下監管AI的信託業務。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監理\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續推動其監管範圍內金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全與效率，根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）1，以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發布的各種指引。它將在採取最新科技及市場發展考慮的情況下微調FMI監管框架。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將與金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）合作，就其遵守PFMI的情況進行並更新合適的評估。此外，香港金融管理局將繼續參與CPMI-國際證監會組織的PFMI實施監測與評估工作。香港金融管理局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並因應市場及科技發展，按照國際方針加強其監管要求。香港金融管理局將與相關當局合作，在合適的情況下進一步加強協同監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續提升和完善其銀行監管框架和政策，採取國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n#巴塞爾協議在香港的實施\n\n# 資本標準\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續提升資本框架，透過實施近年來由銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）發出的標準，包括以下內容：\n\n2013年12月銀行對基金股權投資的資本要求（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日生效，隨後銀行（資本）（修訂）規則2022在立法會進行負面審議後開始運作。\n\n2017年12月《巴塞爾III最終確定後危機改革》、2019年1月《市場風險最低資本要求》（2019年2月修訂）以及2020年7月《專項修訂信貸估值調整風險架構》，這三項修訂資本標準一般稱為「巴塞爾III最終改革套件」。這些修訂資本標準建立修訂後的信貸風險、市場風險、信貸估值調整（CVA）風險及操作風險的資本處理方式，引入輸出底限要求，並提升槓桿率架構。正在與業界進行諮詢，準備對銀行業（資本）規則（BCR）進行修訂（條文），預計自2023年7月1日起生效（除了市場風險與CVA風險的相關內容）。\n\n鑑於在 Basel 委員會框架下，BCR 對主權集中風險的資本處理旨在補充由銀行業（風險敞口限制）規則實施的大型風險敞口框架，香港金融管理局將同時提出對資本規則的修訂，以及對相關銀行業（風險敞口限制）規則的修改。\n\n# 暴露限值\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續與業界及律政司進行諮詢，就建議修訂《銀行（風險暴露上限）規則》進行工作，目標實施日期將與巴塞爾III最終改革方案的日期相符，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n新或修訂的披露要求，與巴塞爾第三套改革方案最終版本中修訂的資本標準相關，主要由巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發出的《第三支柱披露要求－更新框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》列明。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《槓桿率披露要求修訂》，修訂槓桿率披露要求，以應對有關潛在「粉飾門檻」（即銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易數量，以人為提高其報告及公眾披露的槓桿率）的憂慮。為實施這些新或修訂的披露要求，亦正在準備對《銀行（披露）規則》作出相應修訂，鑑於讓其在香港生效的時序與相關修訂資本標準一致。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求及國際標準的發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）計劃更新某些SPM模組，包括與實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案中修訂的資本及披露標準相關的模組，例如「逆週期資本緩衝 – 其實施方法」、「銀行帳簿中的利率風險」、「新股份認購及股份孖展融資」及「壓力測試」。HKMA亦會繼續就「行為守則」及「根據銀行條例有關獲授權機構外部核數師的報告要求」的修訂SPM模組進行工作，目標是在2022年內完成修訂。根據建議對《銀行（風險暴露上限）規則》作出的修訂，相關的守則及SPM模組，例如CR-G-8「大額風險暴露及風險集中」及CR-G-9「對關聯方的風險暴露」，將會相應更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart

經濟與金融環境\n\n在強勁的商品出口、內需回升以及政府支持性政策措施的推動下，香港經濟於2021年回復正增長，扭轉了2019年及2020年所面臨的收縮局面。勞動市場亦有所改善，通脹仍然保持溫和，雖然有所微升。儘管預期第五波新型冠狀病毒疫情減退後經濟復甦將會繼續，但其強度和速度將受制於不確定因素和風險，尤其是那些造成的疫情以及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑的不確定因素和風險。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 真實活動\n\n由於強勁的貨品出口及改善的內需，香港經濟在2021年增長6.3%，截至2019年和2020年的經濟收縮（表1和圖1）。私人消費復甦，受惠於改善的勞動市場情況及政府消費券計劃1的推動。整體投資開支亦反彈，因營商環境及展望改善2。外圍方面，香港的貨品出口全年錄得強勁增長，部分受惠於全球經濟復甦的持續。服務出口錄得溫和增長，反映區域貿易和貨運流量活躍，以及跨境商業和金融活動增強。總體進口顯著上升，主要由於更大規模的本地及轉口帶動需求。淨基礎而言，外貿對2021年本地生產總值（GDP）增長帶來支持（圖1），因總出口較進口增長較快。\n\n表1

通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力微升，但整體仍屬溫和。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的效應後，經調整的年同比通脹率3逐步上升至12月輕微的1.4%（圖2）4。外出用膳、交通、服裝及衣履等消費品價格重拾上升動力，因本地消費需求改善。進口價格亦因全球供應鏈瓶頸及國際能源和大宗商品價格急升而顯著上升。相反，住房部分拖累整體通脹，反映應屆私人住宅租賃價格早前下跌的傳導效應（圖2）。更廣泛而言，名義工資及商業租賃增長緩慢，有助控制本地企業成本壓力。整體而言，2021年的經調整及整體通脹率5分別維持溫和，為0.6%及1.6%。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價膨脹 來源：人口普查及統計科\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，勞動市場在2021年有所改善。在2月達到17年來高點7.2%後，失業率明顯下跌至12月的4.0%（圖3），且下跌情況橫跨大多數經濟部門。整體勞動需求逐步轉強，反映在總就業人數（圖3）及民間部門職缺數的回升，儘管這些數據仍低於疫情爆發前的峰值。另一方面，與去年同期相比，勞動力在12月略微減少1.3%，部分由於勞動力參與率出現溫和下降。2021年前三個季度，名目工資與勞動收入的年增率雖屬溫和，但顯示出加速跡象，逆轉了2019及2020年的放緩趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞動市場情況 來源：人口普查及統計部門。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n儘管一些主要海外股市持續上漲（圖4），本地股市整體表現呆滯。Hang Seng指數延續2020年底的反彈，於2021年2月17日攀升至31,085點，但自那之後，由於多種因素，包括對新變種新冠病毒的憂慮、主要央行潛在的貨幣政策收緊，以及南向交易下互聯互通7資金流入減少，市場情緒急劇轉為負面。Hang Seng指數全年收報23,398點，較去年同期顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格 資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有有限公司。\n\n# 房地产市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2021年上半年隨着經濟前景改善重拾上升動力，但下半年在資產市場氣氛轉弱的情況下出現整固（圖4）。整體而言，2021年樓價及交易量仍分別錄得3.7%及24.1%的上升。家庭負擔能力亦變得更偏緊，部分反映家庭收入減少。另一方面，在經歷2019年及2020年顯著調整後，非住宅物業市場一般有所改善，工業物業價格及租金一般回升至疫情爆發前的高峰，而零售及辦公室空間則仍低於各自的高峰。\n\n見表B：主要經濟指標，第326至327頁，以獲取更多詳情，包括其在2017至2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n在盡早2022年，本地第五波新型冠狀病毒肺炎感染對國內經濟活動造成了壓力。因應此，政府推出了第五及第六輪的抗疫基金，以及在2022-23年度預算下的增加反週期措施，以協助支持經濟。香港金融管理局（HKMA）與銀行界一同延長了預先批准的本金付款假期計劃至2022年底。\n\n整體而言，2022年的經濟復甦預計將繼續，雖然步伐較2021年更加溫和，部分反映第五波新型冠狀病毒疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、較不有利的基數效應以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年實際本地生產總值增長將介於1%至2%之間，而國際組織和私人部門分析員的最新增長預測平均為1.1%。儘管如此，復甦的強度和步伐仍受制於眾多不確定因素和風險，尤其是與疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑相關的因素。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n隨著進口價格上漲及疫情導致的物流中斷，近期通脹壓力預計將略微上升，但由於租金走軟及輕微的本地勞動成本壓力，通脹應大致受控。市場共識預測2022年 headline 通脹率為2.4%，而政府預測 headline 及 underlying 通脹率將分別為2.1%及2.0%。2022年初本地新型冠狀病毒肺炎感染的第五波疫情，已對勞動市場造成壓力，尤其對接觸密集型行業影響較大。展望未來，勞動市場情況將取決於疫情發展及國內經濟復甦的步驟。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年繼續保持穩定。總體銀行資產適度擴大，貸款和存款均有所上升。銀行業的資本和流動性狀況仍然良好。資產質量維持在歷史和國際標準下的健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2021年增長1.9%。由於經濟復甦，全年總貸款錄得3.8%的增長，相比2020年的1.2%。在總貸款中，用於香港的貸款增長4.4%，用於香港境外的貸款增長1.1%，貿易融資則上升14.2%。與內地相關的貸款在2021年擴大3.6%，而在2020年則大致保持穩定。\n\n在負債方，總存款額於2021年上升4.6%，相比2020年的5.4%。由於總存款以較快的步伐增加，整體貸存比微升至2021年底的71.8%，較一年前的72.3%有所下降（圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行部門的貸款和存款  \n來源：HKMA。\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業仍然保持良好資本化。本地註冊的授權機構（AIs）合併總資本比率在2021年底高達20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖6）。兩項比率均遠高於其分別的國際最低要求8%和6%。\n\n巴塞爾III杠杆率在2021年底為7.9%，良好高於法定最低要求的3%（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性地位良好。第1類機構8於2021年第四季度的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）為151.9%，良好。\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。二類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦高於法定最低要求的25%（圖8）。\n\n圖8 指定授權機構的流動性比率

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管疫情造成的持續不確定性以及對美國貨幣政策收緊步伐的上升憂慮，香港美元匯兌及貨幣市場繼續以暢順有序的方式進行交易。作為自1983年實施以來香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度已展現其應對外部衝擊的強大與韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在外匯市場上對美元的穩定匯率，在7.75至7.85港元對1美元的區間內。貨幣體系的結構主要採用貨幣發行局安排，需要基礎貨幣至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備支持，且基礎貨幣的變動需由相關的美元儲備變動100%配合。\n\n# 貨幣基礎 (表1) 包括：\n\n債務證書，這些證書為三家發行銀行發行的紙幣提供全面支持；政府發行的紙幣和硬幣流通中；總餘額，即存放在香港金融管理局（HKMA）的清算賬戶餘額總和；以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund 證券（EFBNs）。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性是通過自動利率調整機制以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）對履行可兌換承擔（CUs）的堅決承諾來維持的。香港金融管理局準備就緒，當收到要求時，以每美元7.75（或7.85）的匯率，向（或從）銀行賣出（或買入）香港美元以換取美元。當強方（或弱方）CU被觸發時，總餘額將會擴大（或收縮），以促使香港美元利率下降（或上升），這將協助將香港美元重新回到7.75至7.85的可兌換區間之內。\n\n# 2021檢討\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n由於與股權相關的需求產生於融資活動及南向港股通，香港美元在年初時接近強方兌換率。隨後，香港美元在股市修正及部分新上市企業匯回首次公開招股（IPO）資金的影響下轉弱，但在第二季度因企業派息需求及南向港股通的淨流入而略微反彈。踏入年中後，雖然香港美元在股市情緒回軟的影響下走低，但整體仍維持在兌換區強方，並以暢順有序的方式進行交易（圖1）。整體而言，香港美元兌換市場在2021年全年的運作均正常。\n\n圖1 2021年市場匯率\n\n由於CU未被觸發，總外匯基金餘額與未償還的外匯基金債券總額在2021年仍然無大變動，約為港元15,263十億（圖2）。在該年度內，香港金融管理局為滿足銀行對外匯基金紙幣的持續需求，在銀行體系流動性充裕的背景下，發行了總額為港元80十億的增加外匯基金債券，導致總外匯基金餘額由2020年底的港元4575十億收縮至2021年底的港元3775十億。\n\n反映因應發行額外的儲備銀行紙幣及發行EFBNs以吸納EFBNs的利息支付，按照設立的慣例，未償還的EFBNs在當年從港元1,0692十億上升至港元1,1488十億。貨幣基礎整體仍然由外匯儲備十足支持。\n\n#15,263十億港元\n\n總計總餘額及未償還的EFBNs\n\n圖2 總餘額（貼現窗口前）及2021年未償還外匯基金證券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在總餘額規模較大的情況下，港元銀行間利率全年大致穩定於低水平（圖3）。雖然首個季度隨首次公開招股活動的增加，港元銀行間拆借利率（HIBORs）各種期限的利率波動不大。此後，儘管存在對美國貨幣政策收緊步伐的憂慮，HIBORs仍大致穩定。接近2021年底時，HIBORs出現輕微上升，部分反映預期年底資金需求。在零售方面，銀行保持其最佳貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借款從2020年的9.1十億港元減少至2021年的6.8十億港元。\n\n圖3：2021年香港美元銀行間利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）已成為香港金融體系逾三十年來的強大支柱，並展現出應對挑戰的堅韌與強大。儘管圍繞全球經濟復甦仍存在持續的不確定性，港元匯兌及貨幣市場仍繼續以有序的方式運作，反映聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。特區政府堅決致力於聯繫匯率制度。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年外匯部門報告中再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信度已透過一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強化的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體制以及謹慎的財政框架得到保障。\n\n一個具有良好表現的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業繼續順利營運，流動性狀況和資本充足率按國際標準表現非常良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直緊密監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管努力。\n\n為優化貨幣基金會賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月以來，已配置特定部分的外匯基金資產以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產分為貨幣基礎）在2021年期間上落於109.8%至110.5%的範圍內，未觸及上界或下界觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報110.2%（圖4）。根據LERS，在特定外匯基金資產已指定用於支持組合的同時，所有外匯基金資產均可獲得以支持港元匯率。外匯基金充裕的財務資源，連同健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定性提供強大的後盾。\n\n圖4 2021年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣委員會委員會\n\n香港金融管理局貨幣發行委員會（CBC）是外匯基金諮詢委員會下屬的貨幣發行委員會，負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2021年，CBC探討的議題包括評估美國通脹情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估縮減購債規模所引發的風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解與內地相關的資金流動對香港貨幣狀況的影響。有關這些議題的討論紀錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣發行委員會運作報告，已發佈於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 紙幣和硬幣\n\n2021年底，發鈔銀行發行並在流通中的紙幣總值為5,926億港元，較一年前上升5.9%（圖5、6和7）。2021年底，政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中的總值為129億港元，同比上升1.7%（圖8和9）。\n\n# 港元5,926十億，+5.9%\n\n由發行紙幣的銀行發行的紙幣總價值\n\n# 129億港元，+1.7%\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣的總價值\n\n# 圖

硬幣收數計劃\n\n硬幣收數計劃繼續受到良好歡迎。有關該計劃的更多資料可載於《可持續發展》章節第198頁。\n\n# 交易所基金票據及債券\n\nEFBN計劃繼續順利營運。為滿足銀行對外匯基金紙幣的持續需求，隨着銀行體系流動性的充裕，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在2021年下半年發行了總額為800億港元的額外外匯基金債券。額外發行令總餘額相應減少。截至2021年底，未償還外匯基金紙幣的名義金額高達1,1486億港元（表2）。\n\n表2 兌換基金票據及債券未解決事項\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港貨幣與金融研究機構（HKIMR）儘管面對持續的疫情，在2021年維持穩定的研究成果。在該年度內，HKIMR 發布了30篇工作論文，並舉辦了9場網絡研討會，涵蓋廣泛的主題，包括貨幣政策、銀行業穩定性、市場微結構及金融科技（fintech）發展。HKIMR 亦舉辦了一場國際會議及一場混合模式的網絡研討會。\n\n題為「人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望」的網絡研討會，於8月17日與香港金融學院合辦。該研討會在多個在線平台上進行直播，總計吸引超過116萬即時觀看量。\n\n第11屆國際中國經濟會議，題為《邁向共同富裕：中國雙循環經濟發展》，於11月11日舉行。會議討論了與共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷法規、房地產市場、跨境理財通及大灣區金融發展相關的最新政策動向。專家演講者亦深入分析了人口老齡化對社會保障基金可持續性的影響，以及中國對全球金融穩定與世界經濟的貢獻。會議的六場不同場次吸引了超過3,200名線上及現場觀眾，總觀看量達5,900次。\n\n"}

Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2021年仍然保持穩健和穩定，儘管出現了更具傳染性的新型冠狀病毒變異株，導致全球經濟復甦不確定。在這一年中，香港金融管理局繼續將重點放在對授權機構風險管理的監管上。鑑於銀行業面臨持續增加的網絡威脅以及數字化進程加快，對授權機構運營和網絡韌性的監管也得到了加強。\n\n在監管工作方面，香港金融管理局向銀行提供指引，以促進使用非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，制定針對市場上新產品（如保險掛鉤證券及虛擬資產）的監管要求。《銀行業守則》亦經修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）範疇，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的工作重點是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中作為龍門的角色及其防止及偵測與疫情期間網上詐騙、洗錢馬車賬戶網絡及其他金融罪行增加有關的非法資金流動的能力。為提升客戶帳戶對詐騙及金融罪行的保障，香港金融管理局透過公私合營模式深化與其他持份者的合作與資訊共享。在支持遠程客戶開戶的同時，香港金融管理局亦透過於11月推出首個AML Regtech實驗室，鼓勵採用包括網絡分析在內的其他科技。國際上，香港金融管理局透過主動參與，持續在全球金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的AML\/CFT工作中保持領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通試點計劃於9月順利推出。當年，香港金融管理局繼續執行其推動香港監管科技應用的兩年路線圖。為銀行氣候風險管理奠定基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色及可持續銀行業務，推出了若干措施，如可持續發展章節所討論的內容。亦在軟性基礎設施方面作出進一步努力，包括推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出能力建設計劃，以促進人才發展。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已與銀行業緊密合作，以優化監管政策和流程。在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露要求等。香港金融管理局繼續推進其工作，以確保授權機構具公信力的處置機制，包括發展新的處置標準及實施對吸收損失能力的要求規則，以提升授權機構的處置能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局有一個總體目標，即推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現這一目標取決於一個高度具彈性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可透過其經營業務的方式影響系統的穩定性，並在極端情況下以失序方式倒閉。貨幣當局作為監管機構，透過確保銀行能抵禦衝擊並在危機中恢復其地位，從而發揮關鍵作用，最終幫助防止倒閉。貨幣當局負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責香港持牌銀行、限制性牌照銀行及接受存款公司等獲授權機構（AIs）的授權，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法確保，香港審慎監管框架也並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣當局作為解決機構，力求在認可機構變得不可行的事件中，以有序方式管理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局是認可機構等其他類型機構的解決機構。為在香港落實解決機制，制定解決規則和政策標準至關重要，需進行解決規劃以消除阻礙認可機構可解決性的障礙，並發展香港金融管理局解決失敗認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行這些工作，香港金融管理局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n貨幣當局亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。在監督FMIs時，香港金融管理局的目標是推動其整體安全與效率，限制系統性風險並促進透明度。使FMIs更能抵禦金融危機，可保護香港的貨幣及金融系統免受FMIs中斷所引致的可能破壞性效應。有關香港金融管理局監督方法的資訊，可於香港金融管理局網站上獲取。\n\n# 2021檢討\n\n# 授權\n\n2021年底，香港有：\n\n在年內，香港金融管理局授予三間非本地銀行兩項銀行牌照及一項受限銀行牌照。香港金融管理局亦向一家外國交易平台營運商授予貨幣經紀批核。年內，三間持牌銀行及兩間受限牌照銀行的授權遭撤銷。\n\n有關AIs及香港當地代表辦事處的更多資料載於附錄及表D至F，分別見第321至324頁及330至333頁。\n\n# 簡介監督活動\n\n香港金融管理局進行了189項非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛範圍的問題，包括CAMEL評分評估1、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技（fintech）策略。作為香港金融管理局持續推動更強風險治理的一部分，與銀行的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會級委員會舉辦了40場會議。另外，進一步在港銀監、銀行及他們的外部審計師之間舉辦了38場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了定期現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為風險較高範疇的主題性審查。當年共進行了679項現場檢查及主題性審查，信貸風險管理為重點。隨着銀行日益採用科技，營運風險及科技風險的管理亦為另一主要關注範疇。香港金融管理局亦增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場檢查及主題性審查數目。此外，專門團隊亦進行針對持牌機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務活動，以及其反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施的現場檢查及主題性審查。表1載有香港金融管理局2021年的監管活動概要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款額在2021年上升了3.8%，相比2020年1.2%的增長率。表2顯示貸款和推進的增長分類。\n\n內地相關貸款在2021年上升3.6%，達到47,250港元（表3）。\n\n銀行業的資產品質在本年度仍然大致穩定，並符合歷史及國際標準的良好水平。業界分類貸款比率在2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。與內地相關貸款的比率亦從一年前的0.96%下降至0.86%。\n\n在本年度內，新型冠狀病毒肺炎疫情持續對經濟部分領域造成影響，同時內地房地產行業的信貸事件也引起市場關注。香港金融管理局加強了監管的廣度和深度，深入審視銀行對高槓桿借款人敞口的情況。與銀行保持密切聯繫，以促進對經濟和市場發展影響以及銀行風險管理措施充分性的即時評估。整體而言，銀行業面臨的信貸風險被評估為可控。香港金融管理局最新壓力測試結果顯示，銀行業持續維持足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端壓力。\n\n本年內進行專項及主題性檢查，以評估AIs在貸款分類及貸款損失準備、海外貸款業務，以及向私人銀行及財富管理客戶提供擔保貸款方面的系統與控制措施。\n\n# 紓緩客戶所面臨的資金周轉壓力\n\n在香港金融管理局及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制於9月公布將預先批准的本金支付假期計劃延長6個月至2022年4月底。此計劃首個於2020年5月推出，用以延後合資格企業客戶的貸款本金支付6個月。鑑於本地新型冠狀病毒疫情反彈，於2022年2月進一步將該計劃延長至2022年10月底。此外，該計劃亦加強提供1年期部分本金還款選項，供金融上具備能力且願意逐步恢復本金還款的客戶選擇。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准逾83,000個案的貸款期限延長及其他形式的緩濟，涉及總金額逾港幣9,200億元。針對個人客戶，銀行已批准逾52,000個案的住宅按揭貸款及其他個人緩濟貸款的本金寬限期，金額逾港幣530億元。\n\n# 房地产抵押貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）推出的多輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，已轉強銀行的風險管理及銀行業對本地樓市可能突然下行的韌性。2021年12月批准的新住宅按揭貸款（RMLs）平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）為53%，相比2009年9月逆週期措施首個推出前的64%。2021年12月新按揭貸款的平均還款比率（DSR）仍然低至36%，相比2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及技術風險\n\n鑑於銀行對技術的依賴不斷增加，香港金融管理局加強了對運營和技術風險的監管。本年度的重點監管內容包括對雲端外包和遠程工作安排的控制。香港金融管理局於12月推出了一項行業諮詢，針對一份關於「運營韌性」的新監管政策手冊（SPM）模塊草案。新SPM模塊旨在為銀行提供指引，協助其發展一個全面且綜合的運營韌性框架。\n\n香港金管局於1月推出了《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》，以反映最新的網絡安全風險管理最佳實踐。在本年度內，香港金管局監察了持牌機構對《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》的實施情況，並審視了其網絡韌性能力。鑑於破壞性網絡攻擊的風險越來越高，香港金管局於5月要求所有持牌機構根據香港銀行公會（HKAB）發佈的《安全第三級數據備份指引》，嚴肅評估是否需要進行安全的第三級數據備份。\n\n因應風險升高及釣魚攻擊數字上升，香港金融管理局（HKMA）與業界緊密合作，加強網際網路和移動銀行服務的安全性。一個大規模的香港金融管理局與香港銀行公會共同舉辦的公眾意識活動，主題為「保障您的個人數字密鑰；提防詐騙連結！」，於7月開始（圖示1）。\n\n圖示

流動性及市場風險\n\n為提升對AI流動性風險敞口的監測，香港金融管理局（HKMA）推出了增加的情境至其流動性壓力測試架構，以評估AI在持續一段較長時間內應對流動性衝擊的能力。\n\n在年內，進行了主題審查，以評估AIs流動性壓力測試計劃的充足程度，並評估其監控指標和控制限值在管理流動性風險方面的充分性。香港金融管理局亦進行了審查，以評估AIs在債券投資市場風險管理架構的有效性，以及對財務活動的操作控制。\n\n香港金融管理局緊密監察授權機構準備過渡離開倫敦銀行同業拆息率（LIBOR）的進展。其與業內公會合作，開發工具協助授權機構支持客戶遷移至替代參考利率，包括一份提升企業對過渡事宜意識的傳單，以及一份關於貸款市場中可用於代替美元LIBOR選項的信息附註。授權機構已大幅修訂涉及LIBOR設置的合約，這些設置自2021年底起停止發出。他們被提醒自2022年1月1日起不得簽訂新的LIBOR合約。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms)

國際金融中心\n\n在2021年期間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）透過多管齊下的方法，達致良好進展，加強香港作為全球競爭力國際金融中心的地位。\n\n香港金管局揭曉「金融科技2025」戰略，以推動金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並更大致地鞏固香港作為金融科技中心的地位。在較快支付系統方面，其交易額在當年新型冠狀病毒疫情期間急升。\n\n在增強連接性方面，本年內取得重大進展，此外新增了跨境理財通及債券通下的南向交易，進一步豐富了連接計劃的範疇。受惠於其世界一流的市場基礎設施及連接計劃，香港成為內地資金挖掘全球市場的首選平台，亦是國際投資者進入快速發展的內地市場的重要渠道。\n\n亦在2021年期間，香港金管局致力投入大量資源締造新業務機會，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，範疇包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心，以及綠色及可持續金融。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性，以及其所帶來的機遇。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局積極參與國際及區域的中央銀行和監管機構論壇，為全球維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展作出貢獻。\n\n# 簡介\n\n香港金融管理局公布其「Fintech 2025」策略，涵蓋一連串措施，以推動廣泛採用金融科技（fintech），並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門一同發揮了關鍵作用，推動各種關鍵措施，包括以下內容：\n\n- 推動監管科技（Regtech）的採用  \n- 推出科技基準評估，以了解銀行採用金融科技的情況\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位仍然堅決，離岸人民幣業務在本年登記良好增長。人民幣資產的流入繼續收集步伐，因為境內證券納入主要金融市場指數的進程持續。香港在促進國際投資者增加配置人民幣資產方面發揮不可或缺的作用，內地-香港聯繫方案被廣泛接受為國際投資者進入境內資本市場的首選渠道。2021年，北向通債券聯繫的每日成交額上升34%，達到約人民幣258億元。\n\n在北向債券通成功之後，南向債券通於9月推出，完善了內地與國際債券市場之間的兩向連接。同年同月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）、香港金融管理局（HKMA）及澳門金融管理局公布了粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通（Crossboundary WMC）方案的實施細則。10月，香港合資格銀行開始與內地合作銀行一同提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為關鍵離岸人民幣中心的地位，一個由香港金融管理局（HKMA）、證券及期貨事務監理委員會（SFC）及香港交易及結算所有有限公司（HKEX）組成的工作小組成為進行有關推動在香港交易以人民幣計價的股本證券的可行性研究。亦於12月由人民銀行（PBoC）與香港金融管理局（HKMA）合辦了一個聯合研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領導地位的人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續作出進展，接近加強香港金融平台競爭力的目標。特別是，為提升香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業緊密合作，提供更有利於基金設立的稅務和監管環境。亦在進一步提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心和債券發行中心的地位方面取得重大進展。同時，香港金融管理局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推動香港的金融服務。\n\n確保金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作，對強化香港作為領導國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2021年，四個銀行間即時全額結算系統（RTGS）、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易存管處達致系統可用率100%，超越99.95%的目標。在9月推出南向債券通後，CMU成為北向通及南向債券通下進行交易的結算及托管服務提供者。\n\nFPS的採用在2021年繼續擴大。至2021年底，註冊數目增長至960百萬，而該年每日平均交易額較2020年上升了90%。FPS用於結清政府賬單、進行商戶支付以及為儲值設施（SVF）電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值的使用增加，成為交易量持續上升的主要推動力，加上個人對個人及商業支付的穩定增長。\n\n為推動本地零售支付業的安全及效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）負責監察六個指定的零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監管15間持牌儲值支付工具營運商。在本年度內，香港金融管理局透過協調及推動相關政府部門與為該計劃委任的儲值支付工具營運商之間的對話與合作，促成了政府消費券計劃的暢順實施。\n\n在2022年1月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）發佈了一份關於加密資產和穩定幣的討論文件，闡述HKMA對相關監管方法的思考，並邀請持份者提供觀看量。在制定合適的監管制度時，將會考慮到相關因素，包括對這份討論文件的回饋以及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局（HKMA）是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。例如，HKMA 主席東亞及太平洋中央銀行高級管理層會議（EMEAP）下設的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）2。HKMA 亦聯席主席巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（Basel Committee）的政策與標準小組、非銀行監測專家小組，以及金融穩定委員會（FSB）的金融創新網絡，並促使一個團隊研究與金融基准轉換相關的監理問題。\n\n# 2021檢討\n\n#香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n香港金管局於6月公布其「Fintech 2025」策略，以帶動香港金融科技的發展。該策略的目標是鼓勵金融業於2025年前全面應用科技，同時推動提供公平且高效的金融服務，以造福香港市民及經濟。該策略的五個重點範疇為：\n\n- 所有銀行進行金融科技  \n- 加深研究香港以應對數字貨幣  \n- 締造下一代數據基礎設施  \n- 擴展具備金融科技知識的員工隊伍  \n- 以資金和政策培育生態系統\n\n香港金融管理局的「Fintech 2025」戰略推動香港的金融科技發展\n\n# 金融科技在銀行業的採用\n\n為支持「Fintech 2025」戰略中「所有銀行進行金融科技」的倡議，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2021年6月推出了「Tech Baseline Assessment」。這項評估的目標是協助香港金融管理局（HKMA）更深入了解銀行業當前的金融科技環境，並識別哪些金融科技範疇可能需要香港金融管理局的支援。所有在香港有重要業務的持牌銀行均被要求於2021年底之前制定一份三年的金融科技採用計劃。\n\n在本年度，香港金融管理局亦繼續實施其兩年路線圖，以推動香港銀行業採用Regtech，並在其監管過程中融入科技，以優化效率和效果。見到銀行業穩定性章節第98頁以獲取更多詳情。\n\n# 批發中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局與泰國央行於2021年2月擴大了其聯合研究計劃的範圍，阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行與人民銀行數位貨幣研究所加入其中。該項目被重新命名為「多央行數位貨幣橋（mBridge）」，並獲得香港國際清算銀行（BIS）創新中心的大力支持。該項目進一步探討分布式分類帳技術在多司法管轄區環境下，以24小時營運的基礎上促進即時跨境外匯支付對支付（PvP）交易的能力。一份聯合報告於9月發出，以提供中期結果，隨後於11月發佈潛力使用個案與未來路線圖。\n\n# 零售中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在CBDC準備方面具備前瞻性，香港金管局開始進行一項研究，探討在香港發行零售CBDC的前景，即e-HKD，涵蓋技術和政策方面的考量。與香港BIS創新中心合作，香港金管局踏上了一項名為Project Aurum的研究，以探討發行零售CBDC的技術方面。此外，香港金管局成立了跨部門內部工作小組，研究相關的技術、政策和法律問題。在10月，香港金管局發布了一份技術白皮書，題為《e-HKD：技術觀點》，以探討並邀請對發行和分銷零售CBDC的潛在技術設計選項提出意見。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局支持人民銀行數字貨幣研究所進行技術測試，以測試使用數字人民幣進行跨境支付。這將有助推動粵港澳大灣區的互聯互通，並透過增強跨境支付的效率和用戶經驗，為香港和內地旅客帶來更大便利。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n7月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行和SVF營運商加入CDI，這是一個旨在促進銀行體系內更高效金融中介的下一代金融數據基礎設施。為進一步促進其發展與應用，研討會期間公布了CDI創新中心的推出。為促進中小企業融資，HKMA完成了兩階段的概念驗證研究，檢驗CDI的技術可行性。研究期間，參與銀行透過應用替代數據以協助信貸評估和貸款承銷，共批准了超過550筆中小企業貸款，總額超過港元9億。基於鼓勵的結果，HKMA於11月宣布了CDI的試點推出。\n\n中小企業主讚揚CDI簡化了他們的貸款申請\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange

備付金管理\n\n全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑。儘管全球經濟持續受反覆的新型冠狀病毒疫情所影響，但多項因素，包括疫苗接種率增加，以及全球寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施，帶來支持，有助全球經濟和金融市場顯著復甦。在此背景下，多個海外股市於當年錄得歷史新高，而儲備基金的整體股權持倉，儘管香港股市表現呆滯，仍能取得不俗回報。2021年，儲備基金錄得1,919億港元的投資收入，相當於4.1%的投資回報。\n\n# 兌換基金\n\n根據《儲備基金條例》規定，儲備基金的首要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可運用以維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定性及完整性，協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局在財政司司長轉授的權力範圍內，並按照轉授條款，就儲備基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\nExchange Fund 資詢委員會 (EFAC) 已為 Exchange Fund 建立以下投資目標：\n\n（i）保障資本；  \n（ii）確保貨幣基礎在任何時候都由高度流通性的美元資產十足支持；  \n（iii）確保有足夠流動性可獲得，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及  \n（iv）受制於（i）至（iii），爭取投資回報以協助維持 Exchange Fund 的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標推行全面考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並已註冊於基金的投資組合結構及目標資產組合（圖示1）中。\n\n圖示1 交易所基金組合分離\n\n大致來說，儲備基金擁有兩大主要組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合舉辦高流通性美元資產，以提供貨幣基礎所需的全面支持，符合貨幣委員會的安排。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作發展機構成員經濟體的債券及股票市場，以保障其資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以謹慎及漸進的方式，將香港外匯基金的部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票在IP下舉辦，而私募股權及房地產投資則在長期增長組合（LTGP）下舉辦。自LTGP成立以來，香港金融管理局已訂下上限1，以指引分散投資至LTGP的步驟。隨著LTGP在投資規模及資產多樣性方面日趨成熟，外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）於2022年1月決定，以目標資產配置代替上限，該目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置同時制定，並受穩健風險管理原則所限制。\n\n戰略組合於2007年設立，舉辦香港交易及結算所有有限公司的股份，這些股份由政府為基金的戰略目的而購入。由於其獨特性質，戰略組合未被包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 存款與匯換基金\n\n匯兌基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP2的表現掛鉤，主要個別例子是未來基金3，其利率根據投資組合比例與IP和LTGP的回報掛鉤。在2021年，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40：60。\n\n# 投資過程\n\n香港儲備基金的投資過程由兩種類型的資產配置決策所支撐：戰略性資產配置與戰術性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑑於香港儲備基金的投資目標而制定的長期資產配置。在戰略性配置的指引下，資產會以戰術性方式配置，以爭取超越基準的超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準及循跡誤差4的限制是由財政司長與儲備基金管理委員會（EFAC）諮詢後制定，但戰術性決策及戰術偏離的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據轉授權力作出及建立。在戰術偏離的容許範圍內，投資組合經理可能採取立場以利用短期市場走勢（圖示2）。\n\n圖示2 儲備基金的資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的外匯基金投資辦公室設有其投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的職員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括全部的BP及IP的其中一章。這部分IP包括建立於全球固定收益市場的一組投資組合，以及各種衍生工具對沖投資組合，用以實施為基金制定的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）僱用外部基金經理來管理約29%的儲備基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外部經理的目的是挖掘市場中可獲得的最佳投資專長，以獲取可持續的回報，汲取多樣化且互補的投資方式，並獲得市場見解和技術專長。\n\n與使用外部管理人有關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本以及扣留稅和其他稅收。該支出主要由市場因素制定，可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的複雜性越來越凸顯風險管理的重要性。香港金融管理局為內部及外部管理的投資組合制定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並確保有嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。為實施有效的風險管理及與投資相關活動的治理，已設有三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及操作風險）會定期監測，而風險管理過程則提供一個良好的框架，以支持戰略規劃和投資多元化。\n\n# 負責任的投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）認為，透過在負責任的投資及可持續的長期經濟表現方面設立適當的重視，可更好達成儲備基金的投資目標，並減低與其基礎投資所涉及的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關事項的風險。HKMA支持負責任的投資，方法是將ESG因素併入儲備基金公眾及私營市場投資的投資流程，並基於指導原則，即若長期風險調整後回報與其他投資相若，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。如欲了解更多有關HKMA負責任投資架構及落實情況的資料，請參閱《可持續發展》章節第184至191頁。\n\n# 外匯基金績效\n\n# 2021年的金融市場\n\n全球股市急劇上升並創下新高，這是在極為寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施推動下，加速了全球經濟和金融市場的復甦。然而，隨着市場改革的推進，香港及內地股市表現遜色。美國標準普爾500指數上漲27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌14%。\n\n對債券市場而言，上升的通貨膨脹預期及美國聯邦準備系統（Fed）縮減資產購買，造成美國國債收益率上升及債券價格下跌，這在2021年期間特別明顯。10年期美國國債收益率從年初的0.9%上升約60個基點，至年底達到1.5%。\n\n在貨幣市場中，美元對其他主要貨幣轉強，尤其在2021年底時，因預期聯邦儲備系統縮減步伐的背景下。特別是歐元和日圓對美元分別貶值7.1%和10.3%。\n\n2021年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現展現在表1中。\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n香港儲備基金在2021年錄得投資收入港幣1,919億元。這包括債券收益港幣126億元，股票淨收益港幣478億元（其中來自外國股票的收益為港幣688億元，來自香港股票的虧損為港幣210億元），對非港元資產產生正貨幣翻譯效果港幣168億元，以及基金投資控股子公司舉辦的其他投資收益港幣1,147億元。此外，戰略組合錄得評估收益港幣31億元。\n\n香港儲備基金的總資產在年底達到45,702十億港元。LTGP的投資市場價值總值為5,153十億港元，其中私人股權總值為3,925十億港元，房地產總值為1,228十億港元。LTGP的未償還投資承諾總值為2,257十億港元。\n\n2021年，不包括戰略組合在內，滙豐基金的投資回報率為4.1%。具體而言，IP達致3.7%的回報率，而BP則錄得0.4%的回報。自2009年成立以來，LTGP錄得年化內部回報率為15.4%。\n\n自1994年至2021年的基金年度回報已建立於圖1中。表2顯示2021年的投資回報及基金在若干不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。2019至2021年的平均回報為5.3%，2017至2021年為4.7%，2012至2021年為3.3%，自1994年以來則為4.8%。表3顯示2021年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n見到第211至319頁以查看交易所基金經審計的2021年財務報表。\n"}

A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"developing":["發展"],"function":["職能"],"particular":["特別"],"9.6":["960"],"strong":["強"],"27":["27"],"highly":["高度"],"students":["學生"],"seize":["把握"],"use":["使用"],"co-ordinates":["統籌"],"safeguard":["保障"],"second":["第二"],"launch":["推出"],"’":[""],"maintain":["維持"],"relate":["有關"],"dedicated":["致力於"],"face":["面對"],"talk":["介紹"],"enhance":["提升"],"lingering":["持續的"],"recommendations":["建議"],"built":["建立"],"42":["42"],"maintaining":["維持"],"areas":["範疇"],"flexible":["靈活"],"serving":["服務"],"comprises":["包括"],"grow":["增長"],"began":["開始"],"sharp":["顯著"],"turn":["轉變"],"allowing":["讓"],"2017":["2017"],"participating":["參與"],"well":["良好"],"strengthening":["加強"],"aspects":["方面"],"outbreak":["爆發"],"adhere":["恪守"],"knowledge":["知識"],"based":["以⋯⋯為基礎"],"billion":["十億"],"track":["軌道"],"end":["年底"],"rougher":["崎嶇"],"get":["變得"],"lent":["提供"],"substantial":["大量"],"payment-related":["用作支付用途的"],"Looking":["展望"],"191.9":["1,919"],"December":["12月"],"mean":["意思是"],"mobilising":["引導"],"base":["基礎"],"brought":["帶來"],"need":["需要"],"Subsequently":["其後"],"Finally":["最後"],"seeking":["尋求"],"rollout":["推出"],"governments":["政府"],"mainly":["主要"],"double-digit":["雙位數"],"reduction":["減少"],"continue":["繼續"],"cement":["鞏固"],"entered":["踏入"],"demonstrated":["顯示"],"volatile":["波動"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"providing":["提供"],"benefitting":["受惠"],"also":["亦"],"capture":["把握"],"premature":["過早"],"adding":["加上"],"tough":["艱難"],"committed":["致力"],"faring":["表現"],"aspires":["旨在"],"status":["地位"],"managing":["管理"],"parts":["部分"],"better":["更好"],"first":["首個"],"recovery":["復甦"],"equivalent":["等值"],"namely":["即"],"deteriorated":["惡化"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"4.1":["4.1"],"invite":["邀請"],"Despite":["儘管"],"severe":["嚴重"],"discussion":["討論"],"must":["必須"],"relevant":["相關"],"Meanwhile":["另一方面"],"successful":["成功"],"goes":["有云"],"marks":["標誌"],"increased":["上升"],"see":["見到"],"2050":["2050"],"solid":["穩健"],"past":["過去"],"together":["一同"],"real-time":["即時"],"formulated":["制定"],"pleased":["高興"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"Although":["儘管"],"90":["九成"],"effectively":["有效"],"maintained":["維持"],"ready":["準備就緒"],"vibrancy":["活力"],"years":["年"],"contraction":["收縮"],"point":["指出"],"may":["可能"],"changed":["改變"],"intensification":["升溫"],"prudently":["審慎"],"RMB26":["260億元人民幣"],"traded":["成交"],"increase":["上升"],"tap":["挖掘"],"two":["兩"],"year":["年"],"introduced":["推出"],"recover":["恢復"],"aligning":["呼應"],"groom":["培育"],"151.9":["151.9"],"journey":["旅程"],"future":["未來"],"adopting":["採納"],"set":["建立"],"continued":["繼續"],"increasingly":["日益"],"practical":["實用"],"go":["進行"],"pace":["步伐"],"launched":["推出"],"activity":["活動"],"emergence":["出現"],"extended":["延長"],"published":["發出"],"months":["個月"],"dominant":["主導"],"meeting":["滿足"],"established":["設立"],"throughout":["全"],"enhancing":["增強"],"Tackling":["處理"],"tCO2e\/US":["tCO2e"],"formulate":["制定"],"watch":["留意"],"series":["連串"],"strengthen":["加強"],"achieved":["達致"],"grew":["增長"],"promote":["推動"],"always":["一如既往"],"establishment":["設立"],"hard-pressed":["經營環境艱難"],"pressure":["壓力"],"five":["五"],"require":["需要"],"manage":["管理"],"87":["87%"],"enter":["進入"],"recorded":["錄得"],"revised":["修訂"],"power":["力量"],"cover":["涵蓋"],"trials":["測試"],"facilitate":["促進"],"closely":["緊密"],"concurrent":["同時"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"share":["分享"],"time":["時"],"tackle":["應對"],"guidance":["指引"],"degree":["程度"],"colleagues":["同事"],"reaching":["達到"],"quote":["舉例"],"diversifying":["多元化"],"50":["50"],"across":["橫跨"],"number":["數目"],"15.4":["15.4"],"covering":["涵蓋"],"cash-flow":["資金周轉"],"path":["路徑"],"resources":["資源"],"invest":["投資"],"organisation":["機構"],"outside":["境外"],"leveraging":["利用"],"twice":["兩度"],"six":["6"],"Besides":["此外"],"million":["百萬"],"numerous":["無數"],"completing":["完善"],"timely":["及時"],"capitalise":["把握"],"reaffirming":["重申"],"supporting":["支持"],"taking":["採取"],"feedback":["回饋"],"latter":["後者"],"ever":["曾"],"appropriate":["合適"],"fourfold":["四倍"],"facing":["面對"],"ultimately":["最終"],"comprehensively":["全面"],"kinds":["類"],"us":["我們"],"overnight":["一朝一夕"],"reflecting":["反映"],"reached":["達到"],"principle":["原則"],"testament":["見證"],"essentially":["本質上"],"including":["包括"],"developmental":["發展的"],"develop":["制訂"],"joined":["攜手"],"achievements":["成果"],"room":["空間"],"levels":["層面"],"help":["協助"],"vision":["願景"],"robustness":["穩健"],"recognising":["鑑於"],"quarter":["季度"],"proactive":["主動"],"city":["城市"],"helping":["幫助"],"assured":["保障"],"cycle":["循環"],"1983":["1983"],"128":["128"],"arising":["產生"],"adopt":["應用"],"huge":["巨大"],"milestone":["里程碑"],"worse":["惡化"],"prospect":["前景"],"spectrum":["範疇"],"disclose":["披露"],"grown":["發展"],"resurgence":["反彈"],"purchasing":["購買力"],"virtuous":["生生不息"],"footing":["基礎"],"start":["開始"],"still":["仍"],"connect":["聯繫"],"offers":["提供"],"ensure":["確保"],"fact":["事實"],"conviction":["信心"],"forefront":["領先"],"leveraged":["借助"],"attract":["吸引"],"jurisdiction":["地區"],"Enhancing":["提升"],"position":["地位"],"rise":["上升"],"totalling":["總額達"],"underpinned":["支撐"],"crucial":["至關重要"],"jointly":["聯同"],"generated

社區參與與公眾教育\n\n為讓社區了解香港金融管理局（HKMA）的工作並提升公眾意識，自1998年以來一直運行著一個公眾教育計劃。2021年，為來自84間中學的2,300多名學生和教師舉辦了一場網上研討會。該網上研討會涵蓋了香港金融管理局的工作簡介、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字密鑰的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的事業機會。截至目前為止，已有超過63,000人參與了該公眾教育計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）教育並聯繫公眾，如何成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙的上升，HKMA進行了一項主題為「保障個人數字金鑰；提防詐騙連結！」的公眾意識運動，透過跨媒體推廣，呼籲公眾對嵌入手機短訊及電子郵件中的詐騙超連結保持警惕，這些連結聲稱來自銀行。\n\n跨媒體推廣提醒公眾提防詐騙連結\n\n香港金管局亦致力提升公眾對金融業的認識，並提升年輕一代投身金融業事業的興趣。在2020年線上劇集《STEPS》獲得正向回饋後，金管局推出新系列《中央人才四面觀》，聚焦金融業四個越來越重要的範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色與可持續金融，以及財富管理。在該視頻系列中，市場從業人員的角色以幽默的方式被描劃，資深業界人士與年輕人才分享了上述四個範疇中工作的性質與要求、事業機會與前景的第一手資訊。\n\n「中央人才四面孔」連串保持年輕一代了解金融市場中的事業機會。\n\n「網上親職與教育運動」於2020年推出，並在2021年MarketingInteractive的「最佳活動——企業社會責任」類別中確認獲得銀獎。基於運動的成功並延續動力，香港按揭證券有限公司推出了增加的倡議，包括親職財務教育工作坊，其中兒童教育專家分享了如何教孩子良好財務意義的技巧，並展示了DIY（自製）財務教育玩具，以及HKMA資訊中心的動畫虛擬導覽。\n\n「線上親職與教育活動」在2021年市場活動獎中獲得獎項。該活動推動財務管理的概念和技能，讓父母和孩子以輕鬆有趣的方式學習。\n\n為提升中學生的金融理財知識，香港金管局與各種持份者合辦了「香港金融理財知識錦標賽」，該賽事以金融科技為主題。除了網上測驗外，新增了有關個人財務管理的新財務設計思維工作坊，以培訓參與學生就理財工具制訂創新方案。此項計劃獲得了教育局轄下校企合作計劃頒發的「學生參與率最高獎項」，以及投資者及金融教育委員會（IFEC）頒發的「投資者及金融教育獎（企業組）——金獎」。\n\n「香港金融理財知識大賽」教育學生關於金融科技與設計思維的概念，並使參與人數創新高。\n\n其他社區參與計劃包括為學生和退休人士舉辦的講座或網絡研討會。香港金管局亦參與了由教育局舉辦的關於經濟安全的老師培訓網絡研討會。提供關於如何使用自動櫃員機（ATM）的精明技巧的在線教育材料，以八種語言3提供，以滿足在香港生活著不同背景人士的需求。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）支持國際金融教育聯盟（IFEC）推動香港的金融理財知識及能力，並會與持份者探討進一步合作，以最大化社區參與的影響。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高透明度，香港金融管理局採納適用於中央銀行業務的國際財務披露標準。這些標準包括香港財務報告標準及其他適用的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特殊數據發布標準。財務部門與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告標準準備並呈報儲備基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦在其年度報告中，對廣泛範圍的費用項目及預算資訊提供詳細披露及深入分析。\n\n# 問責性與控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）最重要的工作之一是管理貨幣和銀行體系的風險。風險管理既在日常運作的基層層面推行，也在戰略規劃的高層次層面進行。根據香港金融管理局的風險管理架構，設有兩個高層次委員會——宏觀監測委員會和風險委員會——兩者均由香港金融管理局局長擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監督委員會的條款為：\n\n識別香港貨幣及金融體系可能面臨的風險和威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可行措施；檢討現有管理貨幣及金融體系風險的措施，以識別可能存在的缺口，並確保這些措施的充分性；並鼓勵跨部門分享與宏觀監測相關的信息，鑑於增強香港金融管理局的宏觀監測能力。\n\n風險委員會的條款為：\n\n- 識別對機構潛在的風險和威脅，並制定策略以減低這些活動的影響；  \n- 檢討現有橫跨不同部門的風險管理系統，以識別可行的缺口和重大風險，並確保應對措施的充分性；  \n- 協調風險評估的標準和方法，並優先管理已識別的風險資源；以及  \n- 推動更強的機構層面風險管理文化，以促進嚴謹的授權和控制層面。\n\n已建立一個良好的營運風險管理架構，涵蓋組織在兩層面的風險：實體層面與部門層面。實體層面的風險主要指那些在中長期可能影響整個機構，或可能需要跨部門回應的風險。業務單位識別出的潛在及新興風險，以及其制定的控制措施和緩解策略的充足性，每季度都會進行審查並報告。此外，透過由上而下的方法來管理實體層面的風險，高層同事領導不同業務部門積極識別可能產生廣泛影響的風險，並提出緩解措施。風險委員會會討論這些評估結果，並決定合適的後續措施。\n"}
{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot

可持續性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）正發佈其首個可持續發展報告，作為其2021年度報告的其中一章，以建立其可持續發展戰略，並記錄其自身努力，以及與金融業的共同努力，以支持政府的氣候策略，並貢獻於一個更具氣候韌性和可持續的世界。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將可持續性考量融入其主要角色和職能中，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，還是維持金融和貨幣穩定。此外，香港金融管理局與本地及海外對應機構合作，加強氣候風險的管理與披露，以及綠色和可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，目標是成為一個負責任且可持續的機構。此承諾體現在各種範疇，包括推動可持續、金融普及及環保的市場，支持廣大社區，保護環境，以及培養關愛的工作空間。\n\n# 簡介\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最迫切挑戰之一。為應對氣候變化，各國在《巴黎協議》1下同意推行行動，以減少溫室氣體（GHG）排放，並最終在本世紀內爭取實現碳中和。要達成《巴黎協議》的氣候目標，全球每年需要約1至2萬億美元的投資2，這將使永續發展成為未來數十年資本流動的最大推動力之一。\n\n香港已制定方針，致力於在這項過渡中處於領先地位。特區政府公布，將爭取在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球發達經濟體的方針一致。香港亦是亞洲首個致力於在2025年前，具體呼應與氣候相關財務披露（TCFD）建議的披露要求，橫跨相關行業的地區。\n\n對金融部門而言，氣候變化既是風險來源，也是機會。雖然金融部門無法避免氣候變化帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金導向與接近更低溫室氣體排放及氣候韌性發展的途徑一致的活動。\n\n香港金融管理局致力加強香港的金融體系，以支持更綠色和可持續的未來，推動行動支持特區政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。為此，香港金融管理局在履行其主要職能及日常運作中，均納入可持續發展的考慮因素。\n\n首個，作為銀行監管機構，香港金管局的目標是加強銀行系統對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行支持向低碳經濟過渡的進度。為此，香港金管局制定了一套監管框架，明確銀行管理及披露氣候風險的監管要求。亦於2021年順利完成了一項氣候風險壓力測試試驗，以評估銀行業的韌性。另一方面，香港金管局持續在監測金融穩定風險時納入氣候變化的因素。\n\n第二，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在其市場發展角色中，正聚焦於增強香港作為區域內綠色及可持續金融中心的地位，包括大灣區（GBA）。作為內地的離岸金融中心，香港具有良好定位，可引導全球投資進入內地實現2030年碳排放達峰及2060年碳中和的計劃。香港金融管理局亦透過由其擔任聯席主席的綠色及可持續金融跨機構督導小組（CASG），提升業界能力、應對數據缺口，並探討建立本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港是綠色金融解決方案的領先者，已設立全球首個由政府管理的中期票據計劃，專注於政府綠色債券計劃下的綠色債券發行，並自2019年以來逐步增加發行的多樣性，無論是貨幣種類還是期限。為支持私人部門發行綠色和可持續債券及貸款，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色和可持續金融補貼計劃。由香港金管局管理，該計劃已激勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色和可持續融資，並鼓勵更多綠色顧問和外部審核機構在此設立或擴大業務。\n\n第三，作為匯率基金的經理，香港金管局確保環境、社會及治理（ESG）考慮是其投資過程和資產配置決策的其中一章。在本報告的後者部分，香港金管局作出其首份披露，關於匯率基金組合的氣候情景分析和碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正踏入提升自身綠色辦公室倡議，以確保其運作符合管理及緩解氣候風險的最佳實踐。作為開始，HKMA 已設立其範疇1及範疇2排放4的碳足跡，並作出相關披露。同時，HKMA 實施措施以提升業界整體運作效率並減少資源消耗。此外，HKMA 堅持高標準的企業社會責任（CSR），並與持份者合作，推動金融包容及金融理財知識。\n\n綠化金融體系需要中央銀行和監管機構之間的密切合作。香港金融管理局（HKMA）是國際社會在全球政策制定和可持續性標準對齊方面的積極成員。HKMA亦已發佈聲明支持中央銀行和監管機構綠色金融體系網絡（NGFS）的格拉斯哥宣言5，重申其落實NGFS建議的承諾，採取必要措施以促進更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動這些可持續發展倡議並評估氣候相關的機會與風險方面，可持續發展及綠色考慮已納入香港金融管理局（HKMA）的治理及風險管理框架之中，其中領導層積極參與制定總體目標及指導原則，並與財政儲備諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其子委員會進行諮詢。香港金融管理局的機構社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦會評估可持續發展及氣候相關問題對機構的潛在影響，並制定策略以減低這些影響。相關策略及倡議的執行情況會受到緊密監察，並定期報告給高層管理層。此外，亦聘請外部顧問就特定工作範疇向香港金融管理局提供意見。\n\n本章後續節將深入探討香港金融管理局在各個角色中進行綠色金融及可持續發展工作的治理架構、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告參考了NGFS於2021年12月發出的《中央銀行氣候相關披露指引》中建議的披露要素。此外，關於香港金融管理局辦公室運作的信息，廣泛參考了全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準6下的報告原則，以及由香港交易所有限公司頒布的ESG報告指引。\n\n#中央銀行與監管機構綠色金融網絡\n\nNGFS 提供一個平台，讓中央銀行與審慎監管機構交流經驗、分享最佳實踐，貢獻於金融部門環境與氣候風險管理的發展，並動員主流金融資源，支持朝向可持續經濟的轉型。其宗旨是界定並推動最佳實踐，在NGFS成員內部及境外實施，並進行或委託有關綠色金融的分析工作。\n\n# 氣候相關財務披露特別工作小組\n\n2015年12月，金融穩定委員會成立了TCFD，以制訂建議，促使公司向投資者、貸款機構和保險承保人進行更有效的與氣候相關的披露，能推動更認識的決策。TCFD的建議分為四個主題範疇，代表組織營運的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理以及指標和目標。\n\n# 銀行監管\n\n作為金融體系的核心其中一章，銀行應主動管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資金引導至綠色和可持續活動。作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局致力於建立銀行對氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行在支持轉向低碳經濟方面的努力。\n\n# 香港金融管理局三階段方法簡介\n\n自2019年5月以來，香港金融管理局一直在推動綠色和可持續銀行業，分三個階段：\n\n# 階段 I\n\n發展一個常見的框架以評估各銀行的「綠色基準」，並與國際機構合作，為香港的銀行提供技術支持。\n\n# 階段（ii）\n\n就綠色和可持續銀行業務的監管期望和要求向行業及其他持份者諮詢。\n\n# 階段（iii）\n\n聚焦於監管要求的落實，監測與評估銀行在綠色與永續金融方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 關於氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n2020年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）與業界合作，制定了評估各銀行「綠色基準」的常見框架。HKMA亦進行了首個銀行綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行準備新的監管要求，一份白皮書於2020年6月發出，闡釋了HKMA對氣候風險管理監管期望的初步想法。\n\n在2021年12月，根據產業諮詢，香港金融管理局（HKMA）發佈了監管要求，要求銀行將氣候因素納入治理、策略、風險管理和披露。特別是，根據TCFD的建議，強制要求銀行在2025年之前進行與氣候相關的披露，並制定了特定要求和具體時間表。這些要求將設定基準，協助銀行提升風險管理能力。\n\n下一步是由香港金融管理局（HKMA）監察銀行落實相關要求。在這方面，HKMA已加強其監督能力，透過在其銀行監督部門內成立一個新的專門團隊，以進行氣候風險監督。\n\n這種三階段方法是一個反覆的過程。在2020年進行的首輪綠色評估之後，香港金管局正在檢視框架以涵蓋新的氣候風險管理監管要求，並有可能涵蓋更廣泛的範圍，例如其他環境風險和支持淨零轉型的措施。香港金管局計劃於2022年下半年推出更新後的框架。\n\n# 稳健的實踐支持向碳中和過渡\n\n除了將氣候風險考量融入風險管理框架，一些銀行致力投入資源並採取措施，以支持《巴黎協議》的目標，並貢獻於爭取全球淨零排放。香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2021年12月發出通告，與業界分享這些銀行的良好實踐，這些實踐對業界其他銀行制定氣候策略具有參考價值。這些良好實踐分為四個範疇：減少銀行自身運營的溫室氣體排放、透過組合對齊減少融資排放、協助客戶過渡，以及推動集體努力協助經濟爭取淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融流動\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的制定一致性，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正與其他金融監管機構合作，探討建立本地綠色分類框架，以促進在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）所制定的常見標準分類法（CGT）與中國及歐盟採用的綠色定義之間的導航，並橫跨不同金融領域加以採用。此項工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性原則為指引，並採取其他綠色定義、過渡活動及本地因素等考量。此項倡議將減低綠色漂綠風險，優化產品可比性，並最終提升投資者保護。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化所帶來潛在衝擊的能力，香港金融管理局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試點計劃，該計劃包括20家主要零售銀行及七家國際銀行集團的分行參與。總結試點CRST計劃結果的報告於2021年12月發出。結果顯示，即使面對極端氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍然具備韌性，儘管這些衝擊有可能導致銀行財務方面出現重大不利影響。CRST計劃有助提升銀行測量及評估氣候風險的能力。鑑於CRST結果，參與銀行已擬定計劃，以加強其氣候策略及風險治理架構。香港金融管理局將繼續與業界保持聯繫，以加強銀行的能力並提升CRST架構，同時考慮試點計劃所帶來的經驗教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

交易所基金\n\n審計主任報告：交易所基金財務報表\n\n# 审計委員會 香港特殊行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審計了證券基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）列於第217至319頁的財務報表，其中包括證券基金及集團截至2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及其收入及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表及截至該年份結束的現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n根據我的意見，財務報表提供截至2021年12月31日止基金及集團財務狀況之真實及公允鑑於，以及該財政年度結束時止之財務表現及現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈之香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，且已根據行政長官根據儲備基金條例（第66章）第7條作出之指令妥為編製。\n\n#意見基礎\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7部分及審計委員會審計標準所作出的指示進行審計。我在這些標準下的職責進一步載於我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的職責」部分。根據這些標準，我與該集團保持獨立，並已根據這些標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且合適，作為我提出意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指依我專業判斷，在截至2021年12月31日之年度財務報表審計中最具重要性之事項。這些事項係在審計財務報表整體之背景下進行處理，並在形成我對此之意見時予以考量，我並不就這些事項另行提供意見。\n\n# 按公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，集團的財務資產總額達港元4,502,475百萬，財務負債總額達港元1,150,861百萬，估值為公允價值。\n\n對於這些財務資產的89%以及所有這些財務負債，其公允價值為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層輸入值），或係根據以可觀察市場數據為基礎的輸入值，用以評估技術所估計的（第二層輸入值）。\n\n對於這些財務資產中餘下的11%，其公允價值是透過估值技術進行估計，而這些技術所使用的輸入數據並非以可觀察的市場數據為基礎（第三級輸入數據）。此類財務資產總值為港元517,316億元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於涉及的大量金額及估計，以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債為關鍵審計事項。\n\n審計程序針對金融資產和金融負債的公允價值評估包括：\n\n- 取得對評估不同類別金融資產和金融負債程序的了解，包括相關控制措施；  \n- 評估和測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制措施；  \n- 取得對金融資產和金融負債估值、存在性、權利和義務以及完整性的外部確認；  \n- 若運用報價市場價格，則驗證價格至獨立資料來源；  \n- 若運用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的輸入值進行估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並驗證輸入值至獨立資料來源；  \n- 若運用非基於可觀察市場數據的輸入值進行估值技術，則評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入值的合理性。\n\n# 投資性不動產按公允價值計量\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.11、18 和 19。\n\n集團的投資物業以公允價值列帳，截至2021年12月31日總額達港幣27,089百萬。集團亦持有1間聯營公司及21間合營公司的權益，總額達港幣45,172百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。此類投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有，還是由聯營公司或合營公司持有，主要以獨立專業評估師的估值為基礎制定。此類估值涉及重大判斷和估計，包括估值方法及所使用的假設。\n\n對投資性不動產公允價值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n- 取得並檢視集團直接或由關聯公司或合營公司舉辦的投資物業估值報告，並驗證公平價值是否以估值報告中列帳的估值為基礎；\n- 評估估價師的獨立性及資格；以及\n- 評估估值方法的適當性及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港貨幣管理局2021年年度報告中所載的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師就該報告所作出的報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並不針對此表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在這樣做時考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或否則是否顯著誤述。如果根據我所進行的工作，我得出結論認為這項其他資訊存在重大誤述，則我必須報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何需要報告的內容。\n\n# 貨幣當局及外匯基金諮詢委員會審計委員會就財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則，以及行政長官根據《儲備基金條例》第7條作出的指示，準備提供真實及公平鑑於的財務報表，並制定貨幣管理局認為必要以確保財務報表免於重大錯誤陳述的內部控制機制，無論該錯誤是否由於欺詐或錯誤所致。\n\n在準備財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營的能力，並在適用時披露與持續經營相關的事項，並用以持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n匯換基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的職責\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表整體是否免費於重大錯誤陳述，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並發行包含我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是一種高水準的保證，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，能一如既往地偵測到存在的重要錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能來自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或總體而言，能合理預期會影響用戶基於這些財務報表所採取的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為其中一章審計，根據審計委員會的審計標準，我試驗專業判斷並在整個審計過程中維持專業懷疑態度。我也：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論該風險是否由於舞弊或錯誤所致，設計並執行針對該等風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且合適的審計證據，作為我提出意見的基礎。未能察覺因舞弊導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意省略、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制的行為；\n- 為設計適合情況的審計程序，取得與審計相關的內部控制理解，但並非用於對集團內部控制有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎進行會計的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，則必須在我審計師報告中指出財務報表中相關的披露，若該等披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至我審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表整體的呈現方式、結構及內容，包括披露內容，並判斷財務報表是否以實現公平呈現的方式反映其底層交易及事件；以及\n- 取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且合適審計證據，以便對財務報表發表意見。我對集團審計的指揮、監督及執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見完全負責。\n\n我就_exchange基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會_等事項進行溝通，包括審計的預計範圍和時間安排以及重大審計結果，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何重大內部控制缺失。\n\n我亦向財政儲備諮詢委員會審計小組委員會提供聲明，表明我已遵守就獨立性而言的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會對我的獨立性產生影響的關係及其他事項，並在適用時說明相關保障措施。\n\n根據與財政儲備諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事宜，我釐定出在當前會計期間財務報表審計中最具重要性的事項，因此為關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止就該事宜進行公開披露，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事宜的不利後果合理預期會超過此類溝通對公眾利益的裨益，因而決定不將該事項納入報告中。\n\n約翰·朱 稽核主任\n"}
