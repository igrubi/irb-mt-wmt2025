{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

2023.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introduce

面對逆境的韌性\n\n在「高利率較長時間」的環境下，全球經濟增長放緩，以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇——不僅源於俄烏戰爭和中美緊張關係，亦包括中東衝突爆發——成為2023年金融市場的關鍵主題。美國與歐洲在三月的銀行危機，自2008年全球金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力，進一步壓抑市場情緒。主要經濟體面臨收緊貨幣政策的嚴峻現實，以及對通脹路徑與利率展望的更大不確定性。此外，中國大陸經濟復甦的步調較普遍市場預期為慢，亦增添不確定性。\n\n在金融市場波動與難以預測性成為「新常態」的背景下，香港再次證明了其知名適應能力，展現出非凡的韌性。自去年城市全面後疫情時代重啟以來，已進行多項工作，以吸引人民重返我們多變的城市，並與香港重新連繫。香港金融管理局（HKMA）透過舉辦一系列大型國際活動，例如全球金融領袖投資峰會及與國際清算銀行（BIS）的會議，為香港的活躍城市形象提供了展示平台，並幫助向全球傳達信息，表明香港作為主要國際金融中心（IFC），持續開放營商，並仍是行動與創新的中心。目前有明顯跡象顯示逐步復甦，這是由入境旅遊業的鼓舞性復甦及私人消費的改善所推動，亦得到具韌性的勞動市場及政府推出的不同支持措施的支持。就全年而言，2023年香港的國內生產總值增長從2022年的負面領域彈回3.2%。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2023年進入其第四個十年。過去30年來，經濟及金融市場的動態發生了巨大變化，科技推動的進步超越任何人最天馬行空的想像。過去三個十年所積累的無價經驗與智慧，使我們得以以信心面對未來。儘管面對宏觀經濟逆風及不確定的外部環境，香港金融管理局將繼續維護其保護香港貨幣和銀行體系穩定的使命，並積極推動發展機會以鞏固這種穩定性，以及鞏固這座城市作為領先國際金融中心的地位。\n\n香港特別行政區政府前後任財政司司長及香港金融管理局（HKMA）局長於慶祝香港金融管理局（HKMA）三十週年聚會上合照：（由左至右）楊鐵樑先生、湯顯明先生、曾蔭權先生、陳家強先生、葉劉淑儀先生、梁錦松先生、張建宗先生及陳德銘先生\n\n#

逆境求生\n\n去年是掛鈎匯率制度（LERS）40周年，該制度是支持香港雄厚且穩健的貨幣及金融體系的堅實支柱。四十年來透明且有效的運作培育了市場對LERS的信心及其可信性。全年來，港元匯率維持在可兌換範圍內，港元市場運作暢順，反映市場對LERS的強大信心，此信心亦被國際貨幣基金組織及全球市場參與者所分享和表示。\n\n信心背後，是香港金融管理局（HKMA）在公眾及市場活動中所作出的積極努力，以及有效的監測措施。我們在本年度不遺餘力與主要持份者溝通，以促進對LERS運作的清晰了解，這在波動時期尤為重要，無論波動源於經濟壓力或政治不確定因素。我們亦加強了對貨幣體系的監測，藉使用交易倉庫的數據集、拓展銀行的細粒度數據，以及運用先進的數據分析和人工智能，提升我們的能力，讓我們能進行更及時和全面的金融穩定及宏觀審慎監測分析。\n\n# 銀行體系 — 穩定性的重要資料來源\n\n儘管面對眾多挑戰，包括高息環境、持續的地緣政治緊張局勢以及充滿挑戰的信貸環境，香港的銀行體系全年維持穩健，得益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝支持。\n\n截至2023年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本比率維持在21.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率截至2023年第四季微升至178.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的100%。雖然分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%微升至2023年底的1.56%，但仍維持在長期歷史平均值2.0%以下。此增加主要由對內地私營企業房地產開發商的風險敞口推動；但由於銀行多年來審慎的信貸風險管理，此類風險敞口一般而言更廣泛層面得到有效控制，銀行業整體資產品質仍保持健康。\n\n2023年令大多數市場參與者感到意外的，毫無疑問是美國銀行危機蔓延至歐洲，造成自2008年全球金融危機以來前所未有的系統性銀行壓力。香港金管局在情況發展過程中保持高度警覺，並接任多項預防措施，以限制對本地銀行和金融體系信心的潛在負面溢出影響。這一點，以及香港銀行維持的雄厚資本和流動性緩衝，意味著我們的銀行業基本上未受動盪影響，即使全球金融市場動盪，仍維持韌性。在這起事件之後，香港金管局進行了一次全面的內部檢討，旨在汲取經驗，以加強香港金管局的監管效能和靈活性，以便在未來發生銀行危機時能夠妥善處理。\n\n審慎的信貸風險管理固然重要，但我們一直重申監管預期，要求銀行時刻銘記支持實體經濟的需要。隨著新型冠狀病毒肺炎疫情經濟影響減退，銀行業預先核准的本金付款寬限期於2023年7月開始有秩序地退出，香港金融管理局與銀行緊密合作，確保貸款償還逐步和暢順過渡，並為仍面臨壓力的借款人提供靈活性。今年較早時候，鑒於部分中小企業即使在疫情結束後仍面臨經營挑戰，香港金融管理局推出了九項新措施，進一步協助這些企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n在檢討與本地樓市相關的風險後，香港金融管理局於2023年7月宣布，自2009年推出以來首次放寬住宅物業的逆週期宏觀審慎措施。此項放寬措施使大部分住宅按揭貸款以及樓宇發展及投資融資的貸款與價值比率上限上升。其後在2024年初，則暫停了利率壓力測試要求。\n\n香港金融管理局對金融機構的監管一直與時並進。近年來全球詐騙情況急劇增加，我們已大幅加強努力，通過推出一套全面措施來對抗新型詐騙手法，以保障銀行客戶。這些措施包括加強銀行與執法機構之間的信息共享；加強對可疑交易的監控（包括實時詐騙監控的執行以及支付卡認證的收緊）；授權客戶對其支付卡擁有更多控制權；以及透過推出《反詐騙消費者保障憲章》及交易前警示機制，提高客戶對詐騙的警覺性，當識別到較高風險的快速支付系統（FPS）交易時，會向用戶發出警告。\n\n鑑於創新及數碼銀行產品及服務的快速增長，香港金融管理局（HKMA）已與銀行業界合作，加強消費者及投資者保護，提升銀行的運作及網絡韌性，以及對系統性網絡事件的集體防禦能力。同時，所有主要銀行已大幅加強其應對及從具破壞性勒索軟體攻擊中復甦的能力。香港金融管理局與業界亦推動了不同消費者數據基礎設施項目，例如「信貸數據智」試驗計劃，以提升消費者信貸參考服務，並推動跨邊界信貸參考倡議，以便利企業進行跨境融資活動。\n\n當風險得到妥善管理時，金融科技與數字化可帶來巨大的機會。藉較早的成功推動Regtech的採用，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）和保險業監理機構的支持下，於2023年8月載有新的《金融科技推廣路線圖》，以推動金融機構在五個重點範疇——Wealthtech、Insurtech、Greentech、人工智慧及分布式賬本技術——進一步發展金融科技。我們預期本地監管機構將繼續與其行業範疇緊密合作，在未來幾年內，以便香港金融業整體能保持同步，把握多變金融科技發展的優勢。\n\n# 香港作為國際金融中心 — 行動與創新的中心\n\n2023年，我們充分擺脫了疫情。香港不僅恢復了經濟活動，而且在全球投資者回流及我們加強的全球網絡支持下，作為世界領先的國際金融中心之一的地位進一步得到強化。在本地，我們把握香港金融管理專員處成立三十週年的機遇，主辦一系列規模龐大的國際活動，吸引全球金融和銀行界高層參與，以展示香港的活力，並向外界傳達明確信息，即香港作為國際金融中心，對尋求增長與創新的全球投資者和金融機構而言，依然具有相關性與不可或缺性。尤其值得注意的是，11月重啟的全球金融領袖投資峰會，吸引了來自全球約160家金融機構的350多名國際及地區領袖來到香港。在香港舉辦的其他高級別活動包括巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）會議，以及兩場香港金融管理專員處與國際清算銀行（BIS）合辦的會議，這兩場會議是當年規模最大的中央銀行總裁與銀行監理機構的聚會。這些活動證明了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n對外而言，2023年亦是香港積極達到加強與包括美國和歐洲在內的傳統市場，以及中東等新目的地之間聯繫的一年。我們與這些市場的同級監管機構及全球金融機構的高層管理人員達到，向他們介紹香港及內地的機會，同時力求為香港尋找新的合作機會。\n\n為配合這些聯繫努力，我們積極佔據國際及區域組織的若干領導職位。在本年度，我接受了擔任BIS主要新興市場經濟體總理會議主席，以及擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）亞洲區域諮詢小組聯席主席的邀請。我的同事亦正擔任巴塞爾委員會、金融行動特別工作小組，以及東亞及太平洋中央銀行總裁會議等其他重要小組的主席或聯席主席職務。香港金融管理局在許多區域及國際組織中的領導地位，是對香港在推動全球貨幣及金融穩定的過程中所具備的專門知識和貢獻，以及香港作為國際金融中心重要性的認可。\n\n為建立於上述成就之上，我們必須確立自身作為一個前瞻性的國際金融中心地位，保持前瞻立場以確保我們持續的競爭力。我們已識別出未來數年將塑造我們未來的三大長期趨勢，即內地持續開放、綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及金融科技的應用。我們將持續支持金融市場的發展，以把握這些長期趨勢帶來的機會，同時定位我們的金融平台，提供領先的服務以吸引更多業務來香港。有關我們在綠色及可持續金融方面的工作詳情，讀者可參閱我們的《2023年可持續發展報告》。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment. Significant progress is also made in relation to developing a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers, with a public consultation paper published for gathering views on the legislative proposal.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite a volatile and challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund manages to achieve a decent investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts on asset diversification and responsible investing. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio records an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains active communication with the community and the market through different channels to promote public understanding about its policies and operations.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to build an agile and professional workforce, maintain rigorous financial discipline and upgrade its digital capabilities to adapt to changes and ensure effective implementation of its policies and

2023年摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年仍錄得正面增長，這是由入境旅遊及內需復甦所推動。勞動市場隨着經濟復甦繼續改善，通脹則繼續保持溫和。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和的步伐進一步復甦，但前景因多個外部不明朗因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年繼續健康，得益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝。資產質素繼續保持在健康的水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將維持較高水平較長時間的情況下，港元於2023年大部分時間在貨幣發行局的弱方兌換範圍內交易，弱方兌換承擔機制在2月中至5月初期間被觸發8次。港元匯兌及貨幣市場保持穩健，並繼續以暢順及有秩序的方式進行交易。\n\n2023年標誌著掛鈎匯率制度的40周年。作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，掛鈎匯率制度幫助香港抵禦了過去四十年來的一系列震盪和危機，展現了該制度的韌性和穩健性。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速應對三月美國及歐洲的銀行業動盪，從管理餘波至完成內部檢討，汲取經驗以供本地銀行業參考，同時維持其重點在於銀行的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加，以及對由第三方提供的技術服務使用不斷上升，香港金融管理局亦與銀行緊密合作，以提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局提升支付卡的消費者保障措施，並通過進一步修訂《銀行業守則》以及《反詐騙消費者保障公約》。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，建立平衡的虛擬資產相關活動監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，引入提升措施至跨境理財通試驗計劃，並開始監管信託業務。亦推出名為「Credit Data Smart」的消費者信貸資料服務試驗計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在反洗錢及櫃台融資方面的努力展現了其承諾，以風險為本的方法針對最高威脅。為應對增加的數字詐騙，香港金融管理局已透過推出即時詐騙監測、提升銀行與執法機構之間的資訊共享、加強公眾教育，以及推出使用快速支付系統時的新交易前警報機制，加強生態系統合作。與此同時，監管科技能力亦透過宏觀分析試驗計劃得到提升。\n\n香港金融管理局在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露等標準，並在加強銀行業能力建設方面作出顯著努力。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推進其工作，以確保一個可信的解決機制，包括制定關於接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施的新解決標準，以及完成對執行吸收損失能力政策標準的審查。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會及HKMA-BIS高層次會議的順利舉行，展現了全球金融界對香港的承諾與信心。\n\n香港金管局與其內地及香港有關當局緊密合作，深化並擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。這包括提升跨境理財通計劃，為債券通南向交易指定額外做市商，順利推出Swap Connect北向交易，以及推出港元人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台做市計劃，所有這些措施均有效鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n在加強香港金融平台競爭力方面，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續金融，以及企業現金管理中心等範疇，已取得顯著進展。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在「金融科技2025」策略的各個不同範疇中，繼續取得重大進展。mBridge項目已進入最小可行性產品的開發階段，e-HKD測試計劃第一階段已完成，商業數據交換平台的使用率增加，並與政府數據來源順利對接。此外，已宣布新的金融科技推廣路線圖，以進一步發展財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智慧及銀行業的分布式賬本技術。與此同時，快速支付系統迎來五周年，並持續拓展應用及提升功能，包括與泰國PromptPay對接以實現跨境QR支付等新功能。在制定穩定幣發行機構的監管框架方面亦取得重大進展，並已發布公開諮詢文件以收集對立法建議的意見。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n儘管投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰，香港儲備基金仍成功取得2,260億港元的良好投資收益，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續其資產多元化及負責任投資的努力。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來，錄得年化內部回報率11.8%。\n\n#企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過不同渠道與社區及市場維持積極聯繫，以推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。\n\n在內部，香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力於建立一支靈活應變且專業的員工隊伍，維持嚴謹的財政紀律，並提升其數字化能力以適應變化，確保其政策和倡議的有效執行。"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards.

工作重點：2024年及前瞻\n\n進入2024年，香港經濟預計將以溫和的步伐繼續復甦，依靠持續的內地遊客復甦、公共基礎設施項目以及穩健的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險和不明朗因素，特別是與未來美國政策利率路徑、全球增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢相關的因素。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性和多年來累積的充足緩衝，仍處於有利位置，能夠抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n香港金融管理局視保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定為重大任務。展望未來，我們將在面對不確定的宏觀經濟環境時保持警覺，力求及時識別新興風險，並以靈活應變的方式應對。同時，我們將尋求機會，創造政策空間，協助進一步提升香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位。在這個充滿挑戰的投資環境中管理儲備基金時，我們將繼續謹慎投資，保持靈活，視情況採取適當的防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性與健全性\n\n近年全球經濟的不明朗因素似乎將會在2024年繼續。香港金管局將緊貼最新發展，並對潛在風險保持警惕，目標是維護金融系統的韌性及穩定性，這些對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n#保持警覺以防潛在風險\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能經驗波動，這是由於美國貨幣政策展望的不確定性、地緣政治風險的演變以及全球經濟復甦的不均衡所導致。2024年亦是關鍵的選舉年，因為多間主要選舉定於世界各地舉行。這些選舉的結果可能進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，考慮到香港金融體系多年來累積的韌性及緩衝措施，香港金融體系給予其韌性以及多年來累積的緩衝措施，香港金融管理局亦具備能力、資源及承諾，以維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續努力，緊密監察在香港及國際環境中出現的任何風險和弱點，並在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦會進行研究，針對影響香港經濟的問題，評估並應對與這些問題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定性\n\n2023年，全球各地出現新的地緣政治緊張局勢，而其他爭端亦維持未解決狀態，導致政治不確定性與不穩定性，情況預期將持續至2024年。高利率作為經濟壓力的表現形式，是全球經濟環境的特徵，而利率在進入2024年時仍維持高水準。在銀行業方面，持續推動數位化及執行新技術，包括人工智慧，雖然帶來許多優勢，但也同時帶來新的營運及網路安全風險，以及監管上的挑戰。在如此動盪的政治、經濟及科技環境中，香港金融管理局致力透過持續的監管努力，確保銀行具備抵禦震盪的能力。同時，我們亦會繼續提升及優化銀行監管及監督架構與政策，並考慮科技發展、客戶預期的改變，以及國際標準與最高實務。\n\n#風險為本的監督重點\n\n# 信用風險、流動性風險及市場風險\n\n鑑於日益充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境，香港金融管理局（HKMA）的特別重點將放在監測授權機構（AIs）的資產質量，並評估其信貸風險管理與控制措施的有效性，尤其在貸款分類與撥備實務及問題貸款管理方面。我們亦將與銀行及商業行業維持緊密對話，以確保AIs在經濟週期內，在進行審慎信貸風險管理與履行其金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡。特別是，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟進銀行針對2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行取得融資。\n\n全球經濟展望的不明朗因素以及升高的地緣政治緊張局勢可能增加資產價格和跨境資金流動的波動性。香港金融管理局（HKMA）將取得謹慎為優先事項，並會繼續更有效地監管機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n#跟進行動：從2023年銀行危機中汲取的經驗\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將推行在回應2023年美國和歐洲銀行業動盪時所進行的內部審查中確定的跟進行動。這些行動將進一步加強監管有效性，並提升其在銀行危機出現時的處理能力。這些包括在香港金融管理局（HKMA）的監管審查過程背景下，加強對持牌機構（AIs）銀行賬簿中利率風險的風險捕捉；改善持牌機構（AIs）在銀行服務持續數字化的背景下處理流動性壓力的準備；簡化香港金融管理局（HKMA）的危機管理流程，以及進一步加強跨機構和跨境的監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續監察銀行機構在達成全面合規方面的進展，以符合HKMA監管政策手冊（SPM）有關「營運韌性」的OR-2模塊，並評估和對比銀行對可合理預期中斷的容忍限額，以加強銀行體系的整體韌性。在網絡風險方面，我們將監察銀行機構根據網絡韌性評估框架2.0進行的一輪自我評估，並監察銀行機構落實安全的第三層數據備份，以提升其在面對具破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑑於數字化在銀行業務中加速的步伐，香港金管局將保持緊密關注來自使用先進科技如生成式人工智慧和分布式分類帳科技所產生的新興風險。我們亦將與銀行及其他相關利益相關方合作，在運作靈活應變及預防性的機制以櫃台持續增長的數字詐騙趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義資金\n\n2024年，為維護銀行體系的健全並建立客戶信心，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將針對高風險範疇，優先進行風險為本的監管更新，包括發行指引以支持有效、風險為本地落實對政治敏感人物要求的修改，並支持穩定幣發行機構監管制度的執行。我們亦將發行指引協助人工智能優化其交易監控系統，推動人工智慧的負責任使用，並透過主題工作重點放在應對高階洗錢的控制措施上。為加強生態系統對數字詐騙的應對並減低受害者的損失，我們將就擴大銀行間資訊共享範圍的建議進行公眾和業界的諮詢，從企業帳戶擴展至個人帳戶，並基於收到的反饋推動必要的立法修訂。我們將透過跨多間銀行匯集與反洗錢相關的數據，全面建置Macro Analytics 3.0，並與現有的生態系統詐騙分析接介。這將帶來更迅速的跨銀行回應，並進一步提升我們數據驅動的反洗錢及反恐融資監管，讓我們能對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險採取更迅速、更果斷的行動。\n\n#財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n2024年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將加強對授權機構（AIs）在財富管理及銷售證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務方面的現場檢查及非現場監管。具體而言，我們將重點放在跨境財富管理通（Cross-boundary WMC）業務、數字化分銷及顧問平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品及保費融資活動，鑑於最新市場發展以及不斷演進的國際標準。\n\n香港金融管理局將與其他監管機構及銀行業界進行緊密溝通，並在適當的時候就投資、保險及強積金產品銷售方面的監管標準提供指引。尤其為支持VA行業的可持續及負責任發展，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保現行針對VA行業的監管制度穩健、全面及平衡。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將便利並監察業界執行跨境WMC的提升措施，並繼續與業界及相關監管機構接觸，以便進一步提升該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構及業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並視情況合適地整合及澄清指引，以便利業界合規。除信託業務外，我們亦將於2024年10月2日開始監督根據《證券及期貨條例》第13類受規管活動的新監管範疇，該範疇適用於為經證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）認可的集體投資計劃提供保管服務的資產管理機構（AIs）。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）旨在根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）、《金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI）以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的不同指引，推動其監管範圍內的金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全及效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO1的PFMI執行監測及評估工作，以及其他國際工作小組，商討與金融市場基礎設施相關的新穎及創新倡議的執行情況。我們亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並適當地檢討及加強監管要求，以反映最新的國際實務以及市場及科技發展。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將繼續加強和完善其銀行監管及監管框架和政策，鑑於國際標準和最高實踐。\n\n# 在香港執行巴塞爾標準\n\n擬議修訂《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）及《銀行（披露）規則》（BDR），以實施巴塞爾III最終改革方案（Final Package），預計將於立法會通過修訂後的規則後，於2025年1月1日生效。2024年，金管局將繼續準備支持規則應用所需的指引、銀行報表及標準披露格式和表格。尤其，我們計劃：  \n- 於2024年第2屆季度就SPM模組CA-B-3「逆週期資本緩衝（CCyB）－私人部門信貸風險的地理分配」及報表MA(BS)25「逆週期資本緩衝季度報告」的修訂進行業界諮詢，反映最終改革方案的實施及國際銀行統計報表修訂所帶來的後續變更；以及  \n- 完成有關落實新市場及信貸估值調整風險標準僅需報告要求的套件，該要求將於2024年7月1日開始實施。\n\n那些地區的 Banking (Exposure Limits) 規則 (BELR) 和 Banking (Liquidity) 規則 (BLR) 的擬議修訂，主要係因應修訂後的 BCR 下最終套件的執行而產生，亦預計於 2025 年 1 月 1 日生效。香港金融管理局（HKMA）計劃於 2024 年完成相關監管回報的擬議後續修訂。\n\n與此同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會分別於2022年12月及2023年12月發佈了關於銀行加密資產風險敞口審慎管理的新標準，以及針對該標準的後續針對性修訂。本地將於2025年執行該標準。香港金融管理局將審視對不同類別規則（包括BCR、BDR、BELR及BLR）進行潛在立法修訂的需要，並於2025年上半年進行有關必要規則修訂的法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監管政策與風險管理指引\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）計劃根據2023年3月美國及歐洲銀行危機中獲得的經驗，以及監管要求和國際標準的最新發展，介紹若干SPM模塊。這些模塊包括：\n"}
{"en":"# About the HKMA\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is Hong Kong’s central banking institution. The HKMA has four main functions:\n- maintaining currency stability within the framework of the Linked Exchange Rate System;\n- promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system;\n- helping to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, including the maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and\n- managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# HKMA’s legal mandate\n\nThe HKMA was established on 1 April 1993 after the Legislative Council passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992 empowering the Financial Secretary to appoint a Monetary Authority.\n\nThe powers, functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant Ordinances. The division of functions and responsibilities in monetary and financial affairs between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority is set out in an exchange of letters dated 25 June 2003. The exchange of letters discloses delegations made by the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Ordinance establishes the Exchange Fund under the control of the Financial Secretary. According to the Ordinance, the Fund shall be used primarily for affecting the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. It may also be used (whilst having regard to its primary purpose) for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong, with a view to maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in performing his functions under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and to perform such other functions as are assigned by other Ordinances or by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe Banking Ordinance provides the Monetary Authority with the responsibility and powers for regulating and supervising banking business and the business of taking deposits. Under the Ordinance, the Monetary Authority is responsible for the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for banking sector entities. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of a non-viable banking sector entity (the failure of which could pose systemic risk). The purpose is to maintain financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance provide certain powers to the Monetary Authority regarding the securities and mandatory provident fund businesses of banks.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has been delegated with powers of inspection and investigation by the Insurance Authority under the Insurance Ordinance in relation to the insurance related businesses of banks.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks’ compliance with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to assist in the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to trigger payment of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of a failed licensed bank.\n\nThe Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance provides a statutory regime for the Monetary Authority to designate and oversee certain significant clearing and settlement systems and retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. It also empowers the Monetary Authority to administer a licensing regime for electronic and physical “facilities”, which are used to store monetary value and which meet the criteria specified in the Ordinance.","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introd

的法定職能\n\n貨幣管理局於1993年4月1日成立，這是在1992年立法會通過修訂《外匯基金條例》，授權財政司長委任貨幣管理局之後。\n\n香港金融管理局的權力、職能和責任是根據《外匯基金條例》、《銀行條例》、《金融機構（解決辦法）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值憑證設施條例》及其他相關條例所設立。財政司與香港金融管理局在貨幣及金融事務上的職能和責任分工，載於2003年6月25日的函件交換中。該函件交換披露了財政司向香港金融管理局作出的權力轉授。這些函件為公眾文件，可於香港金融管理局網站查閱。\n\n《貨幣基金條例》設立了由財政司司長掌管的貨幣基金。根據條例，基金須主要用於影響港元匯率。亦可能（同時顧及主要目的）用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n貨幣管理局是根據《外匯基金條例》委任，協助財政司長執行其根據《外匯基金條例》的職能，並執行其他由其他條例或財政司長所指派的職能。貨幣管理局的職位稱為香港金融管理局（HKMA），而貨幣管理局則為香港金融管理局的行政總裁。\n\n《銀行條例》規定，貨幣當局負有規管及監管銀行業務和吸收存款業務的責任及權力。根據《條例》，貨幣當局負責認可香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司的授權。\n\n《金融機構（解決）條例》規定，貨幣當局是銀行業實體的解決當局。貨幣當局獲賦予一類權力，以生效有秩序地解決不可持續經營的銀行業實體（其倒閉可能構成系統性風險）。其目的是維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公眾資金。\n\n證券及期貨條例與強制性公積金計劃條例為貨幣當局提供若干權力，有關銀行的證券及強制性公積金業務。\n\n貨幣當局已根據《保險條例》由保險當局轉授查察及調查權力，涉及銀行的保險相關業務方面。\n\n反洗錢及反恐融資條例授權貨幣當局監管銀行遵守條例下關於客戶盡職調查及紀錄保存要求的合規情況。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予貨幣當局協助運作存款保障計劃，並啟動從存款保障計劃基金向已失敗的持牌銀行存款人支付補償的責任。\n\n《支付系統及儲值設施條例》規定，貨幣管理局可指定及監察若干重大清算及結算系統以及在香港運作的零售支付系統。條例亦授權貨幣管理局管理電子及實體「設施」的牌照制度，這些設施用於儲存貨幣價值，並符合條例內訂明的準則。"}
{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA. This serves as the first line of defence for risk management.\n\n# Organisational risk management\n\nRisk management is also undertaken at the corporate level, with the Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, being one of the cornerstones of the organisational risk management framework.\n\nPotential and emerging risks identified by the functional units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reported to and discussed at the Risk Committee, which decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division of the HKMA independently assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes of different functional units, and advises on areas for improvement.\n\n# External audit\n\nIn accordance with section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Audit Commission of the HKSAR Government audits the financial statements of the Exchange Fund. The Commission does not charge for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are included in the HKMA Annual Report.\n","terms":{"signs":["跡象"],"added":["新增"],"later":["其後"],"took":["接任"],"auspices":["支持"],"closely":["緊密"],"stellar":["可觀"],"advanced":["先進"],"past":["過去"],"signed":["簽訂"],"work":["工作"],"abreast":["緊貼"],"leading":["領先"],"introducing":["推出"],"back":["回復"],"’":[""],"use":["使用"],"facilitate":["便利"],"21.1":["21.1%"],"successfully":["成功"],"focus":["重點"],"whole":["全年"],"shortly":["不久"],"Apart":["除了"],"particular":["尤其"],"conducted":["進行"],"thereby":["從而"],"expressed":["表示"],"slowing":["放緩"],"worked":["合作"],"appropriate":["適當"],"gradual":["逐步"],"People":["人民"],"message":["信息"],"spotted":["識別"],"Progress":["進展"],"dotted":["比比皆是"],"Taking":["鑑於"],"relaxation":["放寬"],"range":["種類"],"—":["—"],"number":["數字"],"city":["城市"],"general":["普遍"],"unpredictability":["難以預測"],"third":["第三"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"effort":["工作"],"Moreover":["此外"],"since":["自"],"bracing":["迎來"],"introduction":["推出"],"revival":["復甦"],"confidence":["信心"],"matter":["問題"],"fronts":["範疇"],"wisdom":["智慧"],"update":["介紹"],"similarly":["同樣"],"launched":["推出"],"celebrate":["慶祝"],"colleagues":["同事"],"Despite":["儘管"],"stood":["維持"],"opportunity":["機遇"],"deepen":["深化"],"Details":["詳情"],"significant":["重大"],"Shenzhen":["深圳市"],"strong":["雄厚"],"high-powered":["高級別"],"obtain":["取得"],"departments":["部門"],"opening-up":["開放"],"continue":["繼續"],"timely":["及時"],"attracted":["吸引"],"expansion":["擴展"],"million":["百萬"],"shown":["體現"],"launch":["推出"],"expectations":["預期"],"Mr":["先生"],"success":["成功"],"towards":["朝"],"pace":["步伐"],"awareness":["意識"],"handle":["處理"],"able":["能夠"],"despite":["儘管"],"subsequent":["隨後"],"efforts":["努力"],"2024":["2024年"],"reap":["把握"],"much":["多項"],"high":["高"],"cement":["鞏固"],"broad-based":["全面"],"increased":["上升"],"topping":["增值"],"counter":["櫃台"],"aim":["目標"],"protect":["保障"],"2021":["2021年"],"credibility":["可信性"],"last":["去年"],"enriched":["豐富"],"issuing":["發行"],"smoothly":["暢順"],"within":["內"],"themes":["主題"],"IFCs":["國際金融中心"],"maintained":["維持"],"providing":["提供"],"anniversary":["周年"],"arise":["出現"],"rapidly":["迅速"],"forums":["組織"],"players":["參與者"],"exceeding":["超過"],"establish":["建立"],"existing":["現有"],"nine":["9"],"40th":["40周年"],"gatherings":["聚會"],"30":["30"],"strengthen":["加強"],"receding":["減退"],"proliferation":["快速增長"],"regards":["方面"],"year":["年"],"leaders":["領導人"],"covered":["涵蓋"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"Externally":["對外"],"foster":["促進"],"geopolitical":["地緣政治"],"team":["團隊"],"along":["連同"],"decades":["十年"],"always":["一直"],"potential":["潛在"],"Secretaries":["司司長"],"shocks":["震盪"],"opening":["重新連繫"],"implement":["推行"],"need":["需要"],"facilitative":["便利"],"may":["可能"],"years":["年"],"law":["法例"],"turbulence":["波動"],"commenced":["開始"],"overshadow":["蒙上陰影"],"introduced":["推出"],"forward-looking":["長遠"],"Leveraging":["藉"],"became":["成為"],"billion":["億"],"series":["一連串"],"progressing":["推進"],"1.56":["1.56%"],"pillar":["支柱"],"currencies":["貨幣"],"experience":["經驗"],"offering":["提供"],"pursuit":["推動"],"say":["說"],"30th":["三十週年"],"digitising":["數碼化"],"enabling":["讓"],"residents":["居民"],"increase":["增加"],"bounce":["反彈"],"milestones":["里程碑"],"August":["8月"],"pave":["鋪路"],"step":["步驟"],"name":["名稱"],"end":["年底"],"consecutive":["連續"],"actions":["行動"],"ability":["能力"],"Zone":["範圍"],"negotiating":["磋商"],"tightened":["收緊"],"reconnect":["重新連繫"],"relevant":["相關"],"contribution":["貢獻"],"obtaining":["取得"],"implementation":["執行"],"cities":["城市"],"pursue":["推動"],"position":["地位"],"sure":["相信"],"expanded":["拓展"],"improve":["改善"],"supporting":["支持"],"proactively":["積極"],"cases":["情況"],"linkage":["對接"],"episode":["事件"],"one":["一個"],"include":["包括"],"fourth":["第四"],"impetus":["推動力"],"sound":["健康"],"expand":["擴大"],"five":["五"],"base":["基地"],"driven":["推動"],"operation":["運作"],"announced":["宣布"],"representing":["標誌著"],"coming":["未來"],"reached":["達到"],"greater":["更大"],"province":["省"],"enhance":["提升"],"January":["1月"],"expanding":["拓寬"],"underpinned":["支持"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"uphold":["維護"],"among":["之中"],"convenient":["便捷"],"face":["面對"],"Behind":["背後"],"slightly":["微升"],"way":["方式"],"positive":["正面"],"assisted":["協助"],"recently":["最近"],"gathering":["聚會"],"advantage":["優勢"],"high-interestrate":["高息"],"continuing":["繼續"],"estimated":["估計"],"Embracing":["擁抱"],"unfolded":["發展"],"conclusion":["舉行"],"adoption":["應用"],"enhanced":["提升"],"maintains":["維持"],"sophisticated":["高端"],"eight":["8"],"notable":["顯著"],"ensure":["確保"],"5.5":["5.5%"],"risk-based":["風險為本"],"multiple":["多個"],"fifth":["五周年"],"second":["第2屆"],"lessons":["經驗"],"demonstrates":["展現"],"makes":["取得"],"implementing":["實施"],"counterparts":["有關當局"],"parties":["第三方"],"strengthening":["加強"],"also":["亦"],"completing":["完成"],"demonstrating":["展現"],"widen":["擴大"],"successful":["順利"],"stable":["穩健"],"developing":["制定"],"alongside":["隨着"],"enters":["進入"],"functionalities":["功能"],"make":["取得"],"provided":["提供"],"intensified":["加強"],"ledger":["分類帳"],"Figures":["數字"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"views":["意見"],"build":["建立"],"works":["工作"],"made":["取得"],"Highlights":["摘要"],"mostly":["大部分時間"],"usage":["使用率"],"introdu

企業管治\n\n作為香港的中央銀行機構，金管局致力於保持高標準的公司治理，因為良好的治理對維持和保護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信心至關重要。\n\n為履行其對良好企業管治的承諾，香港金融管理局（HKMA）：\n- 制定清晰的治理結構，並保持高度的问责程度；\n- 實施強健的控制機制以管理風險，並確保各級員工行為及日常運作均符合指定標準；以及\n- 奉行高透明度和保持開放的政策，並與持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# HKMA 與 香港特別行政區政府\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）是香港特別行政區（HKSAR）政府的一部分，但能夠以與公務員不同的條件聘請員工，以便吸引具備適當經驗和專門知識的人員。香港金融管理局局長及其員工均為公職人員。在香港金融管理局的日常工作中，其運作在貨幣管理局授予或轉授的相關法定權力範圍內，享有高度自主權。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體系結構：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致貨幣當局的一封信中訂明，這些目標應為貨幣穩定，即透過貨幣局安排維持港元兌一美元約7.80的穩定匯率。貨幣當局自身負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括釐定達成目標的策略、工具及操作手段。貨幣當局亦有責任維持香港貨幣體系的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財政及庫務局局長的協助下，負責制定政策以維持香港金融體系的穩定與健全，以及香港作為國際金融中心的地位。為支持這些政策，貨幣管理局的職責包括：

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource:

經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外部環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在2023年錄得正面增長，歸功於入境旅遊和內地需求的復甦。勞動市場隨着經濟復甦持續改善，而通脹則維持溫和。在金融條件收緊及市場情緒疲弱的情況下，資產市場依然疲軟。預計2024年的經濟活動將以溫和步伐進一步復甦，儘管前景因多個外部不明朗因素而蒙上陰影。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n在應對去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟於2023年穩步增長3.2%（表1和圖1）。在本地方面，私人消費在勞動市場條件改善及政府推出多項支持措施（如消費券計劃及一系列推廣活動）的推動下顯著復甦。儘管金融條件收緊，整體投資支出在與去年低基數比較的情況下錄得重大增長。對外方面，香港服務出口因入境旅遊強勁復甦而回升。然而，其對增長的正面影響被出境旅遊強勁復甦（以服務進口衡量）所抵銷。另一方面，在外需疲弱的情況下，貨物出口依然疲弱，拖累香港本地生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖1

通貨膨脹\n\n2023年本地通貨膨脹維持溫和，因外部價格壓力逐步緩解，儘管經濟復甦導致國內成本壓力略微上升，但整體仍大致受控（圖2）1。2023全年核心與整體通貨膨脹率分別為1.7%和2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2023年勞動市場情況進一步改善，7月份失業率降至近十年低位2.8%，其後幾個月均維持在低水平（圖3）。勞動需求和勞動供給分別反映在總就業人數增加（圖3）及勞動力增加。鑒於香港人力資源短缺，政府於2023年推出了不同輸入勞工計劃3及吸引人才措施4。與此同時，由於勞動市場緊張，名義工資及勞動收入的同比增長率逐步朝疫情前水平回升。\n\n圖2 核心消費者物價上漲\n\n圖3 勞動市場狀況 資料來源：統計處\n\n# 股票市場\n\n在2023年初穩定後，本地股市於下半年轉為呆滯。繼2022年底反彈後，恆生指數於2023年1月27（1月27日）以22,689點的全年高位收市。其後回落，並進一步下跌至12月（圖4）的低點，反映市場情緒疲弱，原因是美國及瑞士3月的銀行業問題，以及全球經濟前景轉弱和下半年金融環境收緊。恆生指數全年收市報17,047點，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，標誌連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 房地产市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2023年首4個月因內地及香港復常而反彈，但其後隨着按揭利率上升及市場情緒疲弱，價格進一步回落。整體而言，2023年樓價同比下跌6.9%，而樓宇交易量進一步下跌4.5%，創紀錄新低43,002個單位。儘管樓價向下調整，房屋可負擔性仍維持緊張，但微升。同樣地，非住宅物業市場持續面對逆風，寫字樓、零售舖位及廠房價格進一步回落。寫字樓租金持續承受壓力，因居家辦公安排日益普及及供應量大，導致高空置率。另一方面，零售舖位租金在2023年因入境旅遊復甦及私人消費改善而上升。\n\n圖4 資產價格  \n資料來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有有限公司\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2024年，香港經濟預計將以溫和步伐繼續復甦。入境旅遊將隨着接待能力的持續改善及政府推動盛事的工作而進一步擴大，而本地消費活動則應受惠於穩定的勞動市場。政府將推進的不同基礎設施項目亦將為經濟提供支持。與此同時，香港的貨物出口料將隨着全球科技週期預計的復甦而回穩。政府預測2024年實質GDP將穩步增長2.5%至3.5%。然而，前景因多個風險和不明朗因素而蒙上陰影，包括來自美國政策利率路徑、科技週期復甦步伐、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢等因素。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2024年本地通脹將保持溫和，外圍物價壓力回落將協助抵銷在進一步經濟復甦和房屋租金上漲情況下國內成本的上漲壓力。市場共識預測2024年整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府預計整體通脹率和核心通脹率將分別為2.4%和1.7%。另一方面，勞動市場將受到持續經濟復甦的支持，同時各項不同勞工輸入及人才吸引方案將繼續協助紓緩不同行業的人力短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n2023年，香港銀行業面臨多項挑戰，包括高利率環境、美國及歐洲三月銀行危機引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及內地和香港經濟復甦較預期緩慢。儘管面對這些多個逆風因素，香港銀行業仍維持健康，並持續受益於雄厚的資本和流動性緩衝。儘管分類貸款比率有所增加，銀行業的資產質素仍維持健康。銀行的盈利能力顯著改善，受較高淨息收入推動。\n\n#資產品質\n\n銀行業分類貸款比率由2022年底的1.40%上升至2023年底的1.56%，同期逾期及重組貸款比率亦由0.85%增加至1.24%（圖5）。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率亦由2022年底的2.26%上升至2023年底的2.58%。分類貸款比率的增加主要由於對內地房地產開發商風險評級的下調。然而，銀行撥備的數額維持足夠。截至2023年底，撥備覆蓋率（即總撥備與分類貸款的比率）為75%。若考慮分類貸款所擔保的抵押品市場價值，經調整的撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。與此同時，截至2023年底，住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率分別為0.08%及0.30%，維持在低水平（圖6）。\n\n圖5

盈利能力趨勢\n\n金融業在2023年錄得顯著的利潤增長。零售銀行的稅前營運利潤總額在當年增加62.1%，而同期平均資產的稅後報酬率則從0.57%上升至0.89%（圖7）。利潤的改善主要是由於淨利息收入增加30%，以及與去年相比，2023年交易性投資產生重大收益，而去年則為溫和虧損。此增長部分被貸款減值費用增加28%所抵銷，因針對新分類貸款設立了特定撥備。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨息差從一年前的1.31%擴大至2023年的1.68%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行的成本收入比從2022年的48.0%下降至2023年的38.8%（圖9）。\n\n圖7

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the

貨幣穩定\n\n2023年，在市場預期美國政策利率將「維持高水準較長時間」的情況下，港元大部分時間交易於可兌換範圍的疲弱一方，自2月中至5月初，疲弱一方的可兌換承擔機制被觸發8次。自5月以來，港元已回升一些動能，年底時交易約在7.8的中心平價水平。聯繫匯率制度於2023年迎來其40周年紀念，根據該制度，香港銀行同業拆借利率通常追蹤其美元對應物，亦受本地供應與需求影響。整體而言，港元匯兌及貨幣市場維持穩健，交易過程暢順且有秩序。作為香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢次體現其應對不同外部衝擊的強韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定被定義為香港貨幣在對美元的外匯市場匯率方面保持穩定的外部價值，即在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的波動範圍內。貨幣體系的結構採用貨幣局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由存放在外匯基金的美元儲備資產支持，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變化都必須由美元儲備資產的相應變化來完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括以下內容：\n- 債務證書，為三家發行銀行發行的紙幣提供全面支持；\n- 流通中的政府發行紙幣及硬幣；\n- 總餘額，即設於香港金融管理局（HKMA）的清算賬戶餘額總和；以及\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund Bills and Notes（EFBNs）。\n\n港元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制，以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行可換兌承諾（CUs）來維持。當強方（或弱方）可換兌承諾被觸發時，香港金融管理局準備應銀行要求，以每美元7.75港元（或7.85港元）的匯率向（或從）銀行沽出（或買入）港元，總餘額將會擴大（或收縮），以壓低（或推高）港元利率，協助將港元匯率回復至7.75至7.85的可換兌範圍內。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定性\n\n在市場預期美國政策利率將維持較高水平的情況下，港元全年大部分時間持續疲弱，並主要交易於可兌換範圍的弱方。自2月中至5月初，弱方兌換率共觸發8次。港元匯率於5月初至7月期間有所回升，部分由上市公司派發股息相關需求及企業半年底資金需求所推動。其後，港元主要由本地資金需求的變化所推動，例如南向股票通的買入資金流動，並於年底時段交易於7.8的中心平價附近（圖1）。整體而言，港元匯率市場於2023年全年持續正常運作。\n\n圖1 2023年市場匯率\n\n從二月至五月，香港金融管理局 (HKMA) 根據聯繫匯率制度 (LERS) 的設計，在銀行的要求下，以弱方貨幣單位買入總計515億港元。反映弱方貨幣單位的觸發，總準備金從2022年底的963億港元下跌至2023年底的450億港元。與此同時，全年未償還EFBNs從12,004億港元微升至12,455億港元。因此，總準備金與未償還EFBNs的總額從2022年底的12,967億港元下跌至2023年底的12,904億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎維持由外匯儲備充分支持。\n\n圖2 2023年貼現窗口前總餘額及未償還外匯基金證券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS），香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBORs）一般跟隨其美元對應指數（有關當局）。由於美國在2023年頭七個月持續上調利率，HIBORs一般也上升（圖3）。全年來看，隔夜、1個月及3個月HIBORs分別上升286、92及16個基點，至年底分別為6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n在美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍增設後，基準利率上調四次，總計提高1個百分點（即100個基點），從4.75%上調至5.75%。在零售方面，跟隨美國政策利率上調後，多間銀行在5月初將最高貸款利率提高12.5個基點，並在7月底再提高12.5個基點。一些銀行亦在當年提高新核准按揭貸款中以HIBOR為基礎的按揭利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續正常運作。貼現窗借款由2022年的84億港元增至2023年的388億港元，相關使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖3 2023年香港銀行間拆借利率\n\n# 掛鈎匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）在過去四十年間一直是香港金融體系的雄厚支柱，並體現其強大與韌性以應對各種挑戰。儘管持續存在的不確定因素圍繞美國利率路徑及全球經濟復甦，香港美元匯兌及貨幣市場仍持續以有秩序的方式運作，反映LERS的穩健性。特區政府堅決致力於LERS。在2023年外匯部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）再次重申，LERS的可信性已透過一套透明的規則、大量財政及外匯儲備、雄厚的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政框架得以確保。\n\n一個穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續暢順運作，流動性狀況及資本充足率按國際標準表現非常良好。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監測銀行在信貸、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果方面的表現，並維持對銀行貸款的監管努力。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的特定部分配置用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產劃分貨幣基礎）由2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的高達112.71%，超越了112.5%的上限觸發水平（圖4）。這主要反映了由於年初弱方觸發CU的啟動，總餘額收縮的結果。根據外匯基金諮詢委員會核准的安排，以及債務證書的贖回，資產從支持組合轉移至投資組合，使支持比率於5月8日降至約109.97%。其後，支持比率穩步上升，於12月31日收於110.73%。根據LERS，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。外匯基金充足的財務資源，配合健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖4

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans

銀行業穩定性\n\n儘管面臨多個挑戰，包括美國及歐洲三月的銀行風暴、高利率環境及地緣政治緊張局勢，香港銀行業在2023年仍維持雄厚且具韌性。香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速應對三月的銀行風暴，從管理餘波至完成內部檢討（涵蓋監管程序及解決框架等範疇），為本地銀行業汲取經驗，同時維持其重點在於授權機構的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益嚴重，以及第三方提供的科技服務使用量增加，HKMA亦與授權機構緊密合作，以提升其營運及網絡韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局在支付卡方面提升消費者保護，並通過進一步修訂《銀行業守則》以及推出《反詐騙消費者保護公約》。香港金融管理局與其他監管機構合作，為虛擬資產相關活動建立平衡的監管制度，簡化高端專業投資者的銷售流程，推出《跨境理財通試點計劃》的提升措施，並開始監管信託業務。為準備提供「信貸數據智能」下的消費者信貸參考服務，推出了試點計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）在反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面的努力展現了其承諾，以風險為本的策略應對最高威脅。為應對日益增加的數字詐騙，香港金融管理局透過推出即時欺詐監測，並拓寬公私部門資訊共享合作的範圍，包括成立「欺詐及洗錢情報工作組」，以加強生態系統合作。推出一個突破性平台，便利銀行間資訊共享，將有助應對人頭帳戶網絡的風險。同時，香港金融管理局亦與業界緊密合作，採取協同行動處理日益增加的與欺詐相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對不同詐騙手法的意識，包括在使用快速支付系統時設有交易前警示機制。與此同時，亦透過宏觀分析試點計劃提升監管科技能力。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露要求等。亦在加強銀行業能力建設、吸引和培育未來人才以及提升現有專業人員技能方面作出顯著努力。此外，香港存款保障局已完成就建議提升存款保障計劃的公眾諮詢。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續推動其工作，以確保一個可信的解決方案制度。制定了一項與接觸關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關的新解決方案標準，並完成了對實施損失吸收能力政策標準經驗的審視。與銀行合作的解決方案規劃取得了重大進展，以應對解決方案中的提前終止風險和運作連續性。香港金融管理局亦持續積極參與國際政策倡議及區域解決方案合作。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）有一個普遍的目標，即推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。達成此目標取決於一個具極高韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟所需的重要金融服務。\n\n銀行可以透過其經營業務的方式影響系統的穩定性，並在極端情況下，以失序的方式失敗。貨幣當局作為監管機構，透過確保銀行對震盪具韌性，並能在危機中復甦其狀況，擔當保護金融穩定的關鍵角色，最終協助預防失敗。貨幣當局負責銀行的審慎監管，並負責認可香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（AIs）。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣當局作為解決機構，旨在確保在人工智能機構變得不可持續經營時，其倒閉可有秩序地進行管理。為此，香港已建立針對金融機構的解決機制，其中貨幣當局是人工智能機構及其他類別機構的解決機構。為在香港落實解決機制，制定解決規則和政策標準至關重要，需進行解決規劃以消除人工智能機構可解決性的障礙，並發展香港金融管理局解決失敗人工智能機構的運作能力。為有效執行這些工作，香港金融管理局採用國際協調一致的方法。\n\n貨幣當局亦負責若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定及監察。在監察FMIs時，香港金融管理局（HKMA）旨在推動其普遍的安全與效率，限額系統性風險並促進透明度。制定FMIs更具韌性以應對金融危機，可保護香港的貨幣及金融系統免受FMIs中斷所引致的可能不穩定影響。\n\n# 2023年回顧\n\n# 授權\n\n在本年內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）向兩間在香港境外註冊的銀行授予一個銀行牌照及一個限制性銀行牌照。香港金融管理局亦向四間外國交易平台營運商授予貨幣經紀批准，並撤銷另一次授予一個貨幣經紀的批准。香港金融管理局在本年內撤銷五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n更多關於AIs及香港當地代表辦事處的資訊可查閱附錄及表格D至F，分別位於第313至316頁及第322至325頁。\n\n# 三層銀行體系檢討\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局進行了一項全面審查，以便簡化香港銀行體系的結構。審查查閱到三層銀行體系已變得比必要更複雜，以取得原來的目標，即在銀行體系入行靈活性與保護小存款人之間取得平衡。其後，香港金融管理局於6月開始進行三個月的諮詢，就簡化三層銀行體系為兩層的建議進行磋商，即通過將存款機構合併至受限制牌照銀行部門，從而形成香港銀行體系的新第2屆。回應者在更廣泛層面支持該建議。\n\n# 監督活動概述\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了177項遠程審查，涵蓋廣泛的種類問題，包括CAMEL評分評估1、公司治理及風險管理。作為HKMA持續推動更強風險治理的 effort（努力）的一部分，與銀行的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事會級別委員會舉行了38場會議。此外，在HKMA、AI及其外部審計師之間舉行了38場三方會議。\n\n除了遠程活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）亦進行定期現場檢查，範圍涵蓋廣泛的持牌機構活動。信貸風險管理是重點，因在高息率環境及部分內地房地產發展商違約的情況下，信貸風險環境充滿挑戰。操作風險及科技風險的管理亦是另一重點，因持牌機構應用科技的趨勢進一步加速。香港金管局亦加強其對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出新的一輪主題檢查，專注於氣候相關風險治理，以及一連串諮詢環節，以向持牌機構提供監管指引。\n\n2023年3月開始的美國及歐洲銀行危機，就規模和範圍而言，是自2008年重大金融危機以來最重大的系統性銀行壓力。在危機發展期間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）保持高警戒狀態，並採取多項預防行動，以確保任何潛在後果不會影響本地銀行及金融體系的信心。事件後，HKMA進行內部檢討，顧及從危機中獲得的觀察和經驗。基於此檢討，HKMA制定詳細行動計劃，納入所學經驗，以加強監管有效性，並提升處理銀行危機的能力。詳情請參閱第95頁的流動性及市場風險。\n\n在香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行監管方面，其在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務以及消費者保護事項上進行現場檢查，並輔以針對評估為風險較高或新措施的範疇進行主題性審查。\n\n表1載有HKMA於2023年的監管活動概要。\n\n表1 監督活動概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產質量\n\n總貸款額在2023年減少3.6%，相比2022年的3.0%下跌。表2列明貸款和推進的增長細節。內地相關貸款在2023年減少6.6%，達到4,226億港元（表3）。\n\n表2 貸款和推進的增長\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局在高利率環境及內地樓市持續疲弱的情況下，加強監管努力，監測銀行機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理實務。銀行業的資產質素在當年惡化，但維持在可控範圍內。截至2023年底，銀行業的分類貸款比率為1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%上升。內地相關貸款的分類貸款比率則由2022年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局進行了針對性及主題性的檢查，以評估持牌機構的信貸風險管理，重點關注對易受影響行業的風險敞口、優先融資、對香港以外業務信貸風險的監管，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 緩解銀行客戶所面臨的現金流壓力\n\n香港金融管理局與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制於7月宣布，開始有序退出預核准本金支付假期計劃。該計劃於2020年5月推出，旨在幫助合資格企業渡過疫情。鑑於商業界的意見，部分本金還款選項已得到提升，以協助企業逐步回歸正常還款。儘管疫情已結束，若行業或個別借款人仍面臨挑戰，銀行將持續根據個別案例提供本金寬限期或其他適當的信貸緩衝措施。\n\n香港金管局亦鼓勵銀行在接待資金需求時對未參與該計劃但因個別情況而面臨現金流壓力的企業表現同理心。香港金管局提醒銀行在處理企業遇到償還問題時，應跟隨《企業困難的香港方法》指引，以便個別銀行能在貸款人共同利益的常見利益中行事協作。\n\n# 房地产抵押貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）推出的多輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，加強了銀行對物業按揭貸款業務的風險管理，以及銀行業應對物業價格急劇回落所帶來挑戰的能力。2023年核准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）維持在57%，相比2009年9月逆週期措施首次推出時的64%（圖1）。2023年新按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率（DSR）保持低於40%，相比2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%。\n\n鑑於樓價、交易量以及本地和外圍經濟環境等因素，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於7月7日調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。這是在2009年推出住宅物業逆周期宏觀審慎措施以來的首次放寬。調整內容包括提高住宅物業及商業物業的最高貸款與價值比率（LTV），以及基於抵押貸款申請人淨資產評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款與價值比率。此外，取消了對主要收入來自香港以外地方的按揭申請人，需將適用的最高貸款與價值比率及供款與入息比率（DSR）限額降低10個百分點的要求。HKMA亦取消了當申請人的總按揭貸款超過其正常可接受的貸款與價值比率上限20個百分點時，需對適用的供款與入息比率限額實施五個百分點減幅的要求。\n\n圖1

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. The sixth Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial Dialogue was held in Bern, Switzerland on 25 September, and the discussion covered topics on regional and domestic outlook and policy challenges, latest development, and potential collaboration in the areas of sustainable finance, fintech, and market connectivity.\n\n# A glance at the HKMA’s initiatives in 2023 in strengthening Hong Kong’s

國際金融中心\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局採用多管齊下的方法，取得顯著進展，以鞏固香港作為全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位。\n\n兩項重大活動的成功，即全球金融領導人投資峰會及香港金管局與BIS的高層次會議，已鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，並產生正面的連鎖反應。\n\n香港金融管理局與內地及香港有關當局作出協力努力，以深化及擴大香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。這包括在粵港澳大灣區內對跨境理財通計劃進行提升，為債券通南向交易指定額外做市商，順利推出掉期通北向交易，以及推出港元人民幣雙櫃台模式和雙櫃台做市計劃。這些措施有效加強香港的門戶地位，並鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務全球樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局亦在香港金融平台競爭力的加強方面取得良好進展，範疇包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色及可持續金融，以及企業現金管理中心等。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強了對海外及內地持份者的市場推廣活動，以保持他們對香港金融市場的機會及其韌性有充分了解。\n\n在港銀聯「Fintech 2025」策略的所有範疇都取得了重大進展，包括在推動金融科技應用、中央銀行數字貨幣、數據基礎設施、人才發展以及政策和資金支持等範疇。\n\n更快支付系統（FPS）於9月慶祝其五周年。註冊數字穩步增長，截至2023年底已達到13.6百萬。全年平均每日成交額上升至1.25百萬筆即時交易。FPS x PromptPay跨境QR支付連結於12月與泰國央行聯合推出，為來往兩地的人士提供快速、安全且方便的跨境零售支付服務。\n\n作為多間國際及地區性央行及監管組織的積極成員，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續為全球維持金融穩定及推動金融市場發展的努力作出貢獻。\n\n# 概述\n\n全年期間，香港金管局持續積極努力，加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在11月，金管局舉辦了第2屆全球金融領袖投資峰會。這個為期三天的活動匯聚了來自世界各地的知名金融領袖，以「與複雜性共存」為主題，分享他們獨特的視野。有來自160間國際金融機構的逾350名參加者出席，峰會清楚展示了全球金融界對香港的承諾和信心。同年同月，金管局與國際清算銀行（BIS）共同舉辦了金管局-BIS高層會議，吸引了逾3,000億名參與者，包括逾20位現任及前央行總裁。會議凸顯了金管局與BIS以及國際央行界的緊密合作。\n\nMainland Hong Kong Connect 方案的擴展及提升強化了香港作為內地與國際金融市場之間橋樑的角色。一連串針對跨境理財通（Cross-boundary WMC）方案的提升已推出，以便利粵港澳大灣區（GBA）內跨境零售投資。乘著南向債券通的暢順運作，香港金融管理局指定九間額外做市商，以改善二級市場流動性並符合投資者需求。今年成功推出 Swap Connect 的北向交易，讓全球投資者能透過香港更好地管理與其內地固定收益投資組合相關的利率風險。\n\n香港的離岸人民幣業務在本年見證了強勁的增長。香港金融管理局（HKMA）與證券及期貨事務監理委員會（SFC）及香港交易及結算所有有限公司（HKEX）合作，於6月推出了HKD-RMB雙櫃台模式及雙櫃台做市商計劃。這幫助香港發展出更多元化的人民幣等值產品，透過促進在香港發行及交易人民幣等值股票。\n\n香港金融管理局持續工作，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其為提升香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，提供更便利的稅務和監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新方面亦取得重大進展，並鞏固香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位。同時，香港金融管理局加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地的利益相關方推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n香港金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）及香港金融管理局（HKMA）的銀行部門持續推行「金融科技2025」策略1，以推動金融科技（fintech）的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。本年度重點措施包括：\n- 推動在重點科技領域（包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智慧及分布式賬本技術（DLT））的進一步應用；\n- 推進批發央行數字貨幣（CBDC）的工作，以改善跨境支付；\n- 在研究在香港引入零售CBDC（即e-HKD）前景方面取得進一步進展；\n- 加大推動商業數據交換（CDI）的力度；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 透過資金和政策培育金融科技生態系統；\n- 加強金融科技領域的跨境合作；以及\n- 擴大FPS的應用。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，對維持香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位至關重要。2023年，4項銀行間即時全額結算（RTGS）系統、中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）及香港交易存管處（HKTR）達成100%2系統可用率，超越99.95%的目標。債務證券結算服務，包括北向及南向債券通對接服務，持續暢順運作。\n\nFPS的應用在2023年持續增加，標誌著FPS達成五周年的重要里程碑。FPS的註冊人數及成交額在過去五年間穩步增長，截至2023年底，註冊人數已增長至1360萬，年平均每日成交額較2022年上升33%。FPS在繳納政府費用、商戶付款以及為儲值設施（SVF）電子錢包或銀行賬戶增值等方面的使用增加，成為交易量持續上升的主要推動因素，除了個人對個人及商業支付的穩步增長之外。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業界的安全部分及效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監督六項指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並監管17間持牌儲值支付工具發行機構（SVF）（其中四間為持牌銀行發行的SVF）。在本年度內，HKMA亦持續便利政府消費券計劃的暢順執行，協助協調相關政府部門及為該計劃而委任的SVF持牌機構，並促進雙方的對話與合作。\n\n於12月27（1月27日），財政司司庫局與香港金融管理局（HKMA）聯合發佈有關穩定幣發行機構監管的公眾諮詢文件。其後，HKMA於2024年3月12日推出沙盒安排，針對計劃在香港發行法幣掛鉤穩定幣的機構。同時，HKMA積極參與國際機構在加密資產活動方面的相關工作，並緊密監測市場發展。\n\n在國際上，香港金融管理局（HKMA）維持積極的中央銀行界成員資格，並持續在多個區域及國際委員會中發揮領導作用。現正，HKMA共同擔任巴塞爾銀行監理委員會（Basel Committee）政策與標準小組的主席，以及亞洲區域諮詢小組、非銀行監測專家小組（直至6月）和金融穩定理事會（FSB）金融創新網絡的主席。HKMA亦擔任國際清算銀行（BIS）主要新興市場經濟體總督會議的主席。2018年至2023年間，HKMA在東亞及太平洋中央銀行總裁會議（EMEAP）下建立的金融市場工作小組中，連續擔任主席一職。\n\n香港金融管理局亦分別於五月份與阿聯酋中央銀行及七月份與沙特阿拉伯中央銀行舉行雙邊會議，以推動亞洲與中東之間的投資及金融市場連通性。第六次香港-瑞士金融對話於9月25日在瑞士伯爾尼舉行，討論涵蓋區域及本地展望與政策挑戰、最新發展，以及在可持續金融、金融科技及市場連通性等範疇的潛在合作。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2023.\n\nSee pages 205 to 311 for the audited 2023 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the

備付金管理\n\n2023年的投資環境動盪且充滿挑戰。雖然美國和歐洲的一些銀行在年初出現流動性問題，但相關風險並未蔓延至金融市場。儘管主要發達經濟體的通脹水平已從2023年的高位下跌，但仍然維持在主要央行設立的目標之上。在經歷了一輪進取的加息週期後，美國聯邦儲備委員會自第三季起暫停加息，並表示政策利率可能已接近或達到其峰值。這一點，以及美國經濟具韌性，使投資者情緒更加樂觀。然而，持續的地緣政治緊張局勢，例如俄烏戰爭以及當年中東地區衝突的爆發，為投資市場增添了波動和不明朗因素。在這個複雜且多變的投資環境中，Exchange Fund的投資表現經歷了一些起伏。儘管如此，Exchange Fund仍成功取得了良好的投資回報。2023年，Exchange Fund錄得2,260億港元的投資收益，標誌著5.5%的投資回報率。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n根據《儲備基金條例》制定，儲備基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響港元匯率。基金亦可能用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以便協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局在財政司司長轉授的權限及轉授權限的條件下，就儲備基金的使用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標和組合結構\n\nExchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) 已為 Exchange Fund 設立以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；  \n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都充分由極高流通性的美元等值資產支持；  \n(iii) 確保足夠的流動性可用於維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及  \n(iv) 受(i)至(iii)限制，取得投資回報以協助保障Exchange Fund的長期購買力量。\n\n這些目標採取全面考慮Exchange Fund的法定目的，並註冊到基金的投資組合結構和目標資產組合中（圖1）。\n\n圖1 交易所基金組合分離\n\n廣義而言，儲備基金擁有兩大投資組合：支持組合（BP）及投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有極高流通性的美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供全面支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員經濟體的債券及股票市場，旨在保障資產價值及其長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並在中長期提升回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以審慎和循序漸進的方式，將香港外匯基金的部分投資多元化至更廣泛的多樣化資產類別。這些包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由IP持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置同時確定，受審慎風險管理原則和組合多元化策略的限制。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年建立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司購入的股份，這些股份是政府為證券投資基金帳戶以戰略目的購入的。由於其獨特性，戰略投資組合未被刊載於基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# Exchange Fund 的投資配置\n\n匯換基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的資金存放。利率更廣泛層面與投資組合1的表現掛鈎。一個主要的個別例子是未來基金2，其利率根據投資組合配置與投資組合1及LTGP的回報掛鈎。未來基金在投資組合1與LTGP之間的投資組合配置於2023年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n香港儲備基金的投資過程由兩種資產配置決策所支持：戰略性資產配置與戰略性資產配置。戰略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表基於香港儲備基金投資目標的長期資產配置。以戰略性配置為指引，資產會戰略性配置以爭取超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置往往與基準（或戰略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰術偏差」。雖然基準與循跡誤差3的限額是由財政司長與儲備基金管理委員會磋商後釐定，但戰略性決策及戰術偏差的容許範圍則由香港金融管理局在轉授權力下制定。在戰術偏差容許範圍內，投資組合經理可能管理頭寸以利用短期市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的外匯基金投資辦公室專責管理外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的職員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括整個BP及IP的一部分。由內部管理的IP部分包括設立的一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及不同衍生工具疊加投資組合，用以實施為基金制定的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦僱用外部資產管理人，管理約29%的儲備基金資產，包括所有上市股本投資組合及其他專門資產類別。聘用外部管理人的目的是汲取市場上最高水平的投資專門知識，以獲取可持續的回報，同時亦汲取多元化且互補的投資方式，並善用外部市場見解及專門的投資知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人相關的支出包括基金管理及保管費用、交易成本以及扣留稅及其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素釐定，且可能每年有所不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n隨著投資環境越見複雜，良好的風險管理日益重要。香港金融管理局（HKMA）為其內部及對外管理的投資組合設定嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並確保妥善的風險監察及合規系統已經建立。為推行有效的風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已設有三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信貸、市場、流動性及操作風險）會定期監察。風險管理過程規定了一個穩健的架構，以支持香港金融管理局的戰略規劃及投資多元化努力。\n\n# 負責任的投資\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）相信，適當強調責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，可協助更好取得 Exchange Fund 的投資目標，同時減低與其基層投資所涉及的環境、社會及治理（ESG）相關事項的風險。為積極支持責任投資實踐，HKMA 已將 ESG 因素併入 Exchange Fund 的投資流程，其指導性原則為，若 ESG 投資的長期風險調整後回報相若於其他投資，更廣泛層面會給予 ESG 投資優先。如需了解更多關於 HKMA 責任投資工作的詳情，請參閱《可持續發展報告 2023》中的「責任投資」章節。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2023年金融市場\n\n2023年的投資環境充滿動盪和挑戰。\n\n全球股市在2023年更廣泛層面呈現向上趨勢。標普500指數在當年上漲了24%，加上在第四季市場開始預期比預期更快的減息。\n\n在債券市場中，收益率維持在高水平，10年期美國國債收益率一度突破5%，達到自2007年以來的最高水平。然而，隨著市場對央行貨幣政策預期的改變，債券收益率在年底回落，同時債券價格逐步上漲。\n\n在外匯市場中，美元對主要貨幣錄得不一的表現。其中，英鎊和歐元對美元升值，而日圓和人民幣則貶值。\n\n2023年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現體現在表1中。\n\n表1

The HKMA’s major summit and conferences, including the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, are livestreamed on its social media channels to enhance participation by the public and the industry. The HKMA also develops creative social media content to raise public awareness on a range of topics and initiatives. Recent content covered topics such as consumer protection and scam prevention, the Faster Payment System, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and major events of the HKMA.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe HKMA’s Public Enquiry Service provides an effective channel for the public looking to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Public Enquiry Service handled 9,565 enquiries. About half of these were related to consumer banking issues, banking policies and regulations, financial infrastructure and debt market development, and notes and coins. Some of the common subjects of enquiries concerned banking products and services, the Coin Collection Programme, the Retail Bond Issuance Programme, banking-related guidelines and circulars, and the Faster Payment System.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received by the Public Enquiry Service since 2020, and Chart 2 provides a breakdown of the nature of enquiries received in 2023.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2023\n\n# Publications\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA published its Annual Report 2022 along with its first standalone Sustainability Report 2022. The Annual Report 2022 received a Gold Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organizations” category, the highest ranking within the category, at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2023 Best Annual Reports Awards. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Report 2022 won the ESG Award in the Public Sector\/Not-for-profit (Large) Category of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA published two issues of its Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of its Quarterly Bulletin, and regularly updated its Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information on and analyses of monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 14 inSight1 articles in which it introduced major new policies and initiatives and discussed topical issues.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with nearly 60,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance (BO), as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) in phases since 2018. By the end of 2023, the HKMA had opened up 175 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with its target schedule.\n\nThe HKMA’s Open API portal:\n\n# Information Centre\n\nLocated on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, the HKMA Information Centre consists of an exhibition area and a library designed to introduce the work of the HKMA to the community and enhance public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The interactive exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work, and of the development of money and banking in Hong Kong, along with information and exhibits useful for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nDuring the year, the Information Centre welcomed more than 31,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups.\n\nThe library, next to the exhibition area, houses over 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.

To date, more than 66,000 people have participated in the public education programme. In 2023, a webinar was organised for over 1,200 students and teachers from 58 secondary schools. The webinar topics included an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme, green finance, and career opportunities in the banking industry.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers. In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems. Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in its day-to-day operations, and at a higher level through strategic planning. Two high-level committees, the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee, operate under the HKMA’s risk management framework. Both are chaired by the Chief Executive of the

透明度\n\n# 媒體關係和使用社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）緊密與媒體合作，以提升透明度並推動公眾對其政策及運作的了解。2023年，HKMA舉辦或參與了188場公開新聞活動，包括11場新聞發佈會、6場媒體簡報會、15場站立式訪問及其他156場公開活動。當年亦進一步安排了25場媒體訪問，發佈了583份雙語新聞公報，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高對香港金融管理局（HKMA）主要職能的意識，舉辦了針對本地、內地及外國媒體的記者會和媒體簡報會。話題包括反詐騙倡議、中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）和穩定幣。\n\n媒體代表是2023年由香港金管局舉辦活動的活躍參與者，尤其第2屆全球金融領導人投資峰會。這項三日活動在本地、內地及國際媒體產生超過2,000則正面、真實的新聞報導。\n\n葉奕雄先生，行政總裁，在香港FinTech

Chan（自左起第一），副行政長官，於2023年財政市場峰會主持委員會討論。\n\n創意社交媒體內容有助上調公眾對HKMA倡議及其他種類題目的意識。\n\n為更有效與公眾溝通，香港金融管理局（HKMA）運營六個社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、微信、X（原Twitter）及YouTube），統稱擁有逾150,000名追隨者。HKMA的主要峰會及會議，包括全球金融領導人投資峰會，均會在其社交媒體平台進行現場直播，以提升公眾及業界的參與度。HKMA亦開發創意的社交媒體內容，上調公眾對各種話題及倡議的意識。近期的內容涵蓋了包括消費者保護及詐騙預防、更快支付系統、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及HKMA的重要活動等話題。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的公眾查詢服務規定了一個有效渠道，讓公眾展望更好理解香港金融管理局（HKMA）的關鍵功能和運作。\n\n2023年，公眾查詢服務處理了9,565宗查詢。其中約一半涉及消費者銀行業務問題、銀行政策與法規、金融基礎設施及債務市場發展，以及紙幣和硬幣。一些常見的查詢主題涉及銀行產品及服務、硬幣收集計劃、零售債券發行計劃、與銀行相關的指引及通函，以及更快支付系統。\n\n圖1列明自2020年起公共查詢服務收到的查詢數字，而圖2規定2023年收到查詢的性質分類。\n\n圖1

出版物\n\n在該年度內，香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMA）載有其2022年度報告及首份獨立的2022年可持續發展報告。2022年度報告在「非牟利及慈善機構」類別中獲得金獎，為該類別內的最高排名，於香港管理協會2023年度最佳年度報告頒獎典禮中頒發。與此同時，2022年可持續發展報告在香港會計師公會2023年度最佳企業管治及ESG獎項中，於「公眾部門\/非牟利（大量）」類別中獲得了ESG獎項。\n\n2023年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）發佈了兩期《半年度貨幣及金融穩定報告》及4項《季度通訊》，並定期更新其《月度統計通訊》，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題資訊和分析。香港金融管理局亦發佈了14篇inSight1文章，其中推出重大新政策及措施，並討論重要議題。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n香港金融管理局（www.hkma.gov.hk）的企業網站，載有近六萬頁以英文、傳統中文及簡體中文編寫的內容，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。該網站載有根據《銀行條例》第20章維持的授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及AIs證券人員登記冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維持的儲值設施牌照持有人登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局自2018年起分階段在其網站上透過開放式應用程式介面（Open API）釋出財務數據及重要資訊。截至2023年底，香港金融管理局已在網站上開立175設定的開放式API，符合其目標時間表。\n\n香港金融管理局的開放API門戶：\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n位於兩國際金融中心55樓的香港金融管理局資訊中心，由展覽館及圖書館組成，旨在向社區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並提升公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的意識。互動展覽館展示香港金融管理局工作的概覽，以及香港貨幣及銀行業的發展，連同有助研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資料和展品。\n\n在這一年中，資訊中心接待超過31,000名訪客，並為學校及其他小組舉辦了超過480場以…為指引的導覽。\n\n圖書館緊鄰展覽館範圍，專責保管超過26,000本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，內容涵蓋香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行題目。亦根據BO第20章的要求，維持AI機構及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及AI機構證券人員的登記冊，供公眾查閱。\n\n年輕訪客在香港資訊中心的導賞中學習紙幣設計。\n\n以…為指引的資訊中心導賞，針對幼稚園學生\n\n# 社區聯繫與公眾教育\n\n自1998年起，香港金融管理局一直運行一個公眾教育計劃，接觸社區以提高公眾對其工作的意識。截至目前為止，已有超過66,000人參與了該公眾教育計劃。2023年，為來自58間中學的逾1,200名學生和教師舉辦了一個網上研討會。網上研討會的主題包括香港金融管理局的工作概述、掛鈎匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字鎖匙的保護、存款保障計劃、綠色金融以及銀行業的事業機會。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）致力教育及與公眾溝通，提高公眾對如何成為聰明及負責任的金融消費者之認識。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙及信用卡詐騙的上升，香港金融管理局持續透過不同媒體提醒公眾提高警覺。在推出《反詐騙消費者保護公約》後，推出了一項全新的意識提升運動，強調銀行及主要商戶已承諾不會透過即時電子訊息傳送超連結，要求提供個人及信用卡資料。香港金融管理局亦透過電台及社交媒體渠道傳達有關信用卡、個人貸款、網上購物、銀行服務及不同支付選項（包括「Buy Now, Pay

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

交易所基金\n\n# 審計主任報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 致財政司\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審核香港交易所基金及其附屬公司（「該小組」）設立於第211至311頁的財務報表，其中包括截至2023年12月31日止的香港交易所基金及該小組的資產負債表，以及其收入及支出賬戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表、現金流量表，以及截至該年為止的財務報表附註，包括重要的會計政策資訊。\n\n在我看來，財務報表就截至2023年12月31日基金及小組的財務地位，以及該年度截至當日止的財務表現及現金流量，均根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒布的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）作出真實和公允的反映，並已根據行政長官根據儲備基金條例（第66章）第7章頒布的指令妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7章頒布的指示以及審計委員會的審計標準進行了我的審計。我在這些標準下的職責進一步說明於我報告書中「審計師對財務報表審計的職責」一章。根據這些標準，我與集團保持獨立，並已根據這些標準履行了我的其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，可作為我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我對截至2023年12月31日止年度財務報表進行審計時，根據我的專業判斷，對我而言最重要的事項。這些事項是在審計整體財務報表的全年背景下進行解決的，並在我形成有關財務報表的意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包含刊載於香港貨幣當局2023年度報告中的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我不對此表示任何形式的保證舉行。\n\n在審計財務報表的過程中，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在這樣做時考慮這些其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否明顯存在重大錯誤。如果根據我所執行的工作，我得出結論認為這些其他資訊存在重大錯誤，則我必須報告這一情況。在這方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 貨幣當局與儲備基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會在財務報表方面的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會發佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《儲備基金條例》第7章由行政長官發出的指示，準備提供真實及公平觀點的財務報表，並負責貨幣管理局認為必要以使財務報表免於重大錯誤陳述（無論是因為欺詐還是錯誤）的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估小組繼續作為持續經營實體的能力，視情況而定披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n匯換基金顧問委員會的審計小組負責監察小組的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，以確認財務報表的全年是否免於重大錯報，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包括我意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高水準的保證，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計，將一直能發現存在時的重大錯報。錯報可能因舞弊或錯誤而出現，若個別或合併起來，可能合理地被預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所做出的經濟決定，則視為重大。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計標準進行審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷並在整個審計過程中維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表的重大錯報風險，不論係因舞弊或錯誤所致，並設計及執行針對該等風險的審計程序，以取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我提出意見的基礎。未能發現因舞弊導致的重大錯報風險，較因錯誤導致者為高，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制的行為；\n- 取得與審計相關的內部控制了解，以便設計適合情況的審計程序，但並非用於表達對集團內部控制有效性之意見；\n- 評估貨幣當局所採用會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計及相關揭露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎會計的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或狀況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，則必須在審計師報告中指出財務報表中相關的揭露，若該等揭露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計師報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或狀況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表整體的呈現、結構及內容，包括揭露，以及財務報表是否以達成公平呈現的方式反映其底層交易及事件；\n- 取得有關集團內各實體或業務活動財務資訊的足夠且適當審計證據，以便對財務報表提出意見。我對集團審計的指揮、監督及執行負有責任，並對我的審計意見負有唯一責任。\n\n我與財政儲備諮詢委員會審計小組委員會就審計的預計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，包括我在審計期間所識別的重大內部控制缺陷等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向匯換基金諮詢委員會的審計小組提供聲明，表明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向他們溝通所有可能合理地認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，如適用時，亦包括相關保障措施。\n\n從與財政儲備顧問委員會審計小組委員會的聯繫中所接獲的問題，我確定在本期財務報表審計中最具重大性的問題，因此為關鍵審計問題。我會在審計師報告中描述這些問題，除非法例或規則禁止就該問題進行公開披露，或在極為罕見的情況下，我確定某項問題不應在報告中進行通報，因為這樣做所產生的不利後果，合理預期會超過進行此類通報所帶來的公眾利益的裨益。\n\n教授林志遠 Nelson 審計總監\n\n# 1 主要活動\n\n貨幣管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（基金）管理人的轉授權力，根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動是保護香港貨幣的匯兌價值，並維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全。\n\n基金的資產分為四個組合進行管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。支持組合的資產在港元貨幣局制度下，完全與貨幣基礎相匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合持有香港交易及結算所有限公司為基金帳戶購入的股份，用於戰略目的。營運部門資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 2 重大會計政策\n\n# 2.1% 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表是根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，HKFRSs為一統稱，包括所有適用的個別HKFRSs、香港會計師公會（HKICPA）頒佈的香港會計準則及解釋，以及在香港更廣泛層面被接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬機構（合稱為小組）採用的重要會計政策如下所述。\n\n香港會計師公會（HKICPA）已頒佈若干新的或修訂的香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs），這些準則首次於集團本期會計期間生效或可供提前應用。第3註釋規定，如有因初步申請這些發展而導致會計政策的變更，則在這些財務報表所反映的本期及往期會計期間與集團相關的範圍內提供資訊。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表編製基礎\n\n小組財務報表包括小組的財務報表以及小組在聯營公司和合營企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合營企業的主要業務活動體現在附註16和17中。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，除以下按公允價值計量的資產和負債外：  \n- 衍生金融工具（註2.6）；  \n- 按公允價值透過損益帳戶計量的金融資產和金融負債（註2.6）；  \n- 按公允價值透過其他綜合收益計量的金融資產（註2.6）；  \n- 黃金（註2.10）；及  \n- 投資性不動產（註2.11）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製財務報表，需要管理層取得判斷、估計和假設，這些判斷、估計和假設會影響政策的申請以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。這些估計和相關假設是基於歷史經驗和不同其他因素，這些因素在當時的情況下被認為是合理的，其結果構成了取得判斷的基礎，用以評估資產和負債的攜帶價值，而這些價值從其他資料來源中並不容易明顯看出。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及相關假設會持續進行檢討。若會計估計的修訂僅影響該估計修訂的期間，則該修訂會於該期間內確認；若修訂同時影響當前及未來期間，則該修訂會於修訂期間及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層在 HKFRS 申請中取得的判斷，對財務報表產生重大生效，以及主要資料來源的估計不確定性，均在附註 2.18 中披露。\n\n若干比較數字已重新表述，以符合集團財務報表的本年度頒獎典禮。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是由小組控制的實體。小組在以下情況下控制實體：當其暴露於或擁有來自與該實體相關的變動回報的權利，並具備透過對該實體的控制來影響這些回報的能力。在評估小組是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由小組及其他第三方所持有）。\n"}
