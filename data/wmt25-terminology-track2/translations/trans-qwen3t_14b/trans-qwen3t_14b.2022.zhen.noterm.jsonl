{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 內地機遇\n","en":"2022 was a year of facing challenges head-on.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus wreaked havoc, continuing to pressure global economic growth while inflationary pressures kept rising. Subsequently, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine further intensified inflationary pressures, prompting major central banks to adopt preemptive monetary tightening policies, amplifying volatility in global financial markets and increasing the risk of economic slowdown. Locally, the fifth wave of the pandemic hit Hong Kong, with a rapid surge in infection cases further damaging the economy. Meanwhile, negative media coverage surrounding quarantine measures and restrictions deepened misunderstandings about Hong Kong abroad, threatening its reputation as an international financial center. For the full year, Hong Kong's real local gross domestic product contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, advancing multiple proactive measures across key strategic areas to further consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. Following three years of travel restrictions, we have successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully resumed normal operations, allowing tourists to once again visit in person and experience the city firsthand. Last November, the HKMA hosted the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" drawing financial leaders from around the world to attend in person. The enthusiastic response from the international community has served as the most compelling evidence of Hong Kong's full recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainties. Nevertheless, the resumption of mainland economic activity will reinvigorate Hong Kong and the broader region. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will continue to steadfastly fulfill its mandate of maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's currency and banking system, while actively seeking more opportunities to support Hong Kong's development and enhance its competitiveness as an international financial center. We will also continue to contribute to global climate resilience and sustainable development. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will issue a separate 2022 Sustainability Report this year to provide a more detailed overview of the HKMA's initiatives in strengthening Hong Kong's position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as the efforts made by the HKMA as a responsible investor and sustainable institution.\n\n# Monetary and Financial System: As Firm as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), implemented in 1983, has withstood multiple economic cycles and successfully resisted various external shocks. In 2022, the system's resilience was once again demonstrated. Amid the Federal Reserve's significant tightening of monetary policy, the weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner according to the established mechanism. During this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money market continued to operate smoothly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe confidence in the linked exchange rate system stems from its solid foundation built over many years. As reiterated by the International Monetary Fund in its 2022 External Sector Report, the credibility of the linked exchange rate system is based on multiple factors, including operation rules with high transparency, ample foreign exchange reserves, a prudent fiscal system, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to robust mechanisms, the dedication to communicating with the public and market to deepen their understanding of the linked exchange rate system, conducting effective market surveillance, and preparing contingency plans for different scenarios all contribute to strengthening confidence in the system. Our social media campaign launched to explain the operational mechanisms of the linked exchange rate system has helped effectively maintain market confidence, even during multiple triggers of the weak-side exchange guarantee this year. Internally, the HKMA has also effectively utilized data analytics technology to enhance market surveillance, enabling us to timely respond to the latest market developments.\n\nThroughout the year, despite macro-level challenges and rising credit risks, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient, with ample capital and liquidity. At the end of 2022, the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of local banks reached 20.1%, significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of major banks slightly increased to 162.3%, also far exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenges in the credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system slightly deteriorated, with the specific classification loan ratio rising to 1.38% by the end of 2022. However, this level remains robust and is lower than the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: Effective Regulation Ensures Operational Stability\n\nThe pandemic, which has lasted for three years, has intensified challenges from various fronts, such as escalating geopolitical tensions and major central banks tightening monetary policies. However, thanks to sound risk management practices and an effective regulatory framework developed over the years, Hong Kong's banking system has maintained robustness and continues to play a vital role in supporting the economy.\n\nOne of the main regulatory challenges faced over the past year has been ensuring that banks continue to provide necessary support to customers while maintaining robust credit risk management, amid ongoing economic uncertainties following the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extension of the \"pre-approved interest-only\" program has been further prolonged, with the addition of a voluntary partial principal repayment option, allowing borrowers to choose to start repaying part of the principal, thereby helping customers prepare for resuming normal repayment schedules.\n\nIn response to increased market volatility caused by major economies significantly tightening monetary policies, another key regulatory initiative of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in 2022 was to strengthen the monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk exposure. We thoroughly assessed the potential impacts of the simultaneous tightening of monetary policies by various economies on banks, and introduced new scenarios into stress tests to evaluate banks' resilience to prolonged liquidity stress.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to take forward-looking measures to promote effective risk management across multiple areas. In terms of operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities, we provide guidance to help banks develop comprehensive and holistic operational frameworks to achieve resilient operations, and offer detailed regulatory guidance on specific operational areas, such as providing guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the widespread adoption of cloud technology. Additionally, in response to the accelerated development of digitalization, we have also strengthened efforts to combat phishing scams and advanced work on consumer and investor protection.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the HKMA's call for providing basic banking services, with some establishing new branches and self-service banking facilities in large public housing estates in new development areas. Affected by pandemic-related travel restrictions, many Hong Kong residents were unable to use their mainland bank accounts. Recognizing this, the HKMA closely collaborated with relevant parties to help restart approximately 500,000 mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to do so without needing to personally visit mainland China.\n\nAnother strategically important area for the sustained development of the banking industry is enhancing professional capabilities. The demand for specialized talent remains substantial as the industry expands. Building on its talent development strategy — \"Connecting Talent with the Future\" — the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced multiple initiatives over the past year to help the banking sector attract, nurture, and retain talent. These measures focus on enhancing and retraining the skills of existing professionals, as well as cultivating the younger generation to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n#International Financial Center: Hong Kong Returns to the International Stage!\n\nThe pandemic-related travel restrictions that had been in place for a long time were gradually lifted in 2022, and we made multifaceted efforts to bring Hong Kong back onto the global stage. The \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" held in November attracted over 200 international and regional representatives from global financial institutions, drawing attention and enthusiastic responses from around the world. Despite the summit's dates coinciding with the first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years, the summit was still highly successful, sending a strong message to the world that Hong Kong has fully resumed normal operations and is demonstrating unprecedented vitality and energy. We are pleased to see the positive ripple effect generated by the summit, with many global financial institutions and international organizations currently or planning to hold various events in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to attracting visitors from around the world to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues and I at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have realized the importance of face-to-face communication and connections. Therefore, we have made every effort to personally represent Hong Kong at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and leverage overseas visits to meet with the executive management of global financial institutions, deepening their understanding of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the various opportunities Hong Kong offers under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center, we continue to push the boundaries of the market in strategic areas such as fintech, opportunities in the mainland, and green and sustainable finance. We are also further enhancing Hong Kong's financial infrastructure to provide top-tier services and attract more enterprises to establish themselves in Hong Kong. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the \"2022 Sustainability Report.\"\n\n# FinTech\n\nFollowing the announcement of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we made significant progress across all five areas in 2022.\n\nWe have achieved satisfactory outcomes in our efforts to comprehensively promote the digitalization of banking. According to the results of the fintech application assessment, the Hong Kong banking industry has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, with the range of technology categories used continuously expanding. Our gradual promotion and support of digitalization efforts since 2017 have received a positive response from banks and have continued to yield results, with the outcomes being encouraging. We will continue to closely collaborate with the industry, based on the assessment results, to further promote the application of fintech in specific banking business areas and to advance the development of individual technology categories.\n\nThis year, our work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) has entered an important new phase. The \"Multilateral Central Bank Digital Currency Cross-Border Network\" (mBridge) project has entered its pilot phase, becoming one of the first CBDC initiatives globally to enable real settlement for cross-border corporate transactions. In the retail sector, technical testing for cross-border use of digital RMB has entered its second phase, primarily testing the use of the \"TransferFast\" system to top up digital RMB wallets. Regarding digital Hong Kong dollars, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for the potential future issuance of digital Hong Kong dollars, and launch the second track pilot program, inviting industry stakeholders to deeply explore feasible application scenarios for digital Hong Kong dollars.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of fintech. The \"Commercial Data Exchange,\" launched in October last year, represents a significant step forward in enhancing Hong Kong's data infrastructure. As a shared data infrastructure based on data owner authorization, the \"Commercial Data Exchange\" enables financial institutions to access business data, making it easier for companies, particularly SMEs, to obtain financing. By the end of 2022, the \"Commercial Data Exchange\" had facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, totaling over HKD 1.9 billion.\n\nFinally, while embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also recognize the necessity to monitor and address potential risks arising from related developments. We are closely monitoring the evolution of the virtual asset sector and participating in international discussions on relevant regulatory matters. Taking into account the opinions gathered from public consultations and relevant international standards, we will adopt the principle of \"same risk, same regulation\" (1) to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins and define the scope of their regulation. In the future, our regulatory focus will initially target stablecoins that claim to be pegged to the value of one or more fiat currencies, as such stablecoins may pose higher and more pressing potential risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that with appropriate regulations in place, the industry can more safely and securely explore the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking industry are actively preparing to face this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully unlock the potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\n#MainlandOpportunities\n"}

The labor market initially deteriorated but gradually improved afterward, while inflation remained moderate. Benefiting from the full resumption of travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from its low base in 2023.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system remained robust in 2022, with capital and liquidity conditions remaining ample and asset quality continuing to be at a healthy level.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nWith the U.S. tightening its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar has weakened, leading to the weak-side exchange guarantee being triggered multiple times this year. However, the Hong Kong foreign exchange and monetary markets have continued to operate in an orderly and smooth manner, repeatedly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Reserve Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. The foreign exchange fund reported an overall investment return of -4.5%, which, compared to the performance of most diversified asset funds in the market, represented a relatively moderate loss.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also continuing to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. Meanwhile, the Long-term Growth Portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since the commencement of investments in 2009.\n\n# Banking System Stability\n\nIn response to expanding volatility in financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has strengthened its oversight of banks' credit and market risk management, and is working closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, in order to address the persistent increase in cyber threats and the accelerated digital transformation of the banking sector.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has further introduced consumer protection measures concerning \"buy now, pay later\" products and new property mortgage payment arrangements. Additionally, the HKMA has collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a virtual asset regulatory framework, issued guidelines on the distribution of investment products, and launched a new trust business regulatory regime. The \"Credit Information Platform\" under the \"Multiple Credit Information Service Providers\" model was also launched this year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with banks to enhance Hong Kong's anti-money laundering (AML) ecosystem, strengthen measures to combat scams, and further promote the application of data and technology through its \"AML Compliance Tech Lab\" series, while accelerating the HKMA's adoption of regulatory technology in its AML efforts.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards related to capital adequacy and disclosure requirements locally. The Authority has also collaborated with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance employees' skills for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources in all locally systemically important banks, marking a significant milestone in the development of the resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit achieved success, consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and generating a positive ripple effect.\n\nThe currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority was optimized during the year, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also collaborated with other regulators and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of \"Swap Connect\" and to introduce a dual-trading-platform market maker mechanism to support the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong.

{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","en":"# 2023 Work Priorities and Future Outlook\n\nAlthough the Hong Kong economy showed signs of recovery in early 2023, the external environment remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties. Recently, the banking sectors in the United States and Europe have faced pressure, with individual U.S. banks closing in March 2023, creating ripple effects across global financial markets. The tightening of monetary policies by major central banks could likely lead to a slowdown or even a recession in global economic growth in 2023. Meanwhile, ongoing geopolitical tensions and the persistent threat of deglobalization may continue to hinder global trade and cause periodic volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's financial system, supported by its robust resilience and ample buffers built up over the years, is well-equipped to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) places great emphasis on safeguarding currency and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to swiftly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. In a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to prudently manage the Exchange Fund's investments while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and ensuring high liquidity.\n\n# The financial system remains stable and sound.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains constrained by significant uncertainties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will closely monitor the latest developments, heighten vigilance, and guard against various potential risks to maintain a stable and sound financial system. This is a prerequisite for the continued provision of critical financial services and, therefore, the lifeline for maintaining the normal operation of Hong Kong's economy.\n\n# Stay Vigilant to Potential Risks\n\nIn 2023, uncertainty surrounding the future path of U.S. interest rates, along with pressures emerging in the banking systems of advanced economies, could pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Furthermore, ongoing geopolitical risks may continue to weigh on global trade and could lead to periodic volatility in global financial markets. However, Hong Kong's financial system, with its resilience and buffers built up over the years, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also has the capability, resources, and determination to maintain Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in both local and external environments, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems. The Authority will also study matters that affect Hong Kong's economy and assess the potential risks associated with these matters.\n\n# Maintain the stability of the banking system\n\nIn light of the escalating geopolitical tensions and major central banks significantly raising interest rates to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector in 2023 is still expected to be challenging. On the other hand, rapid technological development and digitalization present both threats and opportunities for the banking industry. Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to ensuring banks have sufficient capacity to withstand shocks through continuous regulatory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimize its banking regulatory framework and policies by referring to international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-Based Regulatory Priorities\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions, focusing on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as the management of borrowers with weaker financial conditions. The Authority will also enhance its supervisory system and take proactive measures to ensure the overall credit risk level in the banking system remains manageable.\n\nOn the other hand, the HKMA will continue to monitor the operating environment of businesses and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the eventual exit from the \"pre-approved interest-only\" loan program, while simultaneously ensuring that customers facing temporary difficulties continue to receive adequate credit support.\n\nIn addition, in response to the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will strengthen its oversight of authorized institutions' liquidity and market risk management in 2023.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their business operations, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to enhancing the operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities of the banking sector. Following the issuance of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the \"Regulatory Policy Manual\" in May, the HKMA will maintain close communication with the industry to review the progress of authorized institutions in establishing operational resilience frameworks. At the same time, the HKMA will enhance the banking sector's cybersecurity capabilities by following up on issues identified in the \"Cybersecurity Assessment Framework 2.0\" and examining the progress of authorized institutions in implementing robust triple data backup measures.\n\nAs the pace of digitization accelerates, the HKMA's other regulatory priorities include strengthening the regulation of risk management related to banks' third-party service providers, as well as enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking industry.\n\n#CombatMoneyLaunderingAndTerroristFinancing\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will focus on updating regulatory information, enhancing collaboration among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing ecosystem to address money laundering and terrorism financing risks, and further promoting the development of AML regulatory technology and compliance technology. The HKMA's \"Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing\" will also be revised, providing specific guidance on implementing proportionate measures based on risk for \"politically exposed persons,\" thereby facilitating the industry's effective and risk-based implementation of key legislative amendments. At the same time, the HKMA will expand the scope of existing public-private partnerships to strengthen information sharing and support the launch of an inter-bank information sharing platform to accelerate the detection of suspicious accounts, prevent account abuse, and enhance protection for victims of scams and assistance in recovering losses. The HKMA will also further focus on promoting the adoption of compliance technology, including data analytics, through the \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Technology Laboratory\" and other AML compliance technology initiatives, and strive to develop macro-level analytical capabilities to support its data-driven AML regulatory work. Through the implementation of these measures, the HKMA will be able to respond more swiftly to systemic money laundering risks such as puppet account networks and flexibly address evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Services\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will enhance on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of authorized institutions regarding their conduct in wealth management, as well as the sale of securities, Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), and other investment and insurance products. The key focus areas in 2023 will include the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" program, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. Throughout the process, the HKMA will take into account the latest market developments and revisions to international standards.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will also maintain close communication with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, and provide guidance as needed to authorized institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) products, which will also include guidance on providing investment services related to virtual assets. In this regard, to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the HKMA will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulators to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets.\n\nWith the smooth launch of the Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will coordinate with the industry and relevant regulatory bodies to optimize the program. In addition, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales procedures for investment products (including procedures applicable to sophisticated investors), and will begin regulating the trust businesses of authorized institutions in accordance with the new unit and new operational guidelines in the relevant Regulatory Policy Manual.\n\n# Supervise Financial Market Infrastructure\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) aims to promote the safety and efficiency of financial market infrastructures under its supervision in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Payment Ordinance), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (Infrastructure Principles), and the guidelines issued by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee. The HKMA will assess various infrastructures in line with the latest international standards as needed, participate in the oversight and evaluation programs conducted by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) regarding the implementation of the Infrastructure Principles, engage in the work of international standard-setting organizations, and enhance its own oversight requirements by referencing international practices or adapting to market and technological developments. Additionally, the HKMA will cooperate with relevant authorities as necessary to further strengthen collaborative oversight arrangements.\n\n# Formulate Policies\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to strengthen and optimize the banking regulatory framework and policies in accordance with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementing Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n#CapitalStandard\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further optimize its capital framework by implementing the standards issued recently by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, including:  \n- The revised capital standards set out in the Basel III: Finalising Post-Crisis Reforms (December 2017), the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk (January 2019, revised in February 2019), and the Targeted amendments to the Risk Framework for Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk (July 2020). These revised capital standards, collectively referred to as the Basel III Final Reforms, outline new regulatory approaches for credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, and introduce floor requirements as well as an optimized leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultations in 2022, the HKMA plans to conduct a statutory consultation on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (Capital Rules) in 2023 to implement the aforementioned requirements and the neutral countercyclical capital buffer. The proposed amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny in the same year and will not take effect earlier than January 1, 2024, as the minimum requirement.  \n- The Prudential Treatment of Risks from Crypto-Assets (December 2022). The HKMA plans to implement these standards locally by January 1, 2025, in line with the Basel Committee's timetable, and intends to consult the industry on the related proposals in 2023.\n\n# Risk Tolerance\n\nIn March 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) consulted the industry on proposed amendments to the Banking (Risk Limitation) Rules. These proposed amendments were primarily introduced in response to the HKMA's implementation of revised capital standards under the Basel III final reform package. The consultation paper also included other corresponding revisions regarding the handling of concentrated risks from official entities under the Capital Rules. The target implementation date for the revised rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk component under the revised Capital Rules related to the Basel III final reform package (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity Standards\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to consult the industry in 2023 on proposed amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules through the 2023 Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules (the \"2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules\"). These amendments are made in response to the proposed amendments to the Capital Rules during the same period. Therefore, the target implementation date for the 2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules will align with the implementation date of the credit risk component in the revised Capital Rules under the Basel III Final Reform Package (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to the revised capital standards under the final reform package of Basel III are primarily outlined in two documents issued by the Basel Committee: \"Third Pillar 1 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework,\" released in December 2018, and \"Revised Market Risk Disclosure Requirements,\" issued in November 2021. In addition, the Basel Committee issued \"Revised Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements\" in June 2019, aiming to address concerns regarding potential \"window dressing\" (i.e., banks reducing certain transaction volumes before or after the reporting date to artificially inflate reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratios). To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also preparing corresponding amendments to the \"Banking (Disclosure) Rules\" (the \"Disclosure Rules\"), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and forms, while seeking industry feedback throughout the process. It is expected that the amendments to the Disclosure Rules will be submitted to the Legislative Council for pre-legislative scrutiny together with the amendments to the Capital Rules in 2023.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n- 建立了一套清晰且具備高問責性的機構管治架構；\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；及\n- 奉行具透明度及保持開放的政策，與各持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。尤其，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能」一章（第157至162頁）。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 監控措施\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的內部及外部監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和商討各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並由該會定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","en":"# Institutional Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong's central banking institution, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority fully understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and upholding public trust and confidence in the Authority's statutory duties. Therefore, it has consistently strived to uphold high standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo demonstrate its commitment to good institutional governance, the HKMA:  \n- Established a clear and highly accountable institutional governance framework;  \n- Implemented comprehensive and robust monitoring measures to manage risks and ensure that the behavior and daily operations of all staff comply with specified standards; and  \n- Upheld transparent and open policies, maintaining close communication with all stakeholders.\n\n# HKMA and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is part of the structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG), but it can appoint staff under terms of employment different from those of civil servants in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA's Chief Executive and its staff are considered public officials. The HKMA's day-to-day operations are highly autonomous within the legal powers granted to or delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong's monetary policy objectives and currency system. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, addressed to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Financial Secretary specified that currency stability should be maintained through the Exchange Fund system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is autonomously responsible for achieving monetary policy objectives, including deciding on relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's currency system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the Financial Controller's responsibilities include:  \n- Promoting the overall stability and efficient operation of the banking system;  \n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop debt markets;  \n- Handling matters related to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;  \n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, settlement, and clearing systems, and where appropriate, operating such systems; and  \n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to enhance confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Controller must act under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary and be responsible to the Financial Secretary regarding the management and investment of the Foreign Exchange Fund.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nIn terms of the methods used in daily operations and the implementation of government policy objectives, the HKMA has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy, coupled with strong accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking system, effectively managing official reserves, developing and overseeing a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and driving Hong Kong's economic development.\n\nTo effectively perform its duties, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) must gain the trust of the public. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach in explaining its policies and operations to the public, and makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within its mandate. In particular, the HKMA timely clarifies false information and rumors regarding its policies through both traditional and social media channels.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is appointed by the Financial Secretary and is therefore accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Additionally, as the HKMA's authority is established by laws enacted by the Legislative Council, it is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also recognizes its broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor matters of public concern. In carrying out its daily operations and maintaining extensive engagement with society, the HKMA adheres to a policy of striving to enhance transparency and maintain openness. This policy has two main objectives:  \n- To the greatest extent possible, ensuring that the financial sector and the public are fully informed about the HKMA's work, while taking into account legal restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive information, commercial secrets, and confidential data; and  \n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving international best standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive contact with the media, the HKMA publishes a variety of bilingual journals and special publications. The HKMA's bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, and also hosts a large volume of publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials issued by the HKMA. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA's office houses an information center, divided into a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week for visits and use. Details regarding the HKMA's work in communication and engagement with the public can be found in the chapter \"Functions of the Institution\" (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has progressively increased the frequency of disclosing information regarding the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board, with the content becoming increasingly detailed. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) program for central banks in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA's website has featured banking supervision policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Governor has committed to providing three annual briefings to the Legislative Council's Financial Affairs Committee on the HKMA's operations and policies, and to address related inquiries. In addition, HKMA representatives regularly attend meetings of the Legislative Council's Committees and Subcommittees to elaborate on and discuss specific issues, as well as to support legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Surveillance measures\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure the maintenance of high standards of employee conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these monitoring mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees' ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that all employees at all levels meet the specified standards in their conduct.\n\n# Internal Monitoring\n\n# Operation Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for assessing the risks in their work processes and developing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the stable daily operations of the HKMA.\n\n# Institutional Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, is one of the cornerstones of the institutional risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, assesses whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority independently assesses whether the governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures of different departments are sufficient and effective, and provides recommendations for improvement.\n\n# External Audit\n\nUnder Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. The Audit Commission does not charge any fees for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Annual Report.\n"}

The labor market deteriorated for a period before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also faced pressure. Benefiting from the full resumption of travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from its low point in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real Economic Activities\n\nHong Kong's economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, dragged down by various adverse local and external factors (Table 1 and Figure 1). Locally, private consumption plummeted in the first quarter due to the outbreak of Hong Kong's fifth wave of the novel coronavirus. Private consumption then recorded a quarterly increase later, benefiting from the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and the stimulus provided by the government's consumption voucher program. Under weak business sentiment and tightening financial conditions, overall investment expenditure fell significantly compared to 2021. Externally, Hong Kong's goods exports declined as external demand weakened and cross-border land freight between Hong Kong and mainland China was disrupted. Service exports remained largely weak, partly reflecting the subdued tourism activities in Hong Kong, but the situation improved slightly in the fourth quarter after the government lifted the mandatory quarantine requirement for arrivals in late September.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of Components to Real Local GDP Growth  \nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Local GDP Growth by Expenditure Items (Quarter-over-Quarter)\nNote: The quarterly change in seasonally adjusted total local fixed capital formation is not available.\nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation pressures rose slightly in 2022 but remained moderate. Specifically, the annual core inflation rate gradually increased to a moderate level of 2% by December, partially offset by moderate local cost pressures, particularly relatively soft housing rents (Figure 2). Additionally, against a backdrop of weak economic activity, subdued nominal wage growth and commercial property rents also helped contain inflation. For the full year of 2022, the core and overall inflation rates stood at 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labor Market\n\nThe labor market situation deteriorated sharply at the beginning of 2022 but then continued to improve. After the unemployment rate peaked at 5.4% in April, it significantly declined to 3.5% by December (Figure 3), with unemployment rates declining across most industries. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies rebounded, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, although total employment remains below pre-pandemic levels. Annual growth rates of nominal wages and labor income also slightly accelerated. On the other hand, the labor force decreased by 1.5% compared to the same period last year, partly due to a slight decline in the labor force participation rate.\n\nFigure 2 Core Consumer Price Inflation  \nSource: Government Statistics Department and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) staff estimates.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions Source: Government Statistics Department\n\n#StockMarket\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced significant volatility in 2022. Building on the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on October 31, 2022—the lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The market's significant adjustment was initially triggered by heightened concerns over the local COVID-19 situation, U.S. interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Subsequently, the adjustment widened further due to tightening global financial conditions and deteriorating economic outlooks caused by the mainland's COVID-19 situation. The stock market regained some upward momentum in the final two months of the year, partly supported by mainland China's optimized pandemic prevention and control measures. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,781 points by year-end, marking a significant 15.5% decline compared to the end of 2021, representing a third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nUnder tightening financial conditions and weak economic activity, the residential property market also faced pressure. Housing prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), while transaction volume dropped sharply by 39% to 45,050 deals, a record low on record. Despite the decline in housing prices, affordability remained tight. The actual mortgage interest rate rose during the year from approximately 1.6% to between 3.375% and 3.625%, increasing the mortgage payment burden for homebuyers. The non-residential property market also softened further. With high vacancy rates, prices declined, and rents remained weak.\n\nFigure 4 Asset Prices  \nSource: Hong Kong Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nBenefiting from the full resumption of travel between the mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economic growth is expected to recover from its low level in 2023. Although the slowdown in growth forecasts for advanced economies will continue to hinder Hong Kong's goods exports, the recovery of the mainland economy and the removal of cross-border land freight restrictions should provide support for Hong Kong's economy. The full resumption of travel between the mainland and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit Hong Kong's inbound tourism and other service exports, while boosting the local business climate and capital expenditure. Private consumption is also expected to improve further as the labor market strengthens. The government projects that the real local GDP for the entire year of 2023 will grow significantly, between 3.5% and 5.5%. However, Hong Kong's economic growth outlook remains affected by numerous risks and uncertainties, largely depending on the trajectory of the Federal Reserve's policy interest rates, global growth prospects, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the pace of recovery in local inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and Labor Market\n\nLooking ahead, local inflation is expected to rise slightly, but it should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. Although external prices are likely to remain high, the upward momentum of external prices may further weaken due to weaker economic activity in some major economies and easing upward pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, local cost pressures may rise slightly as the local economy recovers and the labor market improves, but relatively soft housing rents should continue to offset their impact to some extent. The government forecasts the overall and core inflation rates for the full year of 2023 to be 2.9% and 2.5%, respectively. On the other hand, labor market conditions are expected to further improve as local economic activity returns to normal.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nThe Hong Kong banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of the year, escalating geopolitical tensions, and significant interest rate hikes by major global central banks in response to rising inflation. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong banks managed effectively, maintaining ample capital and liquidity positions. Credit risk within the banking system increased during the year, but overall asset quality remained at a healthy level. Meanwhile, rising interest rates contributed to higher net interest income for banks, although this positive effect was partially offset by increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts and a decline in fees and commission income. Overall, retail banking profits improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset Quality\n\nThe specific classification loan ratio in the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the delinquent and restructured loan ratio increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). The specific classification loan ratio for related loans in mainland China stood at 2.21% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The increase in the specific classification loan ratio was mainly due to the downgrading of loan ratings for some mainland Chinese real estate developers. Nevertheless, banks maintained adequate provisions, with the credit provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of credit provisions to specific classification loan ratios) remaining around 80% as of the end of 2022. When the collateral's liquidation value is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the credit provision coverage ratio is approximately 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23%, respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5 Asset Quality of the Banking System  \nNote: The numbers cover the Hong Kong Office, overseas branches, and overseas major subsidiaries.  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency Rates of Residential Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nThe banking sector continued to record profits in 2022. Retail banks' overall pre-tax operating profit increased by 19.0% during the year (Figure 7). The profit improvement was driven by higher net interest income (+34%) and increased revenue from foreign exchange and derivatives (+72%), although some of the growth was offset by higher provisions for bad debts (+151%) and a decline in expenses and commission income (-19%). In a rising interest rate environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility during the year also contributed to higher income from foreign exchange and derivatives businesses. The increase in provisions for bad debts was due to the need to set aside special reserves for newly classified loans, while weak financial market performance led to a decline in expenses and commission income. The cost-to-income ratio for retail banks fell from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banks Source: HKMA\n\nFigure 8: Retail Banking Net Interest Margin. Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Balance Sheet Trend\n\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 2.5% in 2022. The increase in assets was due to a rise in the mark-to-market valuation of foreign exchange and derivative holdings. Facing external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened during the year. Compared to a 3.8% increase in 2021, total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022. This included a 10.2% decline in loans used outside Hong Kong, a 13.5% decrease in trade financing, and a modest 0.9% increase in loans used within Hong Kong. Mainland China-related loans, which had grown by 3.7% in 2021, decreased by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nOn the liability side of the balance sheet, banking system deposits continued to record moderate growth. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2021. Due to a decrease in total loans and an increase in total deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio declined slightly from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Level\n\nThe bank's capital position remained ample in 2022. The comprehensive capital ratio of locally registered authorized institutions stood at 20.1% at the end of 2022, compared to 20.2% in the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both ratios were significantly higher than the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 11 Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Local Registered Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 12 Aggregate Leverage Ratio of Local Registered Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\n# Liquidity Status\n\nThe liquidity situation in the banking system has remained robust, serving as a crucial pillar amid heightened uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The quarterly average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the quarterly average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions was 63.2% (Figure 13). The primary source of funds for the banking system remains customer deposits. As of the end of 2022, the net stable funding ratio for Category 1 institutions and the core funding ratio for Category 2A institutions were 137.7% and 155.7%, respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios are significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n\nFigure 14: Capital Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions  \nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)\n"}

Driven by increased stock market turnover in Hong Kong and year-end seasonal fund demand, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong's interbank interest rates generally followed the trend of US interbank interest rates. Due to the US's continued interest rate hikes, Hong Kong's interbank interest rates gradually rose throughout 2022. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar's foreign exchange and money markets remained stable, with smooth and orderly transactions. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience against external shocks.\n\n# Goal\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is to maintain currency stability, which entails ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar. This monetary system mainly adopts the Exchange Fund system, which stipulates that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; if the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must also be correspondingly increased or decreased to fully align with the changes in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) includes:  \n- Promissory notes (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks);  \n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins;  \n- The total balance of settlement accounts held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (i.e., the total reserve); and  \n- Foreign exchange fund bills and bonds issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange rate guarantee. When the strong (or weak) exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy U.S. dollars at a rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar), thereby increasing (or decreasing) the total surplus, causing the Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the 7.75 to 7.85 exchange rate range.\n\n# 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange Rate Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar weakened in early 2022, driven by adjustments in the local stock market, market expectations of further US interest rate hikes, and carry trade activities arising from the negative interest rate differential between Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Hong Kong dollar remained close to the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level in subsequent months. The weak-side exchange rate guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November. The Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November, driven by increased stock market turnover and year-end seasonal funding demand (Figure 1). Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the sustained demand from banks for foreign exchange fund notes, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued an additional HKD 40 billion worth of foreign exchange fund notes at the beginning of 2022. Additionally, between May and November 2022, the HKMA purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion at the weak-side exchange rate guarantee level under the design of the linked exchange rate system (linked system) in response to banks' requests. The total reserves decreased from HKD 377.5 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 96.3 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of foreign exchange fund notes and the activation of the weak-side exchange rate guarantee. Meanwhile, the total amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds increased slightly from HKD 1,148.8 billion to HKD 1,200.4 billion during the year. As a result, the combined total of reserves and outstanding foreign exchange fund notes and bonds decreased from HKD 15,263 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 12,967 billion at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remains fully supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1 2022 Market Exchange Rate\n\nFigure 2: 2022 Year-End Balance (Prior to Conducting Discount Window Activities) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# currency market\n\nUnder the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally followed the trend of U.S. dollar interbank offered rates. Due to the U.S. continuing to raise interest rates in 2022, Hong Kong interbank offered rates gradually increased (Figure 3). For the year, the overnight, one-month, and three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, respectively, reaching 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99% by year-end.\n\nIn response to the increase in the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range, the base rate was raised seven times, accumulating a total of 4.25 percentage points (or 425 basis points), rising from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). At the retail level, following the U.S. increase in policy rates, several banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, by an additional 25 basis points in early November, and by another 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the upper limit for new mortgage rates based on the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) during the year. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to operate normally. Discount window lending increased from HKD 6.8 billion in 2021 to HKD 8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for 2022\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a crucial pillar of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating a strong capacity to withstand challenges. Despite the fluctuating global financial conditions in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner, reflecting the system's robustness and effectiveness. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System. The International Monetary Fund reiterated in its 2022 External Sector Report that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the normal functioning of the linked exchange rate regime. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital adequacy well above international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience against shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, while maintaining regulatory oversight of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's accounts, since October 1998, certain assets of the Exchange Fund have been designated to support the currency base. The support ratio (the ratio of supporting assets to the currency base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching either the upper or lower limits. The ratio stood at 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund's assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund's substantial financial resources, combined with Hong Kong's robust banking system, provide a strong backing for the territory's monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Changes in the Support Ratio for 2022\n\n# Monetary Policy Committee\n\nThe Currency Board under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues related to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. In 2022, the topics discussed by the Currency Board included the property market situation in mainland China, the role of non-banking institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. The meeting minutes of the Currency Board and the Currency Board System Operation Reports submitted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to it are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Paper Money and Coins\n\n# Hong Kong Banknotes\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to hold seminars to educate bank tellers, retail cashiers, and students about the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes. In 2022, the HKMA conducted 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Plan\n\nThe coin collection program continues to be popular among citizens. Details of the program are included in the chapter titled \"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Sustainable Development\" in The 2022 Sustainable Development Report.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds Program continued to operate smoothly. To meet the sustained demand from banks for Exchange Fund Notes and taking into account market conditions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an additional HKD 400 billion in Exchange Fund Notes during the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the total remaining balance. As of the end of 2022, the nominal value of outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds amounted to approximately HKD 1,207.5 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Currency Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary and Financial Research Centre (Research Centre) has completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and held 16 seminars\/webinars, covering strategically significant monetary and financial research topics relevant to Hong Kong and the region. The Research Centre has further arranged to release its findings through a new open-access e-journal, ensuring a broader audience can access the information. In addition, the Research Centre has launched a new publication series titled \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest\" on its website, summarizing the Centre's recent research findings for the public in high-level, non-technical summaries.\n\nIn addition to its research findings, the research center also organized two international conferences and three online expert seminars to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial affairs.\n\nOn April 12, a webinar titled \"Latest Macroeconomic Developments, the Federal Reserve's Tightening Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore RMB Market\" was jointly organized with the School of Finance. The event featured guest speakers Mr. Patrick Ho, former Governor of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Professor Huang Yiping, Professor and Jingguang Economics Chair at the National Development Institute, Peking University. The webinar was live-streamed on multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers in real-time.\n\nAn online seminar titled \"Transformation and Policy Choices in China's Real Estate Industry\" was held on June 24th. The event featured Ms. Qin Hong, a Senior Researcher at Renmin University and former Director of the Policy Research Center under the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as a keynote speaker, and was hosted by Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Economic Research in Asia at UBS and Chief China Economist. The seminar attracted nearly 1.13 million online live viewers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and other regions worldwide.\n\nOn August 25, an online workshop titled \"Spillover Effects of Monetary Policy\" was co-hosted with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. Over 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial institutions, and academic circles around the world participated online.\n\nAs an additional event outside the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit, the Financial College co-hosted an online seminar titled \"Inflation After COVID-19: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" on November 2nd. The seminar featured analysis by Dr. Chris Riddell, founder and chief economist of the Monetary Observer and former chief economist at Invesco. Nearly 200 economists participated in the seminar online.\n\nThe 12th Annual China Economic International Conference was held on November 23, with the theme \"A New Phase in China's Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yimeng, Deputy Chairman of the China International Center for Economic Exchange and Director of the Academic Committee, delivered a keynote speech at the conference on China's short-term and long-term economic outlook.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","en":"# Banking System Stability\n\nDespite uncertainties and challenges in the macro environment and abnormal fluctuations in financial markets, Hong Kong's banking system remained resilient in 2022. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also strengthened its supervision of credit and market risk management at authorized institutions. Furthermore, in light of the continued increase in cyber threats and the accelerated digital transformation of the banking sector, the HKMA closely collaborated with authorized institutions to enhance their operational resilience and cyber defense capabilities.\n\nIn terms of integrity regulation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has enhanced consumer protection for \"buy now, pay later\" products and introduced an additional payment arrangement for property transfer transactions. The HKMA has also collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and introduce a new regulatory regime for trust business. This year, the credit information platform under the \"multiple credit information service providers\" model for personal credit data was launched, along with a new mandatory background check program to address the \"rolling bad apples\" phenomenon. Additionally, in response to travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in implementing convenient measures to help customers restart their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest risk assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has collaborated with banks through public-private partnerships (including the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force) to strengthen Hong Kong's ecosystem for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as enhance efforts to address fraud cases. Additionally, the HKMA has partnered with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage risks and instabilities arising from an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA has also further promoted the industry's use of data and technology through its \"Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Tech Lab\" series, while simultaneously accelerating the adoption of regulatory technology (RegTech) in its anti-money laundering efforts. In international affairs, the HKMA actively participates in the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nIn 2022, local authorities made significant progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure standards. Additionally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively enhanced the industry's soft power by collaborating with the banking sector to establish a sustainable talent pool and improve the skills of existing professionals. Throughout the year, the HKMA worked closely with the banking industry to refine and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe HKMA continues to advance its work at both local and international levels to ensure Hong Kong has a credible resolution mechanism. Specific initiatives include developing new resolution standards, conducting regional crisis simulation exercises, and establishing a new layer of loss-absorption capacity resources in all systemically important local banks, marking a milestone for the HKMA in enhancing the feasibility of resolution.\n\n# Goal\n\nOne of the HKMA's overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal relies on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing the critical financial services required by Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even through disorderly closures in extreme cases. As a regulatory authority, the Financial Secretary plays a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring that banks have the capacity to withstand shocks and recover from crises to resume normal operations, ultimately helping to prevent closures. The Financial Secretary is responsible for prudential regulation of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, banks with restricted licenses, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong's prudential regulatory system is not designed to ensure \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strives to ensure that in the event an authorized institution becomes unsustainable, its insolvency can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a financial institution resolution framework, under which the HKMA serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (as well as other types of institutions). To implement Hong Kong's resolution framework, it is necessary to establish resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to eliminate obstacles to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions, and build the HKMA's operational capacity to resolve insolvent authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts internationally consistent and coordinated approaches.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and supervising certain financial market infrastructures. The HKMA's oversight of financial market infrastructures aims to promote the overall safety and efficiency of such infrastructures, control systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures helps safeguard Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, preventing potential impacts on its stability that could arise from disruptions in the operation of these infrastructures.\n\n# 2022 Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority authorized six overseas trading platforms to become currency brokers. In addition, five licensed banks and one bank with a restricted license had their authorization revoked.\n\nFor more information on authorized institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices and Tables D to F, which are located on pages 283 to 286 and pages 292 to 295, respectively.\n\n# Supervision Work Overview\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 183 non-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas, including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and the adoption of fintech. To continue enhancing the risk governance standards of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of directors of authorized institutions, and conducted 38 trilateral meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducts regular on-site inspections of the various business operations of authorized institutions. From a prudential regulatory perspective, credit risk management is one of the key areas of focus. At the same time, given the increasing use of technology by banks, operational and technology risk management have become another key regulatory focus. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the HKMA has also carried out a round of thematic reviews focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct regulation, the HKMA conducts on-site inspections of authorized institutions' securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses, complemented by thematic assessments to examine categories assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Supervisory Work\n\n# Credit Risk\n\n# Credit Growth and Asset Quality\n\nThe total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 shows the growth of various types of loans and advances. In 2022, the total related loans in Mainland China also decreased by 4.4% to HKD 4.522 trillion (Table 3).\n\nThe banking system faced various challenges and shocks throughout the year, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks, and deteriorating financial conditions of some mainland real estate developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated during the year but remained at a healthy level. The non-performing loan ratio in the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. The non-performing loan ratio for Mainland-related loans rose to 2.21% from 0.89% a year earlier.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) enhanced both the breadth and depth of its risk monitoring and maintained close communication with authorized institutions to promptly assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of these institutions. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remains manageable. The results of the HKMA's debt stress tests indicate that the banking system continues to maintain adequate capital buffers, enabling it to withstand extreme stress scenarios.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a thematic assessment during the year to review the credit risk management practices of authorized institutions, with an emphasis on asset quality, risk exposure to more vulnerable industries, credit risk from branches outside Hong Kong, and secured loans provided to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nOn the other hand, in the challenging macroeconomic environment, an increasing number of companies are facing financial difficulties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages authorized institutions to address situations where companies encounter repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles outlined in the Hong Kong Corporate Financial Distress Handling Code, thus enabling individual authorized institutions to coordinate and cooperate from the perspective of the common interests of the relevant lending institutions.\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in the Mainland\n\n# Relieve customers' cash flow pressure\n\nTaking into account the impact of the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the complex and volatile outlook for both external and Hong Kong economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has, in conjunction with the \"SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in the Banking Sector,\" extended the \"pre-approved interest-only repayment\" scheme until the end of July 2023. In addition, the scheme has introduced and subsequently optimized certain principal repayment options to help customers prepare for resuming normal repayments.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, the bank had approved over 108,000 cases of corporate client loan deferrals and other support measures, involving amounts exceeding HKD 110 billion. In terms of personal clients, the bank also approved over 81,000 cases of residential mortgage interest-only payments (without principal repayment) and other personal emergency loans, involving amounts exceeding HKD 65 billion.\n\n# Real Estate Mortgage Loan\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced several rounds of countercyclical macroprudential regulatory measures, which have enhanced banks' risk management and the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system against a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average debt-to-income ratio for new mortgages has remained at a low level, standing at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nIn September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) reduced the assumed increase in mortgage interest rates for the mortgage loan stress test from 300 basis points to 200 basis points. This decision took into account the current interest rate environment, as well as the trend of mortgage interest rates relative to their historical long-term average. The HKMA believes this level is sufficient to ensure that risks in banks' mortgage businesses are properly managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio of Newly Issued Residential Mortgages\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nOver the past year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has introduced multiple measures to enhance the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures include the release in May of a new section titled \"Operational Resilience\" in the Regulatory Policy Manual, outlining the governance and control frameworks that the HKMA expects authorized institutions to maintain to ensure operational resilience, as well as holding two industry dialogues to enhance the industry's understanding of the new standards and facilitate knowledge sharing within the sector (Figure 1).\n\nThe HKMA also provides detailed regulatory guidelines on specific aspects of banking operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defense mechanisms against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nIn response to the ever-evolving cyber threats, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is promoting banks to adopt a robust triple data backup arrangement, monitoring the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defence Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and assessing banks' ability to respond to supply chain attacks, aiming to enhance the banking sector's cyber defence capabilities.\n\nIn response to the significant increase in risks posed by phishing scams and other online frauds, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Bankers Association (Banking Association) jointly launched a new large-scale promotional campaign in September with the theme \"Digital KEY, watch out! Think twice before clicking the LINK!\" to raise public awareness. In July, they also co-hosted a workshop with the Hong Kong Police Force to brief banks on the latest fraudulent tactics employed by criminals.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign themed \"Digital Keys: Stay Alert! Think Twice Before Clicking the Link!\"\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogue \"Journey Towards Operational Stability\"\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn response to increased market volatility caused by further tightening of monetary policies by major economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has enhanced its monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA is conducting reviews to assess whether authorized institutions have adequate liquidity risk management frameworks, with a focus on the diversification of funding sources and the systems and controls for group-wide liquidity risk management.

{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局在2022年多管齊下，在提升香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」舉辦成功，吸引來自約120間環球金融機構超過200位國際及區內領袖參加，不僅鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，更製造正面的漣漪效應。\n\n在鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐方面，多個範疇均取得理想進展，包括優化金管局與中國人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議，以及金管局的人民幣流動資金安排，確保有足夠人民幣流動性，協助進一步推進離岸人民幣產品及市場發展；與中國人民銀行和證券及期貨事務監察委員會聯合宣布開展「互換通」；與證券及期貨事務監察委員會和香港交易及結算所有限公司合作推出雙櫃台莊家機制，推動人民幣計價股票在香港交易；以及金管局推出多年期計劃，進一步優化金融市場基建及發展債務工具中央結算系統成為亞洲區主要的國際中央證券託管平台。受惠於充足的人民幣流動性，並憑藉世界級的市場基建及內地與香港之間各個互聯互通機制，香港已成為內地資金進入國際市場及國際投資者投資於快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n金管局在加強香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家認識香港穩健的金融體系及其帶來的前景。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推行「金融科技2025」策略，促進金融業界更廣泛採用金融科技全面鞏固香港的金融科技樞紐地位。快速支付系統「轉數快」繼續穩步增長，登記數目在3月份突破1,000萬個，每日平均交易量亦在9月份超越100萬宗。\n\n金管局繼續積極參與國際及區內的央行及監管組織，對維持金融穩定及促進市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n# 概覽\n\n金管局繼續主動提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。於11月，金管局舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，落實財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布的計劃。峰會為期3日，雲集國際金融業界翹楚，就如何在各項不確定因素下把握機遇分享各自獨到的觀點。是項活動獲得極大迴響，吸引超過200位來自約120個國際金融機構的重量級嘉賓參加，充分體現全球金融界對香港的支持。\n\n香港進一步鞏固其作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位，年內離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。香港在促進內地與國際金融市場之間的資金流方面發揮關鍵作用，香港與內地間的互聯互通機制被公認為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場及內地投資者配置離岸資產的首選渠道。在2022年，債券通「北向通」成交額佔境外投資者在中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。債券通「南向通」及「跨境理財通」自2021年開通以來一直運作暢順。金管局與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）聯合宣布開展「互換通」，把香港與內地的金融合作進一步擴展至衍生品市場，並強化了香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務樞紐及風險管理中心的地位。金管局與人民銀行之間現有的貨幣互換協議於7月優化，是加強香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的另一重要里程碑。\n\n為在香港提供更多元的人民幣計價產品，由金管局、證監會與香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）組成的工作小組完成擴大人民幣在港股市場交易中的使用的可行性研究。工作小組已展開籌備工作，包括推出雙櫃台莊家機制，以優化港幣及人民幣雙櫃台股票的交易機制。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增加香港作為首選基金管理中心的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。在推動香港債券市場創新，以及鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位方面，亦取得重大進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室繼續與各銀行部門聯手實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n- 促進合規科技應用及進行金融科技應用評估；\n- 推動批發層面央行數碼貨幣的工作，致力改善跨境支付；\n- 加深在香港發行零售層面央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」或e-HKD）的研究；\n- 推出「商業數據通」；\n- 加強人才培育；\n- 善用資源政策支持金融科技生態圈；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n金融基建的可靠及有效運作，是鞏固香港作為主要國際金融中心地位的關鍵。在2022年，處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算系統（RTGS系統）、債務工具中央結算系統(CMU)及香港交易資料儲存庫均達到100%2的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。債券通「北向通」及「南向通」的交收服務維持暢順。年底時存放在CMU系統的債券中，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為12,075億港元，其他債券的未償還總額增至相當於15,733億港元，是2013年以來最高水平。\n\n「轉數快」使用量在2022年繼續增長。截至2022年底共有1,148萬個登記，每日平均交易量較2021年上升40%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察6個指定零售支付系統，並監管17個持牌儲值支付工具（其中4個由持牌銀行發行）。年內為繼續協助政府順利實施消費券計劃，金管局協調及促進相關政府部門與就計劃獲委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的溝通及合作。\n\n金管局在2023年1月發布加密資產和穩定幣討論文件的總結，歸納就討論文件收集到的意見和金管局的回應。總結文件確認金管局將會以風險為本和靈活的方式監管穩定幣，並闡述預期的監管範圍、主要的監管要求及下一步的工作。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。自2018年起，金管局在東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)3轄下金融市場工作小組連任三屆主席。此外，金管局擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組與金融創新網絡的聯席主席，另又領導金融穩定理事會轄下監察金融基準過渡相關監管事項的進度及作出跟進的小組。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 國際金融領袖投資峰會\n\n「國際金融領袖投資峰會」於11月1日至3日舉行\n\n繼財政司司長在《2022至23年度財政預算案》宣布，金管局於11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期3日，反響熱烈，匯聚26位金融業界翹楚就應對經濟、金融、科技及地緣政治不穩定因素，以及如何把握當中的機遇分享獨到觀點和想法。峰會共有超過200位來自約120間全球金融機構的參加者，當中超過40間機構均由集團董事長或行政總裁親自出席。參與峰會的機構不乏位列全球最大的銀行、證券、資產管理、主權財富基金、私募股權與風險投資、對冲基金及保險公司等金融界別。\n\n峰會向全球發出明確訊息，表明香港已經一切復常；全球金融領袖可以親身感受香港獨有的韌性和活力並了解發展亞洲業務的過程中香港可以提供的機遇。\n\n# 香港作為進入內地的主要門戶及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐\n\n香港致力鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，包括增強離岸流動性、進一步加強與內地金融市場的聯通，以及提升金融市場基建。年內人民幣業務，包括銀行存款、貿易結算、支付及離岸債券發行，繼續錄得穩健增長。在增強流動性、產品開發及擴大互聯互通機制方面，取得令人鼓舞的進展及成績。2022年國際結算銀行三年一度的外匯及衍生工具市場成交額調查結果，再次確認香港作為人民幣外匯中心的領先地位。\n\n債券通「北向通」繼續是國際投資者透過香港的市場基建及金融服務投資內地債券市場的主要渠道。債券通「北向通」於2022年的平均每日成交額達322億元人民幣（較2021年增加25%），佔境外投資者於中國銀行間債券市場整體成交額的61%。\n\n債券通「北向通」於7月份推出技術優化措施，包括將投資者參與境內債券一級市場發行的流程電子化及降低服務費。這些市場為本的優化措施提高債券通「北向通」的運作效率，亦降低投資者的交易成本。\n\n為完善債券通「北向通」的配套，並便利國際投資者管理內地債券投資相關的利率風險，香港與內地於7月宣布開展兩地利率互換市場互聯互通合作（「互換通」）。「互換通」初期會先開通北向交易，讓國際投資者透過香港與內地基礎設施機構之間的連接交易內地的利率互換產品，從而強化香港作為風險管理中心的地位。「互換通」籌備工作正在有序推進，以期盡快開通北向交易。金管局會繼續聯同有關當局及機構探索提供更多元化的風險管理工具，包括推出離岸國債期貨，進一步支持國際投資者投資內地債券市場。\n\n債券通「南向通」於2021年開通以來市場反應正面，運作暢順，交易涵蓋可在香港市場買賣並以多種貨幣計價的主要債券產品。「南向通」促進了離岸人民幣市場的發展，尤其人民幣計價債務工具發行的顯著增長。金管局正與內地有關當局緊密合作，研究優化債券通「南向通」，促進香港債券市場的多元發展。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Center\n\nIn 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopted a multi-pronged approach, achieving significant progress in enhancing Hong Kong's status as a globally competitive international financial center.\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit was successfully hosted, attracting over 200 international and regional leaders from approximately 120 global financial institutions, not only reinforcing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center but also generating a positive ripple effect.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB hub, across multiple areas including optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangements to ensure sufficient RMB liquidity and support the further development of offshore RMB products and markets. Jointly with the PBOC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the HKMA announced the launch of \"Swap Connect.\" In collaboration with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), the dual trading platform maker mechanism was introduced to promote the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong. Additionally, the HKMA launched a multi-year plan to further enhance financial market infrastructure and develop the Central Clearing and Settlement System for Debt Instruments into a major international central securities depository in Asia. Benefiting from ample RMB liquidity and supported by world-class market infrastructure and various interconnectivity mechanisms between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for mainland capital entering international markets and for international investors accessing the rapidly growing mainland market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has made significant progress in enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, and green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts towards overseas and mainland stakeholders, aiming to raise awareness of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the opportunities it presents.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to implement its \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, promoting broader adoption of financial technology by the financial sector to comprehensively consolidate Hong Kong's position as a FinTech hub. The fast payment system \"TransferFast\" continues to grow steadily, with the number of registered users surpassing 10 million in March and the average daily transaction volume also exceeding 1 million in September.\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional central banks and regulatory organizations, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center. In November, the HKMA organized the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit,\" implementing the initiatives announced by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget Address. The three-day summit gathered top leaders from the global financial sector, who shared their unique insights on how to seize opportunities amidst various uncertainties. The event received a strong response, attracting over 200 high-profile guests from approximately 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrating the global financial community's support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has further solidified its position as an offshore RMB hub, with offshore RMB business experiencing steady growth this year. Hong Kong plays a key role in facilitating capital flows between China's domestic financial markets and international markets. The interconnectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and mainland China are widely recognized as the preferred channels for international investors to access China's onshore capital markets and for mainland investors to allocate offshore assets. In 2022, the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect accounted for 61% of the total transaction volume of overseas investors in China's interbank bond market. Since their launch in 2021, Bond Connect's Southbound Trading and the Cross-Border Wealth Management Link have operated smoothly. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of \"Swap Connect,\" extending Hong Kong's financial cooperation with mainland China to the derivatives market and further strengthening Hong Kong's status as a major offshore RMB business hub and risk management center. The existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBOC was optimized in July, marking another significant milestone in enhancing Hong Kong's role as an offshore RMB hub.\n\nTo offer a more diverse range of RMB-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprising the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of RMB in Hong Kong's stock market. The working group has commenced preparatory work, including the introduction of a dual-counter market maker mechanism, to optimize the trading mechanism for stocks traded in both Hong Kong dollars and RMB.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to strive to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong's appeal as a preferred fund management center, the HKMA collaborates closely with the government and the financial sector to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong's bond market and solidifying Hong Kong's position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. Meanwhile, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts to introduce Hong Kong's financial services to overseas and mainland stakeholders.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Fintech Facilitation Office continues to collaborate with banking departments to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech and enhancing Hong Kong's status as Asia's fintech hub. Key initiatives to be rolled out this year include:  \n- Promoting the application of compliance technology and conducting fintech application assessments;  \n- Advancing work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) at the wholesale level, aiming to improve cross-border payments;  \n- Deepening research on issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC) at the retail level in Hong Kong (i.e., \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" or e-HKD);  \n- Launching the \"Commercial Data Exchange\" (CDE);  \n- Strengthening talent development;  \n- Leveraging resource policies to support the fintech ecosystem;  \n- Enhancing cross-border fintech collaboration; and  \n- Promoting broader adoption of the fast payment system \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System).\n\nThe reliable and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is crucial to maintaining Hong Kong's status as a major international financial center. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems processing interbank transactions, the Central Maturity Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Trade Repository all achieved 100% system availability, surpassing the target level of 99.95%. Settlement services for the Bond Connect \"Northbound\" and \"Southbound\" channels continued to operate smoothly. By year-end, the total outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund notes and bonds held in the CMU system reached HK$1,207.5 billion, while the total outstanding amount of other bonds increased to HK$1,573.3 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe usage of FPS continued to grow in 2022. By the end of 2022, there were a total of 11.48 million registered users, with daily transaction volume increasing by 40% compared to 2021. In addition to steady growth in person-to-person payments and business payments, the continued rise in FPS transactions for paying government bills, making payments to merchants, and topping up e-wallets of stored-value payment tools or bank accounts has been the main driver behind the significant growth in FPS transaction volumes.\n\nTo enhance the security and efficiency of local retail payment systems, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supervises six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed stored value payment tools (SVPTs), four of which are issued by licensed banks, under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Tools Ordinance (Payment Ordinance). Throughout the year, the HKMA continued to coordinate and facilitate communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and the licensed SVPTs appointed under the consumption voucher scheme to support the government's smooth implementation of the program.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a summary of the discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins released in January 2023, compiling the feedback received on the discussion paper and the HKMA's responses. The summary document confirms that the HKMA will regulate stablecoins in a risk-based and flexible manner, outlining the expected regulatory scope, key regulatory requirements, and next steps.\n\nAt the international level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively participates in central banking matters and plays a leading role in numerous regional and international committees. Since 2018, the HKMA has been re-elected as chairperson of the Financial Markets Working Group under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banking Conference (EMEAP) for three consecutive terms. Additionally, the HKMA serves as co-chair of the Policy and Standards Subgroup under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as co-chair of the Non-Bank Supervision Expert Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also leads the subgroup under the Financial Stability Board responsible for monitoring the progress of regulatory issues related to the transition of financial benchmarks and following up on these matters.\n\n# 2022 Review\n\n# International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\n\n\"The International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" was held from November 1st to 3rd.\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Financial Secretary in the 2022-23 Budget, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) held the \"International Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" in November. The three-day summit received a warm response, bringing together 26 industry leaders to share their unique insights and perspectives on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical instabilities, as well as seizing opportunities arising from these challenges. The summit attracted over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions, with more than 40 institutions represented by their Group Chairmen or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). The participating institutions included some of the world's largest banks, securities firms, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit sends a clear message to the global community that Hong Kong has fully recovered. Global financial leaders can personally experience the city's unique resilience and vitality, and gain insight into the opportunities Hong Kong offers for expanding business in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong as the main gateway to the mainland and the global offshore RMB business hub\n\nHong Kong is committed to consolidating its position as a global offshore RMB hub, through measures such as enhancing offshore liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with mainland financial markets, and improving financial market infrastructure. RMB-related activities, including bank deposits, trade settlement, payments, and offshore bond issuance, continued to record steady growth this year. Encouraging progress and achievements have been made in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding interconnected mechanisms. The results of the Bank for International Settlements' triennial survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover in 2022 once again confirmed Hong Kong's leading position as a center for RMB foreign exchange transactions.\n\nBond Connect's Northbound program continues to be the primary channel for international investors to access China's bond market through Hong Kong's market infrastructure and financial services. In 2022, the average daily trading volume of the Northbound program reached 32.2 billion yuan (an increase of 25% compared to 2021), accounting for 61% of the total trading volume by overseas investors in China's interbank bond market.\n\nIn July, Bond Connect's Northbound program implemented technical optimizations, including electronifying the process for investors to participate in domestic bond primary market issuances and reducing service fees. These market-oriented improvements have enhanced the operational efficiency of Bond Connect's Northbound program while also lowering investors' transaction costs.\n\nTo enhance the supporting measures for Bond Connect's Northbound Trading and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their investments in mainland China's bond market, Hong Kong and mainland China announced in July the launch of a connectivity cooperation initiative for their interest rate swap markets (\"Swap Connect\"). Initially, Swap Connect will commence with Northbound trading, enabling international investors to trade mainland China's interest rate swap products through connections between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a risk management hub. Preparations for Swap Connect are progressing in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching Northbound trading as soon as possible. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore a more diversified range of risk management tools, including the introduction of offshore China government bond futures, to further support international investors in investing in mainland China's bond market.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, the Bond Connect Southbound has received positive market responses and operated smoothly, with transactions covering major bond products that can be traded in the Hong Kong market and are denominated in multiple currencies. The Southbound Bond Connect has promoted the development of the offshore RMB market, particularly the significant growth in the issuance of RMB-denominated debt instruments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is closely cooperating with mainland authorities to study the optimization of the Bond Connect Southbound, aiming to promote the diversified development of Hong Kong's bond market.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2022年）\n","en":"# Reserve Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across multiple asset classes declining simultaneously. This not only challenged the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could mitigate risk, but also marked the first time in nearly half a century that stocks, bonds, and major non-dollar currencies all recorded negative returns. Under such adverse investment conditions, the Exchange Fund achieved a negative return of -4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses incurred by most multi-asset funds during the year, the Exchange Fund's performance reflected the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's diversified long-term asset allocation, as well as its defensive measures and strategic adjustments in response to evolving external circumstances, which effectively mitigated the impact of the market turmoil.\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nUnder the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and it may also be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems, thereby maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated and the terms of the delegated authority by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of Foreign Exchange Funds\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Fund:  \n(i) to protect capital;  \n(ii) to ensure that the overall monetary base is at all times fully supported by highly liquid U.S. dollar assets;  \n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is maintained to support monetary and financial stability; and  \n(iv) subject to compliance with the above (i) to (iii), to maximize investment returns in order to safeguard the Fund's long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe aforementioned objectives comprehensively take into account the statutory purposes of the foreign exchange fund and have been reflected in the fund's portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund's Investment Portfolio\n\nThe foreign exchange fund is primarily divided into two main portfolios: the support portfolio and the investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing full support for the currency base in accordance with the regulations of the currency board system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in the bond and stock markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), aiming to safeguard the value of assets and their long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has cautiously and gradually allocated part of the Exchange Fund's assets into more diversified asset classes, including emerging market and mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The target asset allocation for the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and other asset classes is jointly determined based on prudent risk management principles and asset diversification strategies.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has continuously held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the government for strategic purposes under the Exchange Fund's account. Due to its unique nature, this portfolio is not included in the investment performance evaluation of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Deposits in the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a notable exception. The interest rates on Future Fund deposits are tied to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate determined by the portfolio's composition. In 2022, the allocation of the Future Fund within the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is expressed as an investment benchmark, representing the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can adopt to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline, and through tactical asset allocation, it aims to achieve returns that exceed the benchmark. As a result, the actual asset allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is referred to as \"strategic deviation.\" The Financial Secretary sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and establish the allowable range for strategic deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the allowable range of strategic deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct Investment\n\nThe Exchange Fund Investment Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is responsible for the investment management and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. The office's staff directly manage approximately 70% of the Exchange Fund's investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. The internally managed portion of the portfolio includes diverse global fixed-income market investments, and the macro risk management strategies of the Exchange Fund are implemented through derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through its internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also employs external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other specialized asset categories. The engagement of external investment managers aims to leverage the expertise of top professionals in the market to generate sustainable returns for the Exchange Fund, enable it to benefit from diversified and complementary investment strategies, and gain insights into market practices and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nThe expenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary from year to year.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making the importance of risk management self-evident. The HKMA has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has set up a rigorous risk monitoring and compliance system. The HKMA has implemented a three-line defense mechanism for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and governance. The HKMA regularly monitors key investment risk categories, including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks, and the establishment of risk management procedures provides a robust framework for the strategic planning and diversified investment of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Foreign Exchange Fund and reduce environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks associated with investment activities. When ESG investments offer risk-adjusted long-term returns comparable to those of other investment options, the HKMA generally prioritizes ESG investments according to established guiding principles and has integrated ESG factors into the investment management processes of both the Foreign Exchange Fund's public and private market investments. Details regarding the HKMA's responsible investment framework and its implementation can be found in the \"Responsible Investment\" chapter of the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# 2022 Financial Market\n\nIn 2022, global financial markets experienced extreme volatility, with the bond market and stock market declining by 16.2% and 19.8%, respectively, representing a significant drop.\n\nHit by a surge in global inflation, tight monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock indices plummeted sharply this year. Despite a slight rebound in global stock markets at year-end driven by expectations of inflation peaking and interest rates hitting their peak, the U.S. S&P 500 index still fell by 19.4% for the year, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng index dropped 15.5%.\n\nCentral banks worldwide have aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation, triggering a sustained surge in government bond yields in major markets. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose from 1.63% in early 2022, climbing above 4% by the fourth quarter—the highest level since 2008. The U.S. Treasury yield curve has inverted since mid-year, with the inversion widening continuously and deepening market concerns about an economic recession.\n\nIn the currency market, driven by consecutive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, the US dollar significantly strengthened in 2022. Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan, saw their exchange rates against the US dollar sharply depreciate, with the British pound and Japanese yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% against the US dollar, respectively.\n\nTable 1 presents the performance of major currencies, the bond market, and the stock market in 2022.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Market Return\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HKD 205.4 billion in 2022, which included bond investment losses of HKD 53.2 billion, stock investment losses of HKD 80.5 billion (including HKD 61 billion in losses from overseas stock investments and HKD 19.5 billion in losses from Hong Kong stock investments), a HKD 40 billion foreign exchange valuation adjustment for non-HKD assets, and HKD 31.7 billion in losses from other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Foreign Exchange Fund. On the other hand, the Strategic Asset Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 8.7 billion.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, the total asset value of the Foreign Exchange Fund reached HK$4.008 trillion. The total market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio investments was HK$484.7 billion, with private equity accounting for HK$370 billion and real estate for HK$114.7 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment in the Long-Term Growth Portfolio was HK$270.8 billion.\n\nExcluding the strategic asset portfolio, the Foreign Exchange Fund's investment returns in 2022 were -4.5%, with the investment portfolio returning -8.6% and the support portfolio returning -0.4%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Foreign Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 displays the investment return rates of the Foreign Exchange Fund in 2022 and the average investment return rates over different periods.

By the end of 2022, the HKMA had launched a total of 148 sets of open APIs on its website as per the original plan.\n\n# Information Center\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International Finance Centre Phase 2. It serves as an important facility for introducing the HKMA's work and enhancing public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Information Centre comprises two sections: an exhibition hall and a library. The exhibition hall introduces the HKMA's work and the development of Hong Kong's currency and banking sector through interactive methods, and also provides reference materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong's currency, banking, and financial affairs. The adjacent library houses over 26,000 books, journals, and publications covering topics such as Hong Kong's currency, banking, finance, and central banking. In accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, the library also maintains the \"Register of Local Representative Offices of Authorized Institutions\" and the \"Register of Securities Business Employees of Authorized Institutions\" for public reference.\n\nAs the pandemic situation gradually stabilized, the Information Center gradually resumed its public guided tour services in the second half of 2022.\n\nAfter renovation, the brand-new library reopened to the public in March 2023.\n\n# Community Engagement and Public Education\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) work, the HKMA has been conducting public education seminars since 1998. In 2022, the HKMA held an online seminar that attracted over 2,200 students and teachers from 82 secondary schools. The seminar covered topics including an introduction to the HKMA's work, the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, safeguarding personal digital keys, the deposit protection scheme, and opportunities in the banking industry. To date, the public education seminars have recorded participation from over 65,000 people.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) educates and engages the public, reminding them how to be smart and responsible financial service consumers. Given the increasing number of phishing scams, the HKMA has launched a cross-media publicity campaign to further alert citizens to be cautious of fake hyperlinks in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks, as well as other types of scams involving deposits and credit cards. The HKMA has also organized radio and social media campaigns to disseminate tips on the smart use of credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, and other payment methods (including \"buy now, pay later\" products).\n\nA new short film titled \"Digital KEY: Watch Out, Think Twice Before Pressing the LINK!\"\n\nTo help citizens keep pace with the times and stay updated on the development of financial technology services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been promoting through social media and radio to encourage the public to send electronic red envelopes during the Lunar New Year period. The HKMA produced an animated short film explaining open APIs and introducing precautions to consider when using mobile applications from third-party service providers (such as online shopping platforms and mortgage service companies) to access banking services. The animated short film also introduces the App-to-App and Web-to-App payment features and advantages of \"FPS\" (Fast Payment System).\n\nAnimated short films help promote the public's digital financial literacy.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also committed to enhancing public understanding of the financial industry and encouraging the younger generation to join HKMA or the financial sector. In a newly produced interview video, graduates of the HKMA's Trainee Manager Program share their firsthand experiences, not only introducing the program to prospective applicants but also deepening their understanding of HKMA's work.\n\nGraduates of the Trainee Manager Program Share How to Prepare for an Interview\n\nTo enhance secondary students' financial literacy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with multiple relevant institutions, is co-organizing the 8th consecutive edition of the \"Hong Kong Financial Literacy Challenge.\" This year's theme focuses on green and sustainable finance, with students gaining new knowledge through an online quiz competition (which saw the highest number of participants in its history), webinars, and a design thinking competition.\n\nStudents present creative solutions incorporating green and sustainable elements in a design thinking competition to meet the need for managing personal finances.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the \"Little Financial Managers\" online parent-child financial education program during the March school break and August summer vacation in the 2021-22 academic year. Through animated short videos, storytelling, making simple toys, and sharing sessions with financial and early childhood education experts, the program enabled kindergarten and primary school students to learn about paper money and coins, basic concepts of banking and payment services, as well as financial knowledge.\n\nChildren learn financial concepts and skills online.\n\n# Financial Disclosure\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the HKMA adopts international financial disclosure standards applicable to central bank operations, including the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) and other relevant reporting requirements (such as the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standards). The Financial Department prepares the Exchange Fund's financial statements in accordance with HKFRS, with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. In addition, the HKMA provides detailed disclosure and in-depth analysis of each expenditure item and budget information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and Monitoring\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging risks in the monetary and banking system is one of the HKMA's most important responsibilities. Risk management is not only reflected in strategy formulation but also applied at the day-to-day operational level. The HKMA's risk management framework includes two high-level committees: the Macro-Overseeing Committee and the Risk Committee, both of which are chaired by the HKMA Governor.\n\nThe Macroprudential Oversight Committee's responsibilities are as follows:\n- Identify potential risks and threats facing Hong Kong's monetary and financial system, and discuss feasible measures;\n- Review existing risk management measures in the monetary and financial system, identify potential gaps, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and\n- Encourage cross-departmental sharing of macroprudential oversight information to enhance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's macroprudential oversight capabilities.\n\nThe mandate of the Risk Committee includes the following:\n- Identifying potential risks and threats faced by the HKMA and developing strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- Reviewing the existing risk management systems of each department, identifying potential vulnerabilities and significant risks, and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to address these situations;\n- Standardizing risk assessment criteria and methods, and determining the priority order for resource management based on identified risks; and\n- Encouraging and strengthening the risk management culture within the HKMA, promoting appropriate delegation and monitoring.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a robust operational risk management framework that covers organizational structure risks at both the institutional and departmental levels. Institutional-level risks generally refer to medium-term risks faced by the entire organization or risks that require cross-departmental collaboration to address. During implementation, each department is required to review and report on a quarterly basis its potential and emerging risks, along with the proposed monitoring measures and mitigation strategies. This is complemented by a top-down institutional risk management approach, where departmental management executives identify major risks with broader impacts and propose mitigation measures. The relevant assessments are regularly reviewed and appropriate follow-up actions are determined by the Risk Committee.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department independently and objectively assesses whether the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) governance, risk management, and monitoring processes are adequate and effective. The department reports functionally to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and administratively to the HKMA Governor. The Internal Audit Department employs a risk-based approach in conducting its audit work and information system reviews, covering all major risk areas.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第179頁至281頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2022年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2022年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共38,361.82億港元，金融負債共12,074.98億港元。\n\n87%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘13%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共4,876.94億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2022年12月31日共值233.94億港元。集團亦於4間聯營公司及22間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值396.31億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2022年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n林智遠教授\n\n審計署\n香港\n金鐘道66號\n\n2023 年 4 月 11 日\n","en":"# Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n- Audit Office Director's Report  \n- Foreign Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report by the Auditor General\n\n# Independent Auditor's Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nThis is to certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"Group\"), which are listed on pages 179 to 281. These financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2022, and the income and expense accounts, comprehensive income statement, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended on that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that the financial statements accurately and fairly reflect the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2022, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis of the Opinion\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements are detailed in the section of this report titled \"The Auditor's Responsibilities in Relation to the Audit of the Financial Statements.\" In accordance with these standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support my audit opinion.\n\n# KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters, based on my professional judgment, that were most significant to the audit of the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. I addressed these matters when auditing the overall financial statements and forming my opinion, but I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1 of the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value amounted to 3,836.182 billion Hong Kong dollars, and its financial liabilities amounted to 1,207.498 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe fair value of 87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities is based on quoted prices for the same assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 parameters), or estimated using valuation methods where the parameters used are based on observable market data (Level 2 parameters).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 13% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). The related financial assets amount to HKD 487.694 billion, primarily consisting of non-listed investment funds.\n\nGiven the large amounts involved and the involvement of estimates, the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for valuing financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluating and testing monitoring measures, including those related to application programs in computer systems;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and liabilities;\n- If market quotes are used, verifying the prices against independent sources;\n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verifying the parameters against independent sources; and\n- If the parameters used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, evaluating whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of Investment Properties Accounted for at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to Notes 2.11, 18, and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value and amounted to HKD 23.394 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds interests in 4 jointly controlled entities and 22 joint ventures, which are primarily engaged in holding overseas investment properties, with the total value of these interests amounting to HKD 39.631 billion. Regardless of whether the investment properties are held directly by the Group or through jointly controlled entities or joint ventures, their fair value is primarily determined by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:  \n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by jointly controlled entities or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant valuation reports;  \n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and  \n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for other information. Other information includes all the information in the 2022 Annual Report of the Financial Services Authority, but excluding the financial statements and my auditor's report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover other data, and I also do not express any form of attestation conclusion on other data.\n\nIn the context of financial statement audits, I have the responsibility to review other information in order to consider whether such information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with information obtained during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other information contains material misstatements, I need to report this fact. In this regard, I have no reports to make.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Secretary and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\n\nThe Financial Management Officer is responsible for preparing accurate and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls that they consider necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial officer must be responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, and where applicable, disclose matters related to continuing as a going concern, using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process.\n\n# The Responsibilities of Auditors in Relation to the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole do not contain any material misstatements resulting from fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not provide absolute assurance that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Office's audit standards will necessarily detect any material misstatements that may exist. A misstatement may be caused by fraud or error, and it is considered a material misstatement if it is reasonably expected to individually or in aggregate affect the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the audit process conducted in accordance with the audit standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address these risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to support my opinion. Since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, false statements, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements due to fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect those due to error;\n- Understand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not intended to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls;\n- Evaluate whether the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Commissioner are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates and related disclosures made are reasonable;\n- Determine whether the Financial Commissioner's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, assess whether there are material uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe such material uncertainties exist, it is necessary to draw the users' attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements in the auditor's report. If the related disclosures are insufficient, I must issue a non-unqualified auditor's report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly reflect the transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I take full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the audit committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the audit scope, timing, and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that I identified during the audit period.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, stating that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that are reasonably considered to potentially affect my independence, as well as the relevant preventive measures in applicable circumstances.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most significant to the audit of the current financial statements and thus constitute key audit matters. I describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless laws and regulations prohibit disclosure of a particular matter, or in extremely rare circumstances where I determine that communicating a matter in my report is reasonably expected to result in negative consequences that outweigh the public interest derived from such communication.\n\nProfessor Lin Zhiyuan, Director of the Audit Office\n\nAudit Office  \nHong Kong  \n66 Des Voeux Road\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}
