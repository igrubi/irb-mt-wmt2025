{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over

行政長官講話\n\n2021年是同時整固與發展的一年。\n\n在2021年，疫情踏入第二年，並未減緩：全球供應鏈受到干擾，通貨膨脹壓力上升，全球金融狀況過早緊縮的風險上升。加上新冠病毒變種的出現和地緣政治緊張局勢的升溫，更增添了不確定性。儘管如此，我們繼續保障貨幣和金融穩定，並維持營運韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來了復甦的希望，這得益於 COVID-19 疫苗的成功推出，以及在多個經濟體推出的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟開始從 2020 年的嚴重收縮中恢復。本地方面，在經歷了 2019 年和 2020 年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟在 2021 年增長了 6.3%，受惠於疫苗接種計劃的推出以及政府的疫情援助措施，這些措施為我們的經濟復甦提供了至關重要的支持。\n\n在金融及貨幣穩定維持，以及宏觀環境保持良好之下，2021年為我們提供了開展更多發展工作的空間。我們把握機會，並積極推進發展計劃，以協助我們的金融業保持高度競爭力。在我們的三大策略重點領域，即金融科技、綠色金融和來自香港的橋頭堡角色所產生的內地市場機會方面，已作出顯著進展。\n\n踏入2022年，全球環境變得惡化。但有云，時勢艱難，英雄輩出。我們將繼續主動，追求我們的發展的目標和優先事項，以便更好應對下一步挑戰，並鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅定不移地履行我們的承諾，確保香港貨幣和金融系統的健全，正如我們在過去多次應對了很多挑戰一樣。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心之基礎\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港金融體系的強大支柱，並有助於香港抵禦無數衝擊和挑戰。儘管持續的COVID-19疫情造成的憂慮以及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的擔憂，香港的港元外匯和貨幣市場全年在有序方式下繼續職能，反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健。\n\n對我們系統的信心並非一朝一夕之功，而是以穩健的基礎為基礎，歷經多年建立而成。 國際貨幣基金會在2021年的外部部門報告中再次重申，由於一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架，賴以保障了本地外匯風險保證計劃的信譽。\n\n信心亦是我們在公眾及市場參與方面的努力成果，以及有效監察的結果。至於後者，我們借助科技和數據分析來加強我們對金融穩定及宏觀審慎監察進行更及時和全面的分析能力。\n\n銀行體系的穩健性對香港的金融穩定至關重要。在COVID-19疫情爆發後的兩年，本港銀行仍然具有韌性，流動性狀況和資本充足率表現良好，符合國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行資本充足率高達20.2%，遠高於8%的最低要求，而大型銀行平均流動性保障比率在2021年第四季度為151.9%，亦遠高於100%的法定最低要求。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，但銀行業的資產質素在一年內大致保持穩定。行業不良貸款比率在2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的支柱\n\n一如既往，銀行業是經濟活動的重要支柱。鑑於COVID-19爆發所帶來的經濟影響，這一點更顯至關重要。在過去一年，主要挑戰是在管理銀行業信貸風險與維持該行業對實體經濟支持之間取得平衡。透過多年來的監管工作，銀行繼續有效管理信貸風險。與此同時，我們與銀行一同合作，透過預先批核本金還款暫緩計劃（PPPHS）和其他援助措施，為企業和個人客戶提供所需的支持。於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制一同推出的PPPHS，讓符合資格的企業客戶可以根據預先批核，將貸款本金還款延後六個月，在2021年再次延長兩度，至2022年4月，鑑於某些經濟領域仍經營環境艱難，且需要持續的信貸援助。其後，由於本地新冠病毒感染反彈，2022年2月，PPPHS進一步延長至2022年10月底。令人鼓勵的是，銀行業已攜手香港金融管理局，協助緩解企業和個人借款人的資金周轉壓力，即使該行業本身因疫情爆發而面臨自身的經營困難。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境，疫情亦帶來更艱難的營運環境，以及網絡威脅持續增加的數位環境。我們加強了提升銀行業營運及網絡安全韌性的努力，同時亦加強消費者及投資者保護，隨着數位化增加和網絡釣魚詐騙急升。特別是，銀行行為準則已修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n此外，我們致力於推動銀行業的金融普及和以客戶為中心的文化。增強客戶方便使用銀行服務，特別是那些有需要的人，一直是我們的工作重點之一，並且我們一直與業界緊密合作以制訂行業指引。除了關於無障礙銀行服務和為智力障礙人士提供銀行服務的指引外，業界在香港金融管理局的支持下，於12月2021年發出了一份指引，以建立有關銀行業為患有認知障礙症人士和有需要的客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好做法。\n\n為支持銀行業在未來持續發展，面對新的增長機會和挑戰，需要勞動力具備一套新的技能，香港金融管理局已制定「Connecting Talent to the Future」的全面人才發展策略，以培育未來人才，並以更系統化和專項的方式提升現有從業員的技能。 我們的策略建立於三個「聯繫」方向：聯繫學生與銀行業、聯繫從業員與銀行業的未來，以及聯繫主要持份者一同加強合作，以實施該策略。 我們已推出一系列外展和宣傳活動，以吸引更多學生進入銀行業。 為了更好準備大學學生，讓他們具備未來所需的準備，我們已聯同香港銀行專業發展學會推出「未來銀行橋樑計劃」，該計劃包括一系列涵蓋實用的銀行知識和銀行業高度需求的軟技能課程。 對於現有的銀行從業員，我們一直與業界緊密合作，發展更多提供在職培訓的機會。 在12月2021年，銀行從業員加強能力框架下的新金融科技模組已推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心的未來發展至關重要。我們將與所有持份者攜手合作，鑑於加強人才庫，以促進業界的進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強大的地位，由無可比擬的機會所支撐。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，由其提供的無可比擬的機會所支撐。普遍共識是，全球金融科技的採用、內地金融市場的開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的主流化，為香港金融業的未來發展呈現巨大機會。作為香港金融管理局，我們致力於利用香港獨特的優勢來把握這些機會。讓我介紹金融科技和內地機會，作為首個話題。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情已清楚顯示金融科技的力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為。為了使我們繼續暫停終止權於全球金融科技的領先地位，並準備就緒挖掘金融科技的全部潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓所有人、所有層面的人都能體驗到金融科技的價值。\n\n這個願景由於我們制定了新策略「金融科技2025」，並於2021年6月揭幕。正如其名稱所示，它旨在協助金融界全面應用科技，以至2025年。該策略包括五個重點範疇，涵蓋了爭取成功生態系統所需的要素，亦有助於生態系統以生生不息的循環進一步增長。策略的首個兩部分，即「所有銀行進行金融科技」和「加深研究香港以備中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）」主要旨在創造更多對應用金融科技的需求。策略的其他部分有關數據、基礎設施、人才和資金，這些對生態系統的增長至關重要。\n\n根據此策略，推出了一系列新舉措，例如廣東-香港-澳門大灣區（GBA）金融科技先導測試設施，該設施允許金融機構和科技公司進行先導測試，並從監管機構和用戶那裡獲取盡早的回饋，以了解其跨境金融科技舉措，以及商業數據交換的先導推出，該交換利用替代數據的使用來促進中小企業融資。我們亦加強了對批發央行數字貨幣（CBDC）應用於跨境支付的研究，並探討了電子港元的前景，這將提升香港採納央行數字貨幣的準備，並轉變我們的城市在未來數十年的金融基礎設施。\n\n在我們把握科技進步所帶來的新的機會的同時，亦繼續建立在我們現有的成果之上，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，於2018年推出的一項較快支付系統 (FPS) 經過這些年來的迅速發展，登記數目於2021年底達到960百萬，較去年上升40%。每日平均交易額亦上升九成，從2020年的水平達到2021年的約673,000即時交易。另一方面，鑑於加密資產，尤其用作支付用途的穩定幣的迅速發展，我們在本年初已推出一份討論文件，以邀請市場回饋，探討制定合適的監管框架。\n\n我們的全新、面向未來的策略將建立一個金融科技生態系統健康發展的局面。 隨著銀行業日益採納金融科技以把握其提供的機會，這最終將使金融機構和香港人受益，同時加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為通往內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一如既往地在連接內地市場與國際金融市場方面扮演著策略性地位，為國際投資者提供一個熟悉的制度和平台，以進行各種類型的金融、投資和財富管理活動。國家「十四五」規劃強化了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。這與全球經濟趨勢一同強化了我們的信心，認為香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場的獨特價值。\n\n於2021年，我們達到了一個提升聯繫的里程碑，加上兩項新成員加入我們的「聯繫」計劃系列，即大灣區跨境財富管理「聯繫」計劃（跨境理財WMC）和大證通南向交易，本質上完善了在廣泛的金融市場範疇中，包括股本、債務和財富管理，雙向互聯互通的循環。 這兩項計劃的推出將為香港帶來各種方面的新的機會。 通過滿足大陸投資者增加的多元化需要，這兩項計劃將擴大我們債券市場和財富管理行業的客戶基礎。 我高興見到這兩項計劃運作順利。 金管局將繼續與大陸當局保持聯繫，以便隨著時間的推移，進一步提升這些計劃。\n"}

摘要 2021\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在2021年，香港經濟在強勁的商品出口下回復正增長，同時帶動本地需求回升，並受政府支持政策措施的推動。勞動力市場亦改善，而通脹保持溫和，雖然微升。\n\n香港的銀行業保持穩定，資本和流動資金狀況良好。資產質量無論從歷史還是國際標準來看，都維持在健康的水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港的港元市場繼續暢順且有序地運作，儘管持續的憂慮是圍繞着新冠疫情以及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮。 聯繫匯率制度繼續良好地運作。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n隨著全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑，外匯基金錄得港元十億1,919的投資收入，相當於4.1%的投資回報率。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續其支持負責任投資和資產多元化的努力。自2009年成立以來，長期增長投資組合錄得年化內部收益率為15.4%。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n鑑於持續增加的網絡威脅和加快的數碼化，香港金融管理局繼續...重點放在銀行風險管理的監管。香港金融管理局已加強對銀行營運及網絡韌性的監管。銀行專業操守準則亦已修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n經過廣泛諮詢，粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理互聯互通（跨境理財互通）試點計劃已順利推出。香港金管局提供指引，協助銀行以良好的客戶體驗方式分銷投資及保險產品，同時提供保障。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資）方面，香港金融管理局的工作重點一直是進一步加強銀行防止及偵測與疫情期間上升的網絡金融犯罪相關的非法資金流動的能力。香港金融管理局亦深化了透過公私合作夥伴關係分享資訊，同時支持遠程客戶入職，並鼓勵採用其他科技包括網絡分析，透過推出首個反洗錢科技實驗室來實現。\n\n進一步在軟基礎設施的範疇作出努力，包括銀行文化和人才發展。\n\n良好進展已達致於本地實施國際監管標準，包括資本充足率和披露等。香港金管局亦推進其制定決議標準的工作，進行決議規劃和發展決議執行能力，以確保銀行具公信力的決議機制。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局公布其「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並加強香港在亞洲的金融科技中心地位。在快速支付系統方面，其登記和交易額已大幅發展，應用層面繼續擴大。\n\n在增強聯繫方面，跨境貨幣交換和透過「滬港通」的南向交易已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的地位。\n\n致力的努力亦致力於締造新商機，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業資金庫中心，以及綠色和可持續金融等範疇。\n\n為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強向各種持份者進行市場拓展，讓他們認識香港金融系統的韌性及它所提供的機遇。香港金融學院亦推出一個新金融領袖計畫，旨在培育香港的未來金融領袖。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated

2022 年的優先事項及前瞻\n\n全球及本地情況在進入2022年時顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢的升級以及市場對美國聯邦儲備局加息的預期觸發了市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟受到新一波新冠疫情的衝擊。儘管如此，鑑於香港金融系統的韌性和多年來建立的緩衝，香港的金融系統仍然保持良好地位，足以抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，金管局會繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。為此，我們將努力保持領先地位，識別新興風險並以靈活應變的方式做出回應。與此同時，金管局會尋求有助於鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心的地位的機會。在管理這複雜投資環境下的外匯基金時，金管局會繼續審慎投資，同時保持靈活，實施適當的防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系之穩定及誠信\n\n全球經濟前景保持受制於重大不確定性。香港金管局將讓緊跟最新發展，並對潛力風險保持警惕，旨在維護金融體系的韌性和穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的重要金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕，防範潛力風險\n\n展望未來，市場可能受制於隨着各種範疇上升的不確定性而加劇的波動。一方面，如果美國聯邦儲備局的貨幣政策正常化繼續以高步伐進行，可能明顯收緊全球金融狀況，並增加全球債務服務負擔。另一方面，鑑於烏克蘭局勢在2022年初的升級，包括中美緊張關係在內的 भू-राजनीतिक不確定性可能繼續保持高位，並再次引發金融市場的波動。最後但同樣重要的是，隨着反覆的疫情發展，可能出現一潛力下行情景，即如果大規模重新實施封鎖，導致持續的全球供應瓶頸，並對全球增長和通貨膨脹產生不利影響。儘管如此，香港的金融體系已建立良好的緩衝，並在過去的多年中積累了韌性，因此有能力抵禦不利衝擊。香港金融管理局亦具備能力、資源和承諾，以保障香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續緊密監察本地及外部環境的風險和脆弱性，並準備就緒在必要時採取合適措施，以維持香港的貨幣和金融穩定。二零二二年的研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛力風險。另一方面，金管局持續的數碼化計劃將協助提升其監察能力，以支援對金融系統更全面的監察和分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n隨著發達市場收緊貨幣政策，以及疫情的影響持續，銀行業面對的信貸環境預期將保持充滿挑戰。與此同時，迅速的科技進步和數位化為銀行業呈現機遇與挑戰。面對不斷改變的金融環境，香港金融管理局致力於確保銀行抵禦衝擊的能力，透過其持續的監管工作。與此同時，香港金融管理局亦將繼續提升和完善其銀行監管及規章框架和政策，並採取國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n於2022年，香港金融管理局將加強對銀行信貸風險敞口的監察，並推行主動措施以確保整體風險層面保持良好可控。\n\n香港金管局亦將繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業經營狀況的生效，並與銀行及商業界別維持接近對話，同時檢討各種援助措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n隨著於2022年5月發布的《新的監理政策手冊》（SPM）「運營韌性」模組，香港金融管理局將繼續保持聯繫業界，並了解認可機構（AIs）在發展其運營韌性框架方面的進展。同時，香港金融管理局將尋求提升銀行業的網絡韌性，透過跟進認可機構在《網絡韌性評估框架》2.0評估中揭示的問題，以及監察認可機構實施安全的第三層數據備份。另一項主要的監理重點將是評估和處理認可機構對科技服務供應商越來越大的依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉加強的數碼能力和廣泛的疫情期間累積的遠程工作經驗，一些人工智能正在計劃在正常營運的基礎上過渡到混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將會讓緊密關注此發展，並評估相關風險是否已獲業界充分處理。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n香港金管局將於2022年專注於監察人工智能的流動性及市場風險管理。特別是，香港金管局將繼續監察人工智能在過渡遠離餘下倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）設置方面的進展，直至這些設置於2023年6月30日停止發出。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n於2022年，金管局在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/打恐）方面的工作將繼續加強因應詐騙和金融犯罪的措施，透過合作和資訊共享，投身於與各種持份者在反洗錢\/打恐生態系統中加強合作。其他重點是實施廣大範圍的風險敏感型監管技術，利用加強的數據和監管科技（Suptech）能力，以及推動銀行使用Regtech，包括交易監控系統。\n\n香港金管局亦會讓與政府、銀行及儲值設施（SVF）界別緊密合作，新增香港洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估的更新版本，並協助業界對抗新興的風險。相關工作亦會繼續進行，以了解反覆出現的洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險，實施對反洗錢法規及相關指引的變更，以配合國際標準，並維持與其他監管機構及國際標準制定者的主動參與。\n\n# 財富管理及與強積金相關業務\n\n於2022年，香港金管局將會對人工智能在財富管理、證券銷售、強積金（MPF）和其他投資及保險產品方面的行為進行現場檢查及非現場監察，重點關注粵港澳大灣區「跨境財富管理聯繫」計劃（「跨境WMC」）、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產以及非投資連繫長期保險產品。\n\n在維持與其他監管機構和銀行業的緊密聯繫的同時，金管局將提供進一步的指引，以規範投資、保險和強積金產品的出售方面。這將涵蓋多個範疇，包括與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售與保險掛鈎計劃，這是一種新型的投資連繫保險計劃產品，具有高水平的保險保障。金管局、保險業監管局和強制性公積金計劃管理局將聯同推出一個神秘顧客計劃，以評估中介機構在定額即期年金保單和稅務扣減自願性供款的銷售實踐。\n\n以下在跨境WMC順利推出後，金管局將繼續參與業界和相關監管機構，以提升該計劃。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局將開始準備工作，以監管人工智能的信託業務，並制定新的SPM模組和新的行為準則。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續推動其監管下的金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全性及效率，根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）、金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI）1，以及支付與市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的各種指引。它將會因應最新科技及市場發展，對金融市場基礎設施的監管框架作精細調整。\n\n香港金管局將與金融市場基礎設施合作，遵守金融基礎設施原則（PFMI），並根據需要進行和更新評估。此外，香港金管局將繼續參與金融穩定委員會－國際證監會組織（CPMI-國際證監會組織）PFMI實施監測和評估的試驗。香港金管局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並因應市場和科技發展，以及配合國際慣例，加強其監管要求。香港金管局將與相關機關合作，在合適的情況下，進一步加強合作監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金管局將繼續提升和完善其銀行監理及規管框架和政策，並採取國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾協議\n\n# 資本標準\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續提升資本框架，具體包括近年來由銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）發出的標準，以下：\n\n於2013年12月發布的銀行對基金的股權投資資本要求（EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日生效，並隨著《銀行業（資本）（修訂）規則》2022年開始運作，經立法會完成負面審查後正式生效。\n\n經鑑於 2017 年 12 月的巴塞爾 III 後危機改革的修訂資本標準、2019 年 1 月的市場風險最低資本要求（2019 年 2 月修訂），以及 2020 年 7 月的專項信用評值調整風險框架修訂(條文)，這些統稱為「巴塞爾 III 最終改革方案」。 這些修訂的資本標準闡述了對信用風險、市場風險、信用評值調整 (CVA) 風險和操作風險的修訂處理，引入了產出下限要求，並提升了槓桿率框架。 為了使這些規定於 2023年7月1日生效作為最低要求（除了市場風險和 CVA 風險2 方面的規定外），正在與業界進行諮詢以準備對銀行（資本）規則 (BCR) 的修訂(條文)。\n\n鑑於資本處理主權集中風險的規定是旨在補充巴塞爾銀行監管委員會的大額風險框架，並已在銀行（風險限額）規則中實施，金管局將同時提出對資本規則的修訂(條文)，以配合對銀行（風險限額）規則的相關變更。\n\n# 暴露限值\n\n香港金管局將繼續與業界及律政司就建議修訂(條文)《銀行（風險限額）規則》的工作，目標實施日期符合與巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案相同的日期，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n新或修訂(條文)的披露要求，與巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案中的修訂後的資本標準相關，主要建立於巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發出的「Pillar 33 披露要求 –

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart

經濟與金融環境\n\n以強勁的商品出口、回升的內需，以及政府支持政策措施的推動，香港經濟在2021年回復正增長，扭轉了2019年和2020年經歷的收縮。勞動力市場亦改善，通脹仍然溫和，雖然微升。 雖然預期在第五波新冠疫情減退後，經濟復甦將繼續，但其強度和速度受制於不確定性和風險，尤其是由疫情造成的以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 實際活動\n\n由於強勁的商品出口和改善的本地需求，香港經濟在2021年增長了6.3%，結束了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮（表1和圖1）。私人消費受惠於改善的勞動力市場狀況和政府消費券計劃1帶來的推動而復甦。整體投資支出亦反彈，因為營商環境和前景改善2。在外部方面，香港的商品出口在整年錄得強勁增長，其中一章受到全球經濟繼續復甦的支持。服務出口錄得溫和增長，反映活躍的區域貿易和貨物流動，以及更強的跨境業務和金融活動。總進口大幅上升，主要由於更大規模的本地和轉口帶動需求。從淨值來看，外部貿易在2021年對本地生產總值(GDP)增長帶來支持（圖1），因為總出口增長較快於進口。\n\n表

通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力微升但於一年內仍然溫和。剔除政府一次性救濟措施的效應，按年計的基礎通脹率逐步上升至12月的輕微1.4%（圖2）4。餐飲、交通、衣履等消費品價格重拾上升動力，原因是本地消費需求改善。進口價格亦隨着全球供應鏈的瓶頸以及國際能源和商品價格的急升而顯著上升。相反，房屋成分拖累整體通脹，反映了較早前私人住宅新租賃租金下跌的影響（圖2）。大致而言，名義工資和商業租金的增長緩慢有助於讓國內企業的成本壓力維持在可控水平。對於整體而言，2021年的基礎和整體通脹率分別維持在0.6%和1.6%的溫和水平。\n\n圖 2 潛在消費者物價膨脹\n來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n隨著國內經濟的復甦，勞動力市場在2021年得到改善。失業率在2月達到17年高位的7.2%，隨後明顯下降至12月6日的4.0%（圖3），且這種下跌在大多數經濟部門都是廣泛的。整體勞動需求隨著總就業和私營部門職位空缺的增加而逐步轉強，儘管它們仍低於疫情爆發前的峰值。另一方面，與去年同期相比，勞動力在12月略微減少1.3%，部分由於勞動力參與率的溫和下跌。2021年前三個季度的名義工資和勞動收入的同比增長，雖然溫和，但顯示出加速的跡象，扭轉了2019及2020年的放緩趨勢。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在今年大致呆滯，儘管一些主要海外股權市場繼續反彈（圖4）。 恆生指數延續於年底2020年的反彈，於2021年2月17日上升至31,085點的高位，但由於多種因素，包括對新COVID-19病毒變種的憂慮、主要中央銀行潛在的貨幣政策收緊以及互聯互通7下南向交易流入減少，市場情緒自此急轉為負面。 恆生指數以23,398收報，較一年前顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部和香港交易所。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅房地產市場在2021年首個半年重拾一些上升動力，隨著更好經濟機遇，但隨着資產市場氣氛轉弱，出現了一些整固（圖4）。整體而言，房屋價格和交易量在2021年仍錄得3.7%和24.1%的上升，分別為此。家庭負擔能力亦變得偏緊，部分反映家庭收入減少。另一方面，在2019年和2020年經歷顯著調整後，非住宅房地產市場一般改善，工業物業的價格和租金一般上升至疫情爆發前的峰值，而零售和辦公空間則仍然低於各自的峰值。\n\n見到表B：主要經濟指標，詳細資料請見326頁至327頁，包括它們在2017年至2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n在盡早2022年，第五波本地COVID-19感染造成對本地經濟活動的壓力。為此，政府推出第五輪及第六輪「抗疫基金」，並在2022–23預算下增加反周期措施以協助支持經濟。金管局一同與銀行業延長「預先批准本息償還緩期計劃」至10月年底。\n\n對於整體而言，預計2022年的經濟復甦將繼續，雖然步伐相比2021年會更加溫和，這部分反映了第五波新冠肺炎疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、較不利的基礎生效以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年的實際本地生產總值增長將在1–2%的範圍內，而國際組織和私營部門分析員的最新增長預測平均為1.1%。儘管如此，復甦的強度和步伐受制於眾多不確定性和風險，尤其是在疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑造成的影響。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n隨著上升的進口價格和疫情造成的物流中斷，預測通脹壓力在短期內將略微上升，但由於租金疲軟和輕微的本地勞工成本壓力，應大致受到控制。市場共識預測2022年的整體通脹率為2.4%，而政府預測整體和核心通脹率將分別為2.1%和2.0%。2022年初，第五波本地新冠肺炎感染造成了對勞動力市場的壓力，尤其是在聯絡密集的行業。更長遠來看，勞動力市場狀況將取決於疫情發展和國內經濟復甦的步伐。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港的銀行業於2021年繼續保持穩定。 總體銀行資產適度擴大，貸款和存款均上升。 銀行業的資本和流動性狀況仍然良好。 資產質量無論從歷史還是國際標準來看，都維持在健康的水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業資產負債表於2021年增長了1.9%。由於經濟復甦，全年總貸款錄得3.8%的增長，相比2020年的1.2%。在總貸款中，用於香港的貸款增長了4.4%，用於境外的貸款增長了1.1%，貿易融資上升了14.2%。與大陸相關的貸款在2021年擴大3.6%，此前在2020年大致保持穩定。\n\n在負債方，總存款在2021年上升了4.6%，相比2020年的5.4%。由於總存款的步伐上升較快於總貸款，整體貸款存款比率在2021年底微升至71.8%，較一年前的72.3% (圖5) 略降。\n\n圖5 銀行業貸款及存款\n來源：金管局。\n\n# 資本適足性\n\n銀行業的資本狀況仍然良好。本地註冊的認可金融機構（金融機構）的合併總資本比率在2021年底高達20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖6）。這兩個比率均遠高於其分別的國際最低要求，分別為8%和6%。\n\n巴塞爾（iii）槓桿比率在2021年底為7.9%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性地位良好。2021年第四季度，第1類機構8的平均流動性覆蓋比率 (LCR) 為 151.9%，良好\n\n高於法定最低要求的100%。第二類金融機構的季度平均流動性維持比率 (LMR) 為59.1%，亦良好地高於法定最低要求的25%（圖8）。\n\n圖8 指定人工智能的流動性比率\n來源：金管局。\n\n銀行業的資金來源仍然穩定。第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）在2021年底為135.3%，遠高於法定的100%最低要求。 核心資金\n\n類別2A機構的資本充足率（CFR）在2021年底為150.3%，亦遠高於法定的最低要求75%（圖9）。\n\n圖 9 指定人工智能的資金比率\n來源：金管局。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n資產質素於該年仍然穩定，並符合歷史及國際標準的健康水平。壞賬比率於2021年底為0.88%，相比2020年底的0.90%，而逾期及重組貸款比率於該期間微升至0.56% ，由0.57% (圖10)。與中國大陸相關的貸款的壞賬比率於2021年底為0.86%，相比2020年底的0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的違約比率分別維持低位，為0.04%及0.20%

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管持續的憂慮造成的 COVID-19 疫情不確定性，以及對美國貨幣緊縮步伐上升的憂慮，香港的港元外匯和貨幣市場繼續以暢順和有序的方式交易。自1983年實施以來，作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度展現了其抵禦外部衝擊的實力與韌性。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港的貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在與美元的外匯市場中，於7.75港元至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內的穩定外部匯價。貨幣制度的結構主要採用貨幣委員會安排，需要貨幣基礎最少有100%的美元儲備支持，這些儲備由外匯基金持有，且貨幣基礎的變動需與相關的美元儲備變動配合。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表 1）包括：\n\n債務憑證，為三家發行銀行發行的銀行券提供全面支持；政府發行的在流通中的貨幣紙幣及硬幣；總結餘，即存放在金管局的結算戶餘額總和；以及金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制以及香港金融管理局堅決履行港幣兌換基金承諾（CUs）來維持。當強方（或弱方）的港幣兌換基金承諾被觸發時，香港金融管理局準備就緒隨時根據要求以每美元7.75（或7.85）的價格向銀行買入（或賣出）香港美元，總結餘會擴大（或縮小），從而促使香港美元利率下降（或上升），協助促使香港美元回到7.75至7.85的港幣兌換基金區間之內。\n\n# 二零二一年檢討\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n由於與籌資活動及港股通相關的股權需求，香港美元在年初接近強方價位成交。 隨着股市修正及部分新上市企業匯回首次公開募股（IPO）收益，其後香港美元轉弱，但在第二季度由於企業股息支付需要及港股通南向資金淨流入而略有反彈。 踏入下半年，儘管香港美元在回軟的股市情緒下有所下跌，但它大致維持在可兌換區域的強方，並繼續以暢順和有序的方式運作（圖1）。整體而言，香港外匯市場在2021年全年的運作情況正常。\n\n圖 1 2021年市場匯率\n\n由於沒有觸發保儲準則，總結餘及未償還的交換基金票據總額在2021年仍然無大變動，約為港元15,263十億元（圖2）。在該年，金管局發行總額為港元80十億元的增加交換基金票據，以滿足銀行對交換基金票據的持續需求，隨着銀行體系充裕的流動性，導致總結餘從2020年底的港元457.5十億元收縮至2021年底的港元377.5十億元。\n\n反映了根據既定做法發行額外交易所基金票據及發行盈餘聯票以吸納盈餘聯票的利息支出，於本年未償還的盈餘聯票由港元1,069.2十億上升至港元1,148.8十億。貨幣基礎整體仍然十足地由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 港元15,263十億\n\n總餘額及未償還的EFBNs\n\n圖 2 總結餘 (未扣除再貼現窗口) 及 2021 年未償還之交換基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n憑藉龐大的總餘額，港元同業拆息於全年中仍然大致穩定於低層面（圖 3）。儘管首個季度隨著首次公開招股活動的增加，對港元的 nhu cầu 上升，但各種期限的香港銀行同業拆息錄得輕微波動。此後，儘管對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮，香港銀行同業拆息仍然大致穩定。接近2021年底，香港銀行同業拆息錄得輕微上升，部分反映了對年底資金需要 的預期。在零售方面，銀行維持其最佳貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續正常職能。2021年再貼現窗口借款下降至68億港元，較2020年的91億港元減少。\n\n圖 3 香港 2021 年銀行同業拆息利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯繫匯率）在過去三十多年一直是香港金融體系的強大支柱，並已展現其應對挑戰的實力與韌性。儘管全球經濟復甦造成的持續的uncertainties，香港的港元外匯和貨幣市場繼續以有序方式運作，反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健。政府堅決致力於聯繫匯率制度。在其2021年外部部門報告中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的信譽已透過一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強勁的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架得到保障。\n\n一個良好的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業繼續順利營運，流動性狀況和資本充足率表現良好，符合國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局一直緊密監察銀行對信貸、流動性和利率風險的管理以及壓力測試結果，並維持其對銀行貸款的監管工作。\n\n為優化貨幣委員會帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月以來，已配置特定部分的結匯基金資產作為貨幣基礎的支持。支持比率（定義為支持資產分為貨幣基礎）在2021年內上落於109.8%至110.5%的範圍，而未觸及上下觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報110.2%（圖4）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然特定結匯基金資產已指定用於支持投資組合，但所有結匯基金資產均可獲得以支持香港元的匯率。結匯基金充裕的財政資源，一同與健全的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強大的在...下保障。\n\n圖4每日支持比率在2021年的變動\n\n# 貨幣局委員會\n\n貨幣板委員會（下稱委員會）是外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的一個委員會，負責監察和檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2021年，委員會探討了多項議題，包括評估美國的通貨膨脹、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估縮減量化寬鬆政策引發的風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解與中國大陸相關的資金流向對香港貨幣狀況的影響。委員會就這些議題的討論錄得，並提交給委員會的貨幣板運作報告均已在香港金融管理局網站上發出。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n於2021年底，由票據發行銀行發行的在流通紙幣總值為港元5,926十億，較前一年上升5.9%（圖5、6和7）。於2021年底，政府發行紙幣及硬幣在流通總值為港元129億，較去年上升1.7%（圖8和9）。\n\n# 港元5,926十億，+5.9%\n\n發行銀行發行紙幣的總價值\n\n# 港元129億，+1.7%\n\n政府發行紙幣及硬幣總值\n\n# 圖

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022

銀行穩定性\n\n儘管COVID-19更具傳染性的變種病毒出現，導致全球經濟復甦的不確定性，香港的銀行業在2021年仍然穩定。在該年，金管局繼續...重點放在對認可機構風險管理的監管。鑑於銀行業中網絡威脅持續增加和數位化加快，對認可機構的營運及網絡安全監管亦加強。\n\n在行為監理方面，香港金融管理局提供指引予銀行，以促進使用非面對渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作制定市面上新產品（例如與保險掛鈎證券和虛擬資產）的監理要求。銀行行為準則亦已修訂，以提升數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢／打擊恐怖主義融資）領域中，香港金融管理局的工作重點一直是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中的龍門角色及其防止及偵測與疫情期間網上詐騙、傀儡帳戶網絡和其他金融犯罪相關的非法資金流動的能力。為加強對客戶帳戶免受詐騙和金融犯罪的保護，香港金融管理局深化了與其他持份者的合作和資訊分享，透過公私合作夥伴關係進行。在支持遠程客戶開戶的同時，香港金融管理局亦鼓勵採用其他科技，包括網絡分析，透過在11月推出首個反洗錢科技實驗室。在國際層面，主動參與使香港金融管理局在金融行動專案組的全球反洗錢／打擊恐怖主義融資工作中保持領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理互聯互通試點計劃於9月順利推出。在過去一年，香港金融管理局繼續執行其為期兩年的推動香港監管科技應用路線圖。 若干措施亦已推出，以奠定銀行氣候風險管理的基礎，並大致推動綠色和可持續銀行業的發展，詳情請參閱可持續發展章節。此外，亦在軟基礎設施方面作出努力，包括推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出能力建設舉措，以促進人才發展。\n\n另一方面，金管局與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監理政策和流程。在本地實施國際監理標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露等。金管局繼續推進其工作，以確保認可機構擁有具公信力的決議機制，包括發展新決議標準和實施有關損失吸收能力要求的規則，以提升認可機構的可決性。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的一般目標是推動銀行體系的安全和穩定。實現此目標當取決於一個高度具韌性的金融體系，該體系能夠提供香港經濟需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營業務的方式，以及在極端個案中以失序方式倒閉，可能影響系統的穩定性。 作為監管機構，貨幣當局在確保銀行能恢復其在危機中的地位，並最終幫助防止倒閉，從而維護金融穩定方面發揮著關鍵作用。 貨幣當局負責對銀行進行審慎監理，並負責授權在香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，它們統稱為認可機構。\n\n然而，貨幣機管局無法確保，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣機管局作為決策機關，致力於確保在認可機構出現不可行之時，其倒閉可以以有序方式管理。為此，香港已為金融機構設立決策機制，其中貨幣機管局是認可機構的決策機關，也在其他類型的機構之間。為了落實香港的決策機制，制定決策規則和政策標準、進行決策規劃以消除認可機構可決策性的障礙，以及制訂香港金融管理局解決陷入困境的認可機構的運營能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些工作，香港金融管理局採納了國際協調一致的方法。\n\n貨幣管理局亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施（金融市場基礎設施）。在監督金融市場基礎設施方面，香港金管局的目標是促進它們的一般安全和效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。 提高金融市場基礎設施對金融危機的復原力，可保護香港的貨幣和金融系統免受金融市場基礎設施中斷所產生的可能破壞效應。 關於香港金管局的監督方法的信息可獲得於香港金管局網站。\n\n# 二零二一年檢討\n\n# 授權\n\n於2021年底，香港擁有：\n\n年內，金管局授予三間非本地銀行兩張銀行牌照和一間受限制銀行牌照。金管局亦授予一間外地交易平台營運商資金經紀批核。年內，三間持牌銀行和兩間受限制牌照銀行的授權均被撤銷。\n\n更多關於人工智能和在香港的代表辦事處的資訊，載於附件和表 D 至 F，分別在第 321 至 324 頁和 330 至 333 頁。\n\n# 監察活動簡介\n\n香港金融管理局進行了189項非現場覆查，涵蓋廣泛的議題範圍，包括CAMEL評級評估1、企業管治、風險管理和金融科技（Fintech）策略。作為香港金融管理局繼續推動更強風險管治的努力之一，已與資產經理的委員會、獨立非執行董事或委員會層面舉行了40次會議。此外，香港金融管理局、資產經理及其外部審計師之間又舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動，香港金融管理局進行定期現場檢查，並輔以對評估風險較高範疇的重點審查。本年共進行了679次現場檢查和重點審查，信貸風險管理為主要重點。隨着銀行越來越廣泛地採用科技，營運風險和科技風險的管理是另一主要注意範疇。香港金融管理局亦上升了現場檢查和重點審查的數目，針對流動性及市場風險管理。此外，專門團隊對人工智能在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務中的活動，以及它們的反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）控制進行了現場檢查和重點審查。表1載有香港金融管理局2021年監管活動的概要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款在2021年上升了3.8%，相比2020年的1.2%增長。表2顯示貸款和推進的分類。\n\n與內地相關的貸款於2021年上升3.6%至港元47,250十億元（表3）。\n\n銀行業資產品質在該年仍然大致穩定，並在歷史和國際標準下維持在良好水準。 業內不良貸款比率在2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。與大陸相關的貸款比率亦下降至0.86%，較一年前的0.96%為低。\n\n在該年期間，新冠肺炎疫情繼續對經濟某些行業造成影響，而中國大陸房地產行業的信用事件引起了市場的注意。 金管局加強了監察的廣度和深度，並對銀行對高度借助借款人的風險敞口進行了深層審查。 金管局與銀行保持良好聯繫，以促進對經濟和市場發展的影響以及銀行風險管理措施是否足夠的最新評估。 銀行業整體信貸風險被評估為可控。 金管局償付能力壓力測試的最新結果證實，銀行業繼續維持足夠的緩衝，以抵禦極端壓力。\n\n專項及主題檢查在該年進行，以評估人工智能系統在貸款分類和貸款損失準備、海外貸款業務以及為私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的抵押貸款方面的控制。\n\n# 紓緩客戶面對的資金周轉壓力\n\n9月，香港金融管理局與銀行界中小企業（中型）貸款協調機制公布將「預先批准本金還款假期計劃」延長6個月，至2022年4月底。此計劃於2020年5月首個推出，旨在為合資格企業客戶延後貸款本金還款6個月。鑑於本地新冠病毒感染反彈，2022年2月，該計劃進一步延長至2022年10月底。此外，該計劃加強，為那些金融能力許可並願意逐步恢復還款的客戶提供1年期部分本金還款選項。\n\n截至2021年12月年底，銀行已批准貸款期限延長及其他形式的救濟措施超過8萬3千個案，涉及總額超過9200億港元。 對於個人客戶，銀行已批准超過5萬2千個住宅按揭及其他個人貸款的本金還款假期個案，總額超過530億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局推出的多輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已轉強銀行風險管理，以及銀行業對本地房地產市場可能突然下跌的抵禦能力。於2021年12月批准的新住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數為53%，相比2009年9月在推出首個逆周期措施之前為64%。2021年12月，新按揭貸款的平均債務服務比率仍然低於36%，相比2010年8月首次應用債務服務比率上限時的41%。（圖1）\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n鑑於銀行對科技以支持其運營的依賴日益增加，香港金融管理局加強了對營運和科技風險的監管。本年主要的監管重點包括對雲端外包和遠程工作安排的控制。香港金融管理局於12月推出了一份關於「營運韌性」的新監督政策手冊（SPM）草案的行業諮詢。新的SPM草案旨在提供指引，協助銀行發展一個全面且綜合的營運韌性框架。\n\n香港金融管理局於1月推出網絡韌性評估框架2.0，以反映最新的網絡安全風險管理良好慣例。在該年內，香港金融管理局監察人工智能機構實施網絡韌性評估框架2.0的情況，並檢視它們的網絡韌性能力。鑑於破壞性網絡攻擊的風險越來越高，於5月，香港金融管理局要求所有人工智能機構評估是否需要安全的第三層數據備份，並參考香港銀行協會發布的《安全第三層數據備份指引》。\n\n為因應日益增加的風險和上升的網絡釣魚攻擊次數，金管局與業界緊密合作，加強網上及手機銀行服務的安全性。一項大規模的香港金管局與香港銀行公會合辦的公眾意識活動，主題為「保障您的個人數碼密匙；提防欺詐連結！」，於7月開始（圖示1）。\n\n圖示

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms)

國際金融中心\n\n於2021年，香港金融管理局透過多管齊下的方式，在加強香港作為全球競爭力國際金融中心的地位方面，達致良好進展。\n\n香港金融管理局揭示「金融科技2025」策略，以推動金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並鞏固香港作為金融科技中心的地位，大致而言。在快速支付系統方面，隨着新冠肺炎疫情，今年度見到交易額急升。\n\n在增強聯繫方面，本年作出重大進展，包括將「跨界財富管理互聯互通」和「債券通南向交易」納入「互聯互通」計劃系列。受惠於香港世界一流的市場基礎設施和「互聯互通」計劃，香港是內地資金挖掘全球市場以及國際投資者進入越來越蓬勃的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n亦在2021年，香港金融管理局致力於締造新業務機遇，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，範疇包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業資金中心，以及綠色和可持續金融。為推動香港金融服務，香港金融管理局加強了對海外及內地持份者的市場宣傳，讓他們認識香港金融系統的韌性及它所提供的機遇。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局積極參與國際及區域性的中央銀行和監管論壇，作出貢獻於全球維持金融穩定和推動金融市場發展的努力。\n\n# 簡介\n\n香港金融管理局公布其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一連串的措施以推動金融科技的廣泛採用，並加強香港在亞洲金融科技中心的地位。 金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門一同在該年推動各種關鍵措施，包括以下：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）採用\n推出科技基準評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣中心的地位仍然堅決，在該年，離岸人民幣業務登記情況良好，並持續增長。 隨著主要金融市場指數中納入在岸證券，流入人民幣資產的步伐持續加快。香港在促進國際投資者增加對人民幣資產的配置方面發揮著不可或缺的作用，而「滬港通」和「深港通」計劃被廣泛接受為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場的首選渠道。2021年，北向通債券交易每日成交額上升34%，達到約258億人民幣。\n\n以下北向通的成功，南向通於9月份推出，完善了內地與國際債券市場的兩way連接。 同一個月份，中國人民銀行（PBoC）、香港金融管理局和澳門貨幣當局頒布了在粵港澳大灣區（GBA）實施《跨境財富管理聯繫》（Crossboundary WMC）計劃的細節。 10月，香港合資格銀行開始與其內地合作銀行一同提供跨境財富管理聯繫服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港的地位作為主要的離岸人民幣中心，一個由香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和香港交易所共同組成的專案組成為，以進行一項研究，探討在香港推動人民幣計價股權證交易的可行性。中國人民銀行與香港金融管理局亦於12月合辦了一場研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心和領導人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續作出進展，接近加強香港金融平台的競爭力。特別是，為了上升香港作為首選基金註冊地的吸引力，香港金融管理局與政府及金融業界合作，提供更便利的基金設立稅務及監管環境。在進一步提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位方面，亦作出重大進展，同時亦提升了香港的債券發行中心地位。與此同時，香港金融管理局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推動香港的金融服務。\n\n安全且高效的金融基礎設施運作，對於鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心的地位至關重要。於2021年，四個銀行間即時總結算（RTGS）系統、中央資金市場單位（CMU）和香港貿易庫存庫均達致100%系統可用性，表現優於99.95%的目標。在9月推出南向通後，中央資金市場單位變得是透過北向通和南向通進行的交易的結算及保管服務供應商。\n\n於2021年，快速支付系統的使用繼續擴大。登記數目增長至960百萬，截至2021年底，而該年度的平均每日交易額較2020年上升九成。 更多人使用快速支付系統繳納政府帳單、進行商戶付款以及增值儲值設施（SVF）電子錢包或銀行帳戶，是推動力持續上升交易量的主要因素，加上個人對個人和企業付款的穩定增長。\n\n為推動本地零售支付行業的安全和效率，金管局負責監察六個指定的零售支付系統（RPS），並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）監管15間領取牌照的儲值支付工具。在過去一年，金管局透過協調及推動相關政府部門與為該計劃委任的儲值支付工具持牌人之間的對話與合作，促進政府消費券計劃的暢順運作。\n\n於2022年1月，香港金融管理局發佈了一份關於加密資產和穩定幣的討論，闡述了香港金融管理局對相關監管方法的思考，並邀請持份者提供回饋。相關因素，包括對此討論的回饋以及相關國際機構的建議，將會被採取考慮，以制定合適的監管制度。\n\n國際上，香港金融管理局是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在數目眾多的區域及國際委員會中扮演領導角色。例如，香港金融管理局主持《東亞太平洋中央銀行高級管理層會議》（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）。香港金融管理局亦聯席主席巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）的政策與標準小組、非銀行監察專家小組，以及金融穩定委員會（FSB）的金融創新網絡，並促使一個團隊研究與金融基準轉型相關的監管問題。\n\n# 二零二一年檢討\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n6月，香港金融管理局揭示了其「金融科技2025」策略，以帶動香港的金融科技發展。該策略目標是鼓勵金融界全面應用科技至2025年，並推動為香港市民和經濟提供公平且高效的金融服務。該策略的五個重點範疇是：\n\n所有銀行進行金融科技轉型\n加深研究香港的央行數位貨幣準備\n締造下一代的數據基礎設施\n擴展精通金融科技的人才隊伍\n透過資金和政策扶植生態系統\n\n香港金融管理局的「金融科技2025」策略推動香港的金融科技發展。\n\n# 金融科技在銀行業的採用\n\n為配合「金融科技2025」策略的「銀行全面發展金融科技」倡議，香港金融管理局於2021年6月推出科技基線評估。評估的目標是協助香港金融管理局更好理解當前銀行業的金融科技範疇，並識別哪些金融科技範疇可能需要香港金融管理局的協助。所有在香港有重要業務的持牌銀行均被要求在2021年底前制訂為期三年的金融科技採用計劃。\n\n年內，香港金管局亦繼續實施其兩年期路線圖，以推動香港銀行採用監管科技，並在其自身的監管流程中融入科技，以優化效率和效能。詳見銀行穩定性章節第98頁。\n\n# 批發央行數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局與泰國銀行於2021年2月擴大其聯合研究項目的範圍，加入了阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行和中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所。該項目更名為「多央行數字貨幣橋樑 (mBridge)」，並得到銀行國際結算中心（BIS）香港創新樞紐大力支持，進一步探討分布式分類帳技術促進即時跨境外匯交易對沖（PvP）交易的能力，適用於多司法管轄區環境和24\/7全天候運營。一份聯合報告於9月發出，以提交中期結果，隨後於11月發布潛力使用個案和未來路線圖。\n\n# 零售中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在央行數字貨幣（CBDC）準備方面的未來，香港金融管理局開始了一項研究，探討在香港發行零售央行數字貨幣的潛力，即電子港元，涵蓋技術和政策考量。香港金融管理局與銀行國際結算中心（BIS）香港創新中心合作，展開了題為 Project Aurum

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange

儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑。儘管全球經濟繼續受影響反覆的COVID-19疫情狀況，但多項因素，包括增加的疫苗接種率以及世界各地寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施，帶來支持全球經濟和金融市場的致力復甦。在此背景下，多個海外股市在當年達致歷史新高，而外匯基金整體股權投資能爭取不俗的回報，儘管香港股市表現呆滯。於2021年，外匯基金錄得投資收入港元1,919十億，相當於4.1%的投資回報。\n\n# 結匯基金\n\n香港外匯基金的首要目標，如《外匯基金條例》所訂明，是影響香港貨幣的匯價，直接或間接均可。該基金亦可能被使用以維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和完整性，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心。金管局在財政司司長轉授的權力下，並在轉授條款的範圍內，須對財政司司長負責外匯基金的使用和投資管理。\n\n# 結匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已建立外匯基金的以下投資目標：\n\n（i）保障資本；\n（ii）確保整個貨幣基礎，在任何時候，都由高度流通性高的美元資產十足支持；\n（iii）確保有足夠的流通性可獲得，以維持貨幣和金融穩定；以及\n（iv）受制於（i）–（iii），爭取投資回報，以協助保障交換基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定目的，並已註冊於基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置之中（圖示 1）。\n\n圖示 1 結匯基金投資組合分類\n\n大致來說，外匯基金擁有兩主要投資組合：支持組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支持組合持有高度流通性高的美元資產，以提供全面支持給貨幣板安排項下所需的基本貨幣供應。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作暨發展機構成員經濟體的債券和股權市場，以保障其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險並提升中長期回報，金管局以審慎及漸進的方式分散部分外匯基金的投資至更廣大的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股權、私募股權（包括基礎設施）和房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股權投資受制於投資組合，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。金管局自其成立以來，已訂下上限1以指引分散至LTGP的步伐。隨著LTGP在投資規模和資產多樣性方面日趨成熟，於2022年1月，金管局決定以與其他資產類別同時制定的目標資產配置代替上限，並遵守審慎的風險管理原則。\n\n策略投資組合於2007年設立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的策略目的而購得。由於其獨特性質，策略投資組合並未納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n根據時間，外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與IP2的表現有關，主要個別例子是未來基金3，其利率與IP和長期增值基金的收益率根據投資組合比例掛鈎。 2021年，未來基金在IP和長期增值基金之間的投資組合比例約為40：60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n投資交易所基金的過程以兩種資產配置決策為支撐：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑑於交易所基金的投資目標而制定的長期資產配置。指引著策略性配置，資產被戰術性配置以爭取超過基準的超額回報。這方式意味著實際配置往往不同於基準（或策略性）配置。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準和循跡誤差限制由財政司長諮詢金融管理局諮詢委員會後制定，但戰術決策和容許的戰術偏離範圍則由金管局在轉授權力下作出並建立。對內而言，在容許的戰術偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可能採取倉位以推行短期市場變動的獲利機會（圖示 2）。\n\n圖示 2 交易所基金資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的交換基金投資事務處彙集了其投資及相關風險管理職能。交換基金投資事務處的員工直接管理交換基金約71%的投資，包括全部的BP及其中一章的IP。IP的這一部分包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及各種衍生的覆蓋投資組合，實施為基金進行宏觀風險管理的策略。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n此外管理內部資產，香港金融管理局僱用外部基金經理管理約29%的交換基金資產，包括其所有上市股權投資組合和其他特別資產類別。 參與外部經理的目的在於挖掘市場上可獲得的最佳投資專業知識，獲取可持續的回報，汲取多元且互補的投資方式，並獲得市場見解和技術專業知識。\n\n與外部經理人使用有關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本以及預扣和其他稅款。此支出主要由市場因素制定，並且可能不同於每年。\n\n# 風險管理與合規性\n\n投資環境的複雜性越來越增加，突顯了風險管理的重要性。金管局組嚴格的控制和投資指引，適用於內部和外部管理的投資組合，並確保嚴謹的風險監察和合規系統得以推行。為有效實施風險管理和投資相關活動的治理，已推行三道防線。主要風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及營運風險）會定期監察，而風險管理過程提供良好框架以支持策略規劃和投資多元化。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局認為，透過設立對責任投資和可持續長遠經濟表現的合適重視，可以更好爭取交易所基金的投資目標，並減低與其相關投資的環境、社會和管治（ESG）相關事宜所帶來的風險。香港金融管理局支持責任投資，透過將ESG因素併入交易所基金的公開及私人市場投資流程，並以「一般而言，若長期風險調整回報與其他投資相若，則會優先考慮ESG投資」這個指導原則作為支撐。如欲了解香港金融管理局責任投資框架和實施的更多詳情，請見第184頁至191頁的《可持續發展》章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2021 年的金融市場\n\n全球股市上升急，在超寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施下衝擊新紀錄高位，推動全球經濟和金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港和中國內地股市在改革隨着市場中遜色。美國標準普爾500指數上升了27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌了14%。\n\n對於債券市場而言，上升的通貨膨脹預期以及美國聯準會（Fed）縮減資產購置，導致2021年美國國債收益率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率從年初的0.9%上升至年底的1.5%。\n\n在貨幣市場中，美國美元在2021年底尤其對主要貨幣轉強，在對聯準會縮減步伐的預期影響下。特別是，歐元和日圓分別對美國美元貶值了7.1%和10.3%。\n\n2021年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現，在表 1 中展現。\n\n# 匯風盈餘基金的表現\n\n貨幣儲備基金於2021年錄得投資收益港元1,919十億。這包括債券收益港元126十億，權益淨收益港元478十億（其中海外權益收益港元688億，香港權益虧損港元21十億），以港元計值非港元資產的正貨幣轉換效應港元168億，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益港元1,147十億。此外，策略投資組合錄得估值收益港元31億。\n\n於年底，交易所基金的總資產達到港元45,702十億。長期投資策略的投資市值總值為5,153港元十億，其中私募股權總值3,925港元十億，房地產為1,228港元十億。長期投資策略的未償投資承諾總值2,257港元十億。\n\n於2021年，交易所基金的投資回報率，不包括策略投資組合，為4.1%。具體而言，投資組合（IP）達致3.7%的回報率，而債券投資組合（BP）錄得0.4%的回報。自2009年成立以來，長期投資政府基金（LTGP）的年化內部收益率已錄得15.4%。\n\n香港交換基金自1994年至2021年的年度回報載於圖1。表2顯示2021年的投資回報以及基金在若干不同時段內的平均投資回報。2019年至2021年的平均回報為5.3%，2017年至2021年的平均回報為4.7%，2012至2021年的平均回報為3.3%，自1994年以來的平均回報為4.8%。表3顯示基金於12月31日2021年的貨幣組合。\n\n請參閱第211至319頁的香港交換基金2021年度經審核財務報表。\n"}

A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"developing":["發展"],"function":["職能"],"particular":["特別"],"9.6":["960"],"strong":["強"],"27":["27"],"highly":["高度"],"students":["學生"],"seize":["把握"],"use":["使用"],"co-ordinates":["統籌"],"safeguard":["保障"],"second":["第二"],"launch":["推出"],"’":[""],"maintain":["維持"],"relate":["有關"],"dedicated":["致力於"],"face":["面對"],"talk":["介紹"],"enhance":["提升"],"lingering":["持續的"],"recommendations":["建議"],"built":["建立"],"42":["42"],"maintaining":["維持"],"areas":["範疇"],"flexible":["靈活"],"serving":["服務"],"comprises":["包括"],"grow":["增長"],"began":["開始"],"sharp":["顯著"],"turn":["轉變"],"allowing":["讓"],"2017":["2017"],"participating":["參與"],"well":["良好"],"strengthening":["加強"],"aspects":["方面"],"outbreak":["爆發"],"adhere":["恪守"],"knowledge":["知識"],"based":["以⋯⋯為基礎"],"billion":["十億"],"track":["軌道"],"end":["年底"],"rougher":["崎嶇"],"get":["變得"],"lent":["提供"],"substantial":["大量"],"payment-related":["用作支付用途的"],"Looking":["展望"],"191.9":["1,919"],"December":["12月"],"mean":["意思是"],"mobilising":["引導"],"base":["基礎"],"brought":["帶來"],"need":["需要"],"Subsequently":["其後"],"Finally":["最後"],"seeking":["尋求"],"rollout":["推出"],"governments":["政府"],"mainly":["主要"],"double-digit":["雙位數"],"reduction":["減少"],"continue":["繼續"],"cement":["鞏固"],"entered":["踏入"],"demonstrated":["顯示"],"volatile":["波動"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"providing":["提供"],"benefitting":["受惠"],"also":["亦"],"capture":["把握"],"premature":["過早"],"adding":["加上"],"tough":["艱難"],"committed":["致力"],"faring":["表現"],"aspires":["旨在"],"status":["地位"],"managing":["管理"],"parts":["部分"],"better":["更好"],"first":["首個"],"recovery":["復甦"],"equivalent":["等值"],"namely":["即"],"deteriorated":["惡化"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"4.1":["4.1"],"invite":["邀請"],"Despite":["儘管"],"severe":["嚴重"],"discussion":["討論"],"must":["必須"],"relevant":["相關"],"Meanwhile":["另一方面"],"successful":["成功"],"goes":["有云"],"marks":["標誌"],"increased":["上升"],"see":["見到"],"2050":["2050"],"solid":["穩健"],"past":["過去"],"together":["一同"],"real-time":["即時"],"formulated":["制定"],"pleased":["高興"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"Although":["儘管"],"90":["九成"],"effectively":["有效"],"maintained":["維持"],"ready":["準備就緒"],"vibrancy":["活力"],"years":["年"],"contraction":["收縮"],"point":["指出"],"may":["可能"],"changed":["改變"],"intensification":["升溫"],"prudently":["審慎"],"RMB26":["260億元人民幣"],"traded":["成交"],"increase":["上升"],"tap":["挖掘"],"two":["兩"],"year":["年"],"introduced":["推出"],"recover":["恢復"],"aligning":["呼應"],"groom":["培育"],"151.9":["151.9"],"journey":["旅程"],"future":["未來"],"adopting":["採納"],"set":["建立"],"continued":["繼續"],"increasingly":["日益"],"practical":["實用"],"go":["進行"],"pace":["步伐"],"launched":["推出"],"activity":["活動"],"emergence":["出現"],"extended":["延長"],"published":["發出"],"months":["個月"],"dominant":["主導"],"meeting":["滿足"],"established":["設立"],"throughout":["全"],"enhancing":["增強"],"Tackling":["處理"],"tCO2e\/US":["tCO2e"],"formulate":["制定"],"watch":["留意"],"series":["連串"],"strengthen":["加強"],"achieved":["達致"],"grew":["增長"],"promote":["推動"],"always":["一如既往"],"establishment":["設立"],"hard-pressed":["經營環境艱難"],"pressure":["壓力"],"five":["五"],"require":["需要"],"manage":["管理"],"87":["87%"],"enter":["進入"],"recorded":["錄得"],"revised":["修訂"],"power":["力量"],"cover":["涵蓋"],"trials":["測試"],"facilitate":["促進"],"closely":["緊密"],"concurrent":["同時"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"share":["分享"],"time":["時"],"tackle":["應對"],"guidance":["指引"],"degree":["程度"],"colleagues":["同事"],"reaching":["達到"],"quote":["舉例"],"diversifying":["多元化"],"50":["50"],"across":["橫跨"],"number":["數目"],"15.4":["15.4"],"covering":["涵蓋"],"cash-flow":["資金周轉"],"path":["路徑"],"resources":["資源"],"invest":["投資"],"organisation":["機構"],"outside":["境外"],"leveraging":["利用"],"twice":["兩度"],"six":["6"],"Besides":["此外"],"million":["百萬"],"numerous":["無數"],"completing":["完善"],"timely":["及時"],"capitalise":["把握"],"reaffirming":["重申"],"supporting":["支持"],"taking":["採取"],"feedback":["回饋"],"latter":["後者"],"ever":["曾"],"appropriate":["合適"],"fourfold":["四倍"],"facing":["面對"],"ultimately":["最終"],"comprehensively":["全面"],"kinds":["類"],"us":["我們"],"overnight":["一朝一夕"],"reflecting":["反映"],"reached":["達到"],"principle":["原則"],"testament":["見證"],"essentially":["本質上"],"including":["包括"],"developmental":["發展的"],"develop":["制訂"],"joined":["攜手"],"achievements":["成果"],"room":["空間"],"levels":["層面"],"help":["協助"],"vision":["願景"],"robustness":["穩健"],"recognising":["鑑於"],"quarter":["季度"],"proactive":["主動"],"city":["城市"],"helping":["幫助"],"assured":["保障"],"cycle":["循環"],"1983":["1983"],"128":["128"],"arising":["產生"],"adopt":["應用"],"huge":["巨大"],"milestone":["里程碑"],"worse":["惡化"],"prospect":["前景"],"spectrum":["範疇"],"disclose":["披露"],"grown":["發展"],"resurgence":["反彈"],"purchasing":["購買力"],"virtuous":["生生不息"],"footing":["基礎"],"start":["開始"],"still":["仍"],"connect":["聯繫"],"offers":["提供"],"ensure":["確保"],"fact":["事實"],"conviction":["信心"],"forefront":["領先"],"leveraged":["借助"],"attract":["吸引"],"jurisdiction":["地區"],"Enhancing":["提升"],"position":["地位"],"rise":["上升"],"totalling":["總額達"],"underpinned":["支撐"],"crucial":["至關重要"],"jointly":["聯同"],"generated

財務披露\n\n為維持高水平的透明度，香港金融管理局採納適用於中央銀行運作的國際財務披露標準。這些包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特殊數據發布標準。財務部門與外部審計師和其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務報告準則準備及呈現外匯基金的財務報表。香港金融管理局亦提供詳細的披露和對廣泛支出項目及預算信息的深入分析，載於其年度報告中。\n\n# 問責性與控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要的一項工作是管理貨幣和銀行系統的風險。風險管理既在日常運作中的實務層面推行，也在高層次策略規劃中推行。在香港金融管理局的風險管理框架下，設有兩個高層次委員會—宏觀監控委員會和風險委員會—兩者均由香港金融管理局行政總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監控委員會的條款如下：\n\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融系統的潛在風險和威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可行措施；\n- 檢討現行管理貨幣及金融系統風險的措施，以識別可能的缺口，並確保這些措施的充分性；以及\n- 鼓勵跨部門分享相關的宏觀監控信息，鑑於增強香港金融管理局的宏觀監控能力。\n\n風險委員會的條款如下：\n\n- 識別對機構的潛力風險和威脅，並制定策略以減低這些活動的影響；\n- 檢討現有風險管理的系統橫跨不同部門，以識別可能的缺口和重大風險，並確保措施的充分性以應對它們；\n- 調和風險測量標準和方法，並優先管理識別的風險資源；以及\n- 鼓勵一個更強大的風險管理文化於機構內，推動嚴謹的授權和控制層面。\n\n良好的營運風險管理框架已推行，涵蓋兩個層面的機構風險：實體層面和部門層面。實體層面的風險主要指那些涉及整個機構中長期，或可能通知跨部門因應的風險。業務單位識別的潛力及新興風險，以及他們制定之控制措施和緩解策略的充分性，會每季度報告及審查。此舉輔以由上而下的方法來管理實體層面的風險，其中高層同事帶領不同業務單位積極識別具有廣大影響的風險，並提出緩解措施。風險委員會討論這些評估，並決定合適的跟進行動。\n"}
{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot

永續性\n\n香港金融管理局現正發佈其首個可持續發展報告，作為其2021年年報其中一章，以闡述其可持續發展策略，並記錄其自身努力，以及與金融業界共同努力，支持政府氣候策略，並貢獻於更具氣候適應力及可持續發展的世界。\n\n香港金融管理局將可持續發展的考慮融入其主要角色和職能之中，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，還是維持金融和貨幣穩定。此外，香港金融管理局與本地和海外同行合作，加強氣候風險的管理和披露，以及綠色和可持續金融市場的發展。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局致力履行其企業社會責任，目標是成為一個負責任且可持續發展的機構。這項承諾體現在各種範疇，包括推動一個可持續、金融普及且環保的市場，支持廣大社區，保護環境和營造一個關愛的工作空間。\n\n# 簡介\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面對的最大挑戰之一。為了應對氣候變化，各國在《巴黎協定》下同意推行行動以減少溫室氣體排放，並最終在本世紀內爭取實現碳中和。滿足《巴黎協定》的氣候變化目標需要全球每年估計投入一到二萬億美元，使可持續性成為未來數十年資本流動的最大推動力。\n\n香港致力於成為此轉型過程的領先地區。政府公布將會爭取在2050年前達成碳中和，以呼應全球發達經濟體。香港亦是首個亞洲地區，承諾將具體地使披露要求與氣候相關財務信息披露工作專責組（TCFD）的建議相符，橫跨相關行業，並於2025年達成。\n\n對金融界而言，氣候變化既是風險的來源，也是機遇。雖然金融界無法倖免於氣候變化所帶來的威脅，但它在轉型中扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金引導至與減少溫室氣體排放和具備氣候韌性的發展方向一致的活動。\n\n香港金融管理局致力加強香港的金融體系，以支持更環保及更可持續的未來，推動各項行動以支持政府的氣候目標，並作出貢獻於全球議程。為此，香港金融管理局在其履行主要職能和日常運作中，納入可持續發展的考慮因素。\n\n首個，作為銀行監管機構，金管局的目標是加強銀行系統對氣候風險的韌性，並加速銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的努力。為此，金管局已制定一套監管框架，其中載明銀行管理和披露氣候風險的監管要求。2021年亦已順利完成氣候風險壓力測試的試驗，以評估銀行業的韌性。另一方面，金管局持續納入氣候變化因素以監測金融穩定風險。\n\n第二，在市場發展方面，香港金融管理局正聚焦於增強香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的角色，包括大灣區。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，具備良好地位，可將全球投資引導至中國大陸爭取在2030年達至碳排放峰值及在2060年實現碳中和的計劃。香港金融管理局亦透過綠色及可持續金融跨部門督導小組（CASG）3，而香港金融管理局為聯席主席，以建立業界能力，應對數據缺口，並探討本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港是綠色金融方案的領先者，已設立全球首個政府全球中期票據計劃，致力於在政府綠色債券計劃下發行綠色債券，並自2019年以來逐步擴大其發行的貨幣和期限的多樣性。為支持私營部門發行綠色和可持續債券及貸款，政府於2021年5月建立綠色及可持續融資補助計劃。此計劃由香港金融管理局管理，已激勵更多企業尋求在香港的綠色和可持續融資，並鼓勵更多綠色顧問和外部審閱人在此設立或擴大他們的業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金的經理，金管局確保環境、社會和管治（ESG）因素是其投資流程和資產配置決策其中一章。在本報告的後者部分，金管局作出其首份有關外匯基金投資組合的氣候情景分析和碳足跡指標的披露。\n\n第四，金管局正積極提升自身的綠色辦公室措施，以確保其營運符合氣候風險管理和減緩方面的最佳實踐。作為開始，金管局已設立橫跨第一級和第二級排放範圍的碳排放量概況，並作出相關披露。與此同時，金管局已實施措施以提升全行業的營運效率，並盡量減少資源消耗。此外，金管局對自身的企業社會責任（CSR）設定高標準，並與持份者合作推動金融普及和金融理財知識。\n\n綠色金融體系需要接近中央銀行與監管機構之間的緊密合作。金管局是國際社群中積極的成員，參與全球政策制定及可持續發展標準的協調。金管局亦發布聲明支持中央銀行與監管機構綠色金融體系網絡（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言⁵，重申其落實NGFS建議的承諾，並採取必要措施促進更綠色的金融體系。\n\n在推動這些可持續發展倡議和評估氣候相關的機會和風險時，可持續發展和綠色考量已融入香港金融管理局的管治和風險管理框架，其中領導層積極參與設定整體目標和指導原則，並與外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其各子委員會進行諮詢。香港金融管理局的機構社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦會評估可持續發展和氣候相關議題對機構的潛力影響，並制定策略以減低這些影響。相關策略和倡議的執行情況會緊密監察，並定期報告給高級管理層。此外，已聘請外部顧問為香港金融管理局在選定的範疇提供意見。\n\n本章後續章節將深入探討香港金融管理局在進行綠色金融和可持續發展工作時，於其各個角色中的管治、策略和風險管理措施。\n\n本報告乃參考金融穩定論壇（NGFS）於12月2021年發出之《氣候相關披露指引》中建議的披露要素編製而成。此外，香港金融管理局辦公室營運的相關資訊，廣泛參考全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準6以及香港交易所有限公司頒布的ESG報告指引。\n\n# 中央銀行與金融監管機構綠色金融體系網絡\n\n網絡綠色金融工作小組提供一個平台，讓中央銀行和審慎監管機構交流經驗、分享最佳實踐，貢獻於金融部門環境和氣候風險管理的發展，並動員主流金融以支持轉型接近可持續經濟。 其目的是界定和推動在網絡綠色金融工作小組成員對內及境外實施的最佳實踐，並開展或委託對綠色金融的分析研究。\n\n# 氣候相關財務資訊披露專案組\n\n於12月2015年，金融穩定委員會制訂了TCFD，以制定更有效的氣候相關披露建議，供公司向投資者、貸款人及保險承保人參考，能推動更認識的決策。 TCFD的建議以四個主題範疇為結構，代表組織營運的核心要素：管治、策略、風險管理，以及指標與目標。\n\n# 銀行監察員\n\n作為金融體系的核心其中一章，銀行應主動管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資本引導至綠色和可持續活動。作為銀行監管機構，金管局專注於建立銀行對抗氣候風險的韌性，並加快銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的努力。\n\n# 香港金融管理局的三階段策略簡介\n\n自2019年5月以來，香港金融管理局已分三個階段推動綠色和可持續銀行業：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n發展一個常見的框架以評估個別銀行的「綠色基準」，並與國際組織合作提供技術支援給香港的銀行。\n\n# （ii）階段\n\n諮詢業界及其他持份者，以了解綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望和要求。\n\n# （iii）階段\n\n聚焦於監管要求的落實，以及對銀行在綠色及永續銀行業務進展的監控與評估。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n2020年，香港金融管理局與業界合作，發展了一套常見的框架，以評估個別銀行的「綠色基準」。香港金融管理局亦進行了首個銀行綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行準備新的監管要求，一份白皮書於6月2020年發出，闡釋了香港金融管理局對氣候風險管理的初步監管期望。\n\n於2021年12月，在業界諮詢後，香港金融管理局發出了銀行將氣候考量納入公司治理、策略、風險管理及披露的監管要求。 特別是，在2025年前強制根據TCFD的建議進行氣候相關披露，並確立了具體的時間表。 這些要求將建立一個基準，以協助銀行提升其風險管理能力。\n\n下一步是金管局監察銀行執行相關規定。在這方面，金管局已加強其監察能力，透過在其銀行監理部設立一個新成立的致力於氣候風險監察的團隊。\n\n這個分三階段的方法是一個反覆且反覆的過程。繼2020年進行的首次輪的綠色評估後，香港金融管理局正在檢視框架，以涵蓋新氣候風險管理的監管要求，並有可能涵蓋廣大範圍，例如其他環境風險以及支持淨零轉型的措施。香港金融管理局計劃在2022年第二半推出更新的框架。\n\n# 良好做法支持邁向碳中和的轉型\n\n除了融入氣候風險考量至風險管理框架，部分銀行已致力資源並採取措施支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並貢獻於爭取全球淨零排放。 金管局於12月2021年發出通告，與業界分享這些銀行的良好做法，這些做法會對業界其他銀行在制定氣候策略時具有參考價值。 這些良好做法歸納為四個範疇：減少銀行自身營運的溫室氣體排放、透過投資組合調整減少融資排放、協助客戶過渡，以及推動集體努力協助經濟體爭取淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融流量\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度並促使在綠色金融方面制定貫一致的政策，金管局一直與其他金融監管機構合作探討本地綠色分類框架，這將促進在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）8所開發的共通基礎分類法（CGT）和中國及歐盟採用的綠色定義之間導航，以便在不同金融行業採用。這項工作將以互操作性、可比性和包容性的原則指引，並考慮其他綠色定義、過渡活動和本地考量。此舉將減低漂綠風險，優化產品可比性，並最終提升投資者保護。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業面對氣候變化所帶來的潛在衝擊的能力，香港金融管理局展開了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）的試驗，包括20家主要零售銀行和7家國際銀行分行參與。一份總結試驗CRST結果的報告於12月2021年發出。結果顯示，即使面對極端氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍然具有韌性，儘管這些衝擊有可能導致銀行財務產生重大的負面影響。CRST試驗有助於提升銀行衡量和評估氣候風險的能力。鑑於CRST的結果，參與銀行已制定計劃以加強其氣候策略和風險管治框架。香港金融管理局將繼續保持聯繫，加強銀行的能力並提升CRST框架，並採取從試驗中汲取的經驗教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

匯豐基金\n\n審計署署長報告 結匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署 香港特殊行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財務司\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審核了外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）於第217至319頁所載的財務報表，其中包括外匯基金及本集團於2021年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該年12月31日止年度的收益及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策的概要。\n\n根據我的意見，財務報表妥為地提供了截至12月31年2021年，基金及集團的財務地位的真實及公平的鑑於，以及彼等當年已截至的財務表現和現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）作出，且已根據交換基金條例（第66章）第7部分行政長官的指示妥為編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我進行審計，根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所作的指示，以及審計署的審計準則。我在該準則下的責任，於我的報告中「財務報表審計部分」中進一步描述。我根據該等準則，獨立於本集團，並且已履行我的其他專業道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據是足夠及合適的，以提供我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為那些在我專業判斷下，於截至12月31年2021年的財務報表審計中，最為重要的事項。 這些事項已在對整體財務報表審計的背景下加以處理，並在形成我對此的意見時加以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 金融資產與金融負債以公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n於2021年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總額達港元4,502,475百萬，金融負債總額達港元1,150,861百萬，並按公允價值估值。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 89% 及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價 (第一層級輸入)，或以觀測到的市場數據為基礎的估值技術估計 (第二層級輸入)。\n\n對於餘下11%的這些金融資產，其公允價值是用以估計的估值技術，其輸入數據並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級輸入數據）。 這些金融資產總值為港元5,173.16百萬，包括主要為未上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於大量的金額以及所涉及的估計，以公允價值評估金融資產和金融負債是關鍵審計事項。\n\n對金融資產及金融負債公允價值估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得對評估不同類別的金融資產和金融負債程序的理解，包括相關的控制；\n評估和測試這些控制，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n取得外部函證以確認金融資產和金融負債的估值、存在、權利和義務以及完整性；\n當運用了報價市場價格時，將價格核對至獨立資料來源；\n當運用了以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性以及假設的合理性，並將輸入數據核對至獨立資料來源；以及\n當運用了未以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性以及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業以公允價值估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n本集團的投資物業以其公允價值列帳，於2021年12月31日總額達港元27,089百萬。本集團亦持有 一 間聯營公司及二十一間合營公司，總額達港元45,172百萬，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由本集團直接持有，還是由聯營公司或合營公司持有，主要制定以獨立專業估值師的估值為基礎。 該等估值涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所運用的假設。\n\n對投資物業以公允價值估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及檢視本集團直接或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值是以估值報告中列帳的估值為基礎；\n- 評估估價師的獨立性和資格；以及\n- 評估估值方法和假設及輸入的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理局負責其他資訊。其他資訊包括香港貨幣管理局2021年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此表達任何形式的保証結論。\n\n與我審計財務報表有關的，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識有重大不符，或以其他方式看來有重大錯誤陳述。如果，以我所執行工作的基礎上，我得出結論認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我便所需報告該事實。我在此方面沒有任何報告。\n\n# 貨幣管理機關及結匯基金諮詢委員會審計委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n根據香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7部分所作出的行政長官指示，貨幣管理局負責編製真實公允地提供財務報表，並為此確定必要的內部控制，以確保財務報表沒有因欺詐或錯誤而產生重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在準備財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團繼續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，用以持續經營會計基準。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確定財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯誤，無論該錯誤是部分由於舞弊還是錯誤造成，並發行一份審計師報告，其中包括我的意見。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並不能保證按照審計委員會審計準則進行的審計能偵測到存在的重大錯誤。錯誤可能源於舞弊或錯誤，如果這些錯誤單獨或總體而言，可能合理預期會影響依賴這些財務報表而做出的經濟決策，則會被探討為重大錯誤。\n\n作為審計署審計準則的其中一章審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並全過程維持懷疑態度。 亦：\n\n識別並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，設計和執行對這些風險做出回應的審計程序，並獲取足夠且合適的審計證據，以作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、不實陳述或覆蓋內部控制，因此由於欺詐導致的重大錯誤陳述未被發現的風險高於由於錯誤導致的風險；\n- 為了設計在具體情況下合適的審計程序，而了解與審計相關的內部控制，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估所使用的會計政策的合適性以及貨幣當局作出的會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局使用持續經營會計基礎的合適性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，評估是否存在與可能對本集團繼續作為持續經營能力產生重大疑慮的活動或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我需要在我審計師報告中提醒注意財務報表中的相關披露，或者，如果這些披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論以截至我審計師報告日期的審計證據為基礎。然而，未來活動或情況可能導致本集團停止持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈現方式、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允表達的方式反映了基礎交易和活動；以及\n- 獲取關於本集團內實體或業務活動的財務信息的足夠合適的審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的方向、監督和執行。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我與交易所基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重要的審計結果溝通，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何內部控制的重大缺失。\n\n我亦提供予交易所基金諮詢委員會轄下審計委員會一份聲明，證明我已遵守就獨立性而言的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能被合理地認為會產生影響於我的獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n從與證券基金諮詢委員會審計委員會的聯繫事項中，我釐定在當前期間的財務報表審計中最重要的事項，因此這些是關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我釐定該事項不應在我的報告中聯繫，因為這樣做的負面後果合理預計會超過此類聯繫的公共利益福利。\n\n朱約翰 審計署署長\n"}
