{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong

總裁聲明\n\n在2017年，全球經濟和金融市場表現得比預期理想：實體經濟見到穩定增長；通貨膨脹仍然平穩；美國聯邦儲備局在該年進行的三次加息和資產負債表縮減並未造成新興市場經濟體的資本外流或美元走強。在牛氣沖天的情緒下，全球股市，包括三項主要的美國股市指數，不斷創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲了34%。香港恆生指數在2017年近錄得8,000點（或36%）的漲幅，並突破30,000點關口，在2018年1月達到歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在如此有利的環境中充滿樂觀，甚至興奮。然而，這情況持續到今年2月，最新數據顯示美國的工資上升高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通貨膨脹風險，並引發全球股市的顯著調整。道瓊斯指數在2月的第二同周內下跌超過1,000點，而香港恆生指數在同一同周內下跌超過3,000點。10年期美國國債收益率一度飆升至2.95%。資金流向的迅速逆轉顯示，市場的紀錄新高估值並未建立在紥實的根基之上。這亦提醒我們，香港應對資產市場波動和資本外流所帶來的挑戰，需要一個穩健且健全的金融系統的重要性。\n\n# 銀行體系彈性因防患未然措施而增強\n\n有云「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局於2017年實施進一步的風險緩解措施，以保障香港銀行及金融體系的穩定。於5月，我們推出第八輪針對銀行按揭貸款的逆周期措施，並加強銀行對地產商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在加強銀行體系對來自房地產市場任何逆轉所產生的衝擊的抵禦能力。經過多個輪的措施，新的住宅按揭貸款平均貸款價值比率由2009年9月的64%下降至2017年底的49%，而平均債務收入比率亦下降至35%，較2010年8月的41%為低。\n\n2017年，我們設立了決議辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被認為「大到不能倒」的不可行的金融機構。這將幫助避免重蹈2008年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時動用了公共資金來拯救陷入困境的金融機構，並減低它們結業對金融體系、經濟及社會大眾的影響。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩定及可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率和資本充足率均遠高於適用的法定要求，位居全球前列。這顯示香港銀行體系具有強大的韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款增加16%，而資產質量亦保持穩定。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2016年的0.72%跌至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。銀行業整體股本回報率（根據稅前經營利潤計算）在2017年達11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心而言，處於非常健康的水平。\n\n# 穩健的銀行業是長期財務穩定的關鍵。\n\n2008年全球金融危機暴露了單憑規則和條例制約金融業追求盈利，而未有顧及其主要責任的局限。情況下，金管局在近期加強推廣「穩健銀行」實務，鼓勵銀行發展及追求好企業文化和價值觀。特別是，為了解決銀行員工追求短期利益，以犧牲顧客或銀行的長期利益這個發行，我們鼓勵銀行將適當的激勵機制建立起來，使其與其企業文化和價值觀一致。作為這項計劃的部分，我們安排了首屆獨立非執行董事（INED）年度會議於2017年3月舉行，以突顯樹立良好銀行文化的重要性，並幫助INEDs更有效地發揮其監督和監控角色。\n\n經銀行業界的支持，2017年是金管局在推動金融普惠方面一個成功 的年。6間銀行實體分行和三間流動分行開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與八達通及便利店連鎖店合作，推出一個先導計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的便利店提款，而未有購買的需要。香港郵政亦於今年開展在七間郵局為長者提供提款服務，主要位於離島和新界地區。在…方面，金管局去年設立了一個專頁和一個電子郵件賬戶，並安排專責團隊跟進公眾有關開立銀行賬戶的查詢或投訴。多方持份者的努力，讓客戶在開立個人及公司銀行賬戶的經驗得到顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來變革。\n\n在新紀元快速的科技推動下，金融科技已逐步融入我們的生活。在瞬息萬變的科技環境中，銀行必須把握新的發展，並追求在金融科技應用上的創新。隨著智慧銀行的新紀元到來，香港金融管理局於9月推出七項舉措（詳見106頁），以推動銀行採用金融科技，從而加強銀行產品和服務的質素，為顧客帶來裨益。雖然這些舉措彼此獨立，但它們是互補的，並將為香港支付和銀行服務的未來生態帶來重大轉變。顧客不僅能享用更方便、快捷和安全的支付和銀行服務，亦將擁有更多選擇和更大程度地控制其財務交易。金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁進智慧銀行的新紀元將為銀行升級和轉型帶來一機會。\n\n# 龐大機遇由「一帶一路」和灣區倡議締造。\n\n鑑於國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，多元化金融產業對香港而言至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局加強提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。香港位居前列的優勢在於「背靠內地，維持國際前景」，「一帶一路」倡議和粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）的發展將帶來龐大機遇給金融和銀行業，並為香港的經濟增長帶來新的動力。為呼應「一帶一路」倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自推出以來，夥伴數字已增至約90個，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資的融資中心打下紥實的根基。中國開發銀行於2017年在香港發行首隻「一帶一路」債券，突顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面可以發揮樞紐地位。\n\n此外在基礎設施融資之外，我們積極參與香港作為企業資金中心、私募股權基金和亞洲衍生工具業務樞紐的發展，透過吸引跨國企業和主要金融機構來管理他們的資金、資產和城市內各種金融風險。 這些舉措將進一步鞏固和升級香港的金融及相關專業服務範疇。香港金融管理局亦維持與肩負大灣區發展責任的有關當局緊密溝通，以鞏固合作，從而為該範疇作為世界級城市群體的金融發展做出貢獻。\n\n多年來，香港金融業在「善用香港優勢，所需滿足國家」的主軸下發展。隨著2014年滬港通的推出、2016年深港通的推出，以及去年7月的「債券通」北向交易，透過香港金融平台連接內地與全球的市場互聯互通已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯了香港作為全球投資者進入內地金融市場的獨特地位。2017年，香港維持其作為離岸人民幣業務領先全球中心的地位。人民幣即時大額結算系統的平均每日成交額高達9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計數據，當年超過70%的全球人民幣支付交易均由香港處理。離岸人民幣市場繼續有序運作並穩步發展。\n\n# 培育人才以鞏固銀行業的實力。\n\n鑑於金融業持續成長，培育人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局注重銀行業的軟實力，我們亦一直鼓勵和支持銀行從業員的持續能力建設。繼推出反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資和網絡安全兩項專業資歷後，去年我們擴展了其覆蓋範圍，包括零售財富管理和資金管理，以提升銀行從業員透過持續專業發展的核心能力水平。香港金融管理局亦致力培育年青銀行業人才。於2017年，我們與業界合作推出私人財富管理學徒計劃和金融科技人才加速計劃。鑑於壓倒性的呼應，這些計劃的覆蓋範圍將在未來進一步擴展。\n\n# 審慎的投資策略取得合理的長期平穩回報\n\n背靠強勁的全球經濟增長，交易所基金去年錄得新高投資收入2,640億香港元，各方面均有回報，包括股權、債券和外匯。整體投資回報為7.4%。投資組合的投資回報率為12.1%，而後盾組合則錄得1.8%。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）自2009年成立以來的年化內部收益率達至13.7%。儘管去年的投資表現佳績，但日益複雜的投資環境需要香港金融管理局繼續管理交易所基金。我們將維持機動，密切監察市場發展，並在適當的時候部署防禦措施。LTGP下的投資亦將進一步擴展。一向以來，在可控的風險水平內，管理香港市民財富時，將秉承「首要保本，長期增長之後」的投資原則。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續去年 的升勢，但 2018年仍潛藏著不明朗因素和風險。這些包括美國利率加快 加息 的步伐，一旦通貨膨脹加劇，以及貿易摩擦升級和地緣政治生態惡化。如果這些下行風險觸發，將對全球金融市場產生顯著和廣泛 的影響，並對香港 的資金流動、資產價格和實體經濟產生連鎖影響。因此，我們應該謹慎管理風險。\n\n在未來幾個月，相信香港元息差走勢將會維持在焦點。美國聯邦儲備局自2015年12月以來已提升利率6次。隨著香港元利率與其美元對應的息差擴闊，資金從香港元流向美元的誘因將會更大。香港元近期受到走弱壓力，而7.85弱方兌換承諾已觸發。正如我們多次強調，當7.85弱方兌換承諾觸發時，香港金管局將會作為「超級換匯商」透過購買香港元和在市場上出售美元，以保證香港元匯率不會走弱至7.85水平以下。這些操作是正常的，並按照聯匯制度的設計進行。這不應引起任何憂慮。事實上，外匯基金現時持有超過4兆美元的資產，其中香港元貨幣基礎數額約為1,700億美元，為資金外流事件提供強大的緩衝。多年來，香港金管局已建立多個防線，以保障銀行和金融體系的穩定。從正面來看，資金外流將導致香港元利率逐步上升，這將有助於香港利率環境的正常化，因而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，香港金管局將嚴陣以待，並讓每 次都盡最大努力保持香港的貨幣和銀行穩定。\n"}

Nevertheless, the public remains highly confident in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe money markets continue to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"city":["城市"],"end":["年底"],"people":["市民"],"built":["建立"],"expanded":["擴展"],"achieving":["取得"],"continuing":["持續"],"pursue":["追求"],"us":["我們"],"saw":["見到"],"abound":["潛藏"],"record":["紀錄"],"remained":["仍然"],"since":["自"],"HK":["香港"],"49":["49%"],"launch":["推出"],"first":["首"],"adoption":["採用"],"webpage":["專頁"],"year":["年"],"increasing":["增加"],"facilitating":["促進"],"billion":["億"],"’":["的"],"lives":["生活"],"great":["重大"],"marks":["適逢"],"competence":["能力"],"developments":["發展"],"reversal":["逆轉"],"indicated":["顯示"],"Thanks":["經"],"brought":["帶來"],"secure":["安全"],"introduction":["推出"],"classified":["不良"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"developers":["地產商"],"2014":["2014年"],"transform":["轉型"],"developing":["開展"],"widening":["擴闊"],"strengthen":["鞏固"],"operate":["運作"],"campaign":["計劃"],"upgrade":["升級"],"maintained":["維持"],"technological":["科技"],"hence":["因而"],"2008":["2008年"],"highlight":["突顯"],"era":["新紀元"],"among":["位居…前列"],"role":["地位"],"41":["41%"],"weathered":["克服"],"addition":["此外"],"fell":["跌"],"pursuing":["追求"],"enhancing":["加強"],"coming":["未來"],"launched":["推出"],"times":["次"],"stepped":["加強"],"efforts":["努力"],"February":["2月"],"1.8":["1.8%"],"concerted":["多方"],"established":["設立"],"11.74":["11.74%"],"together":["一同"],"ensure":["保證"],"result":["造成"],"weaken":["走弱"],"responsibilities":["責任"],"play":["發揮"],"modules":["專業資歷"],"RMB900":["9,000億元人民幣"],"2010":["2010年"],"practitioners":["從業員"],"second":["第二"],"involved":["參與"],"closures":["結業"],"integrated":["融入"],"implement":["落實"],"moving":["邁進"],"make":["讓"],"give":["帶來"],"part":["部分"],"convenient":["方便"],"case":["一旦"],"dropped":["下跌"],"also":["亦"],"gained":["錄得"],"May":["5月"],"always":["一向"],"vigilant":["嚴陣以待"],"created":["締造"],"undoubtedly":["顯示"],"light":["情況下"],"round":["輪"],"needs":["所需"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"sustainable":["可持續"],"competition":["競爭"],"2.2":["2.2%"],"increase":["上升"],"7.85":["7.85"],"foundation":["根基"],"accounts":["賬戶"],"revealed":["暴露"],"quarter":["四分之一"],"smoothly":["有序"],"maintain":["保持"],"perform":["發揮"],"recurrence":["重蹈"],"week":["同周"],"3,000":["3,000"],"set":["設立"],"dollars":["美元"],"several":["多個"],"last":["去年"],"including":["包括"],"shocks":["衝擊"],"high":["新高"],"pace":["步伐"],"world":["全球"],"within":["內"],"response":["呼應"],"stated":["強調"],"century":["世紀"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"significant":["顯著"],"adhered":["秉承"],"25th":["25周年"],"satisfactory":["佳績"],"changing":["變"],"extending":["延續"],"Given":["鑑於"],"page":["專頁"],"close":["緊密"],"greater":["更大"],"September":["9月"],"ever":["以來"],"held":["舉辦"],"introduced":["推出"],"coverage":["覆蓋"],"need":["需求"],"Six":["6"],"develop":["發展"],"include":["包括"],"triggered":["觸發"],"manage":["管理"],"25":["25"],"restrain":["制約"],"wage":["工資"],"leveraging":["善用"],"eighth":["第八輪"],"improvement":["改善"],"all-time":["歷史"],"consolidate":["鞏固"],"Enormous":["龐大"],"highlighted":["突顯"],"stood":["高達"],"importance":["重要性"],"agile":["機動"],"responsible":["肩負"],"pivotal":["樞紐"],"reached":["達"],"allowing":["讓"],"good":["好"],"independent":["獨立"],"highs":["新高"],"0.72":["0.72%"],"put":["將"],"0.54":["0.54%"],"advantage":["優勢"],"spotlight":["焦點"],"prevent":["避免"],"around":["約"],"dialogue":["溝通"],"used":["動用"],"cure":["治療"],"safeguard":["保障"],"appropriate":["適當"],"months":["月"],"prompting":["促使"],"particular":["特別"],"advancement":["推動"],"providing":["提供"],"highest":["最高"],"saying":["有云"],"without":["未有"],"nimble":["機動"],"store":["便利店"],"achieved":["取得"],"oversight":["監督"],"corrections":["調整"],"implications":["影響"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"effort":["努力"],"meet":["應對"],"maintaining":["維持"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"continued":["繼續"],"position":["地位"],"minimise":["減低"],"35":["35%"],"expense":["損害"],"empower":["幫助"],"worked":["合作"],"years":["年"],"2018":["2018年"],"closely":["密切"],"issuance":["發行"],"establishing":["樹立"],"long":["長期"],"diversified":["多元化"],"underscores":["突顯"],"landscape":["生態"],"healthy":["健康"],"promoting":["推動"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"easily":["不易"],"solid":["紥實"],"ongoing":["持續"],"task":["任務"],"efficient":["快捷"],"recently":["近期"],"gradual":["逐步"],"back":["背靠"],"positive":["正面"],"fail":["倒"],"perspective":["來看"],"106":["106頁"],"laying":["打下"],"advisable":["應該"],"various":["多個"],"innovation":["創新"],"follow":["跟進"],"attaches":["注重"],"widespread":["廣泛"],"Many":["許多"],"downside":["下行"],"relying":["依靠"],"T.L":["T.L."],"hikes":["加息"],"status":["地位"],"264":["2,640億"],"inaugural":["首屆"],"offer":["帶來"],"bullish":["牛氣沖天"],"next":["之後"],"reappraise":["重新評估"],"society":["社會"],"continue":["繼續"],"outlying":["離島"],"taking":["採取"],"roles":["角色"],"strengthened":["加強"],"areas":["地區"],"one":["一"],"nurturing":["培育"],"Indeed":["事實上"],"levels":["水平"],"enhance":["提升"],"worst":["最壞"],"actively":["積極"],"successful":["成功"],"line":["主軸"],"convenience":["便利"],"normal":["正常"],"trillion":["兆"],"deteriorating":["惡化"],"movements":["走勢"],"currently":["現時"],"impetus":["動力"],"pressure":["壓力"],"8,000":["8,000"],"launching":["開展"],"supporting":["支持"],"arranged":["安排"],"gains":["回報"],"Supporting":["支持(組合)"],"1.7":["1,700億"],"reduction":["縮減"],"Regarding":[

摘要 2017\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長加快，背靠全球經濟同步擴張。本地股市上升，住宅房地產市場維持其升勢，而房屋負擔能力收緊。\n\n香港銀行業維持安全且穩健，擁有強勁的資本和流動性狀況以及健康的資產品質。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港元回軟，受到兩種貨幣之間擴闊的負利率息差所造成。然而，公眾維持高度信心於聯匯制度。\n\n資金市場繼續有序運作，銀行體系內有充裕的資金。香港的基準利率上調總共 75 厘，至 1.75厘，因應美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的上升。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金管局將其監管重點放在銀行風險治理框架的有效性上，包括信貸、流動性及科技風險管理。為鞏固銀行業對房地產市場任何逆轉的復原力，推出第八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。\n\n在政策方面，在國際監管標準的本地落實方面取得重大進展。決議機制生效，樹立了銀行體系穩定性的新主軸。決議辦公室是香港金融管理局讓決議機制在香港銀行業運作的努力的其中一部分。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n七項新舉措推出以把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇，並推動香港成為亞洲金融科技中心。經一連串努力在網絡和能力建設方面，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象得到進一步提升。\n\n香港維持其領先地位於離岸人民幣業務。推出「債券通」鞏固了香港作為通往內地機遇的主要門戶的地位。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受惠於有利的投資環境，香港交換基金達到紀錄新高的投資收入2,640億港元，為7.4%的投資回報。\n\n努力在投資多元化方面繼續，特別透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率為13.7%。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳媒、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道，維持與社群和市場的有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策和運作的了解。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續加強企業管治，透過支持員工的專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律，以及加強資訊科技保安來應付來自新措施落實和工作繁重所引起的挑戰。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally

經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟擴張更趨同步的背景下，香港見到2017年經濟增長加快，勞工市場狀況趨緊，通脹壓力保持平穩。預期2018年經濟增長將維持紥實。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在更同步的全球經濟擴張下，香港經濟在2017年增長加快。實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長以及過去10年約3%的長期增長（圖1和表1）。 內需走堅，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出回升。更強勁的內需反映了有利的就業和收入狀況、上漲的資產價格以及改善的商業氣氛。外圍方面，由於全球貿易流量增加，香港商品出口擴展步伐加快，而由於暢旺的貿易和貨運流量以及本地居民入境旅遊提升，服務出口也隨之回升。商品進口錄得更強的增長，受到出口帶動的的需求影響，服務進口在強勁的旅遊興趣下穩步上升。綜合來看，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長產生負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，儘管港元與美元之間的負利率差，主要由利率套利活動推動，香港元兌美元匯率一般回軟。這反映了聯匯制度的正常運作，按照其設計。雖然仍然處於相對低水平，但由於新股相關資金所需和銀行年底流動性狀況，香港元銀行同業拆息在2017年底面對更多升勢壓力。至於信貸增長，在經歷兩年個位數增長後，2017年總銀行貸款上升了顯著加快的16.1%步伐，反映經濟狀況提升和正面金融市場情緒。儘管貸款增長加快，但未見銀行信貸審慎標準放寬的跡象，整體貸款質量仍然好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在整個2017年仍然受到良好控制（圖2）。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響，基本通脹率下降至1,700億，較2016年的2.3%有所下降。特別是，價格指數中的住房組成項目以較慢的步伐上升，反映了2016年新簽訂私人住宅租金增幅放緩的滲透。更大致而言，在強勁產出增長的背景下，名義工資和收入的溫和增加有助於遏抑本地成本壓力。進口價格通脹亦低迷，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹情況一致，儘管美元轉弱。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n勞動力市場在2017年隨著高於趨勢的經濟增長而收緊。經季節性調整的失業率從2016年的3.4% 跌至2017年底的2.9%，創下近20年來的首 次低於3% (圖3)。大多數主要經濟部門各自的失業率回落，其中零售、金融和專業及商業服務行業的降幅尤為明顯。隨著總就業人數增長加快，以及私營部門職位空缺增加，整體勞動力需求繼續鞏固。勞動力亦擴展，部分反映了年齡較大員工（歲55及以上）的參與度提高。與勞動力市場狀況收緊和通脹下限一致，實際工資和收入見到加快增加。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市在2017年經歷了幾乎不間斷的上升。恆生指數上升了36%，是自2010年（圖4）以來的最大年度增長。這波漲勢反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀，並且部分受到來自內地投資者透過滬港通和深港通的重大資金流入的支持。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底仍然處於高水平。平均每日成交額從前一年的669億香港元擴展到883億香港元，而本地市場籌集的整體股本資金亦上升至5814億香港元，較一年前的4901億香港元為高。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在整個年度維持其升勢（圖4）。交易量由一年前的54,701宗增加至61,591宗，而房屋價格在2017年上升了14.8%。房屋負擔能力進一步收緊，樓價與收入比率為16.4，較1997年的次高高位更高，而收入與按揭比率為74.1，遠高於其長期平均水平。1 鑒於房價上升以及銀行間按揭業務的競爭越趨激烈，金管局在5月推出第八輪審慎措施，以鞏固銀行風險管理和保障銀行穩定。在這些措施之後，房屋價格增長短暫放緩，隨後在第四季加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，交易活動在該年顯著增加，交易價值和量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格的回升，相應的租金收益較去年微升。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2018年的經濟增長預期將維持紥實。政府的預測增長幅度為3至4%，而私人界分析師則預測經濟將以平均3.2%的速度擴大。外圍方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受惠於改善的全球經濟前景和逐步復甦的入境旅遊。本地方面，私人消費增長預期將背靠有利的勞動力市場狀況而維持。至於固定資本形成，建築和施工活動應隨著房屋供應上升和持續基礎設施項目而進展。雖然改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升可能會帶來阻力。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n儘管全球通脹仍然溫和，本地成本穩步上升，香港的通脹壓力預計在2018年將維持溫和，但通脹率相信會從2017年的低位逐步回升。例如，由於新簽訂私人住宅租金的帶動，通脹的租金組成項目在2018年下半年可能會增強升勢。市場共識預測2018年的整體通脹率將為仍然溫和的2.2%，而政府預測核心通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、擴大中的建築和建造活動，以及逐步復甦的入境旅遊預計將保持勞動力市場偏緊的未來。私人分析師預測2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%水準。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景在許多不明朗因素和風險的**前提下**，**包括**與主要中央銀行貨幣政策正常化和全球金融市場穩定**相關**的風險，**以及**升溫的保護主義情緒和**惡化**的地緣政治緊張**狀況**。**特別**是，如果這些風險**觸發**資金流向**香港**的**逆轉**，本地貨幣**狀況****可能****加快****收緊**，**構成**對實體經濟和資產價格的下行壓力。\n\n房地產市場的**前景**仍然**不明朗**。在**近期**，**現時****有利**的國內經濟**狀況**、 कथित 房屋短缺、**低**按揭利率以及**其他**房屋融資來源（**包括****地產商**提供的按揭貸款和來自家長的財政支持），**會****繼續**支持物業需求。然而，全球金融市場**近期**的**拋售**可能會**拖累**市場情緒。從**長遠**來看，房地產市場**繼續****面對**多項**阻力**。**特別**是，隨著美國貨幣政策**繼續**正常化，國內按揭利率**最終****會****上升**。**此外**，在政府**努力**增加土地和住宅供應的**背靠**下，預計房屋供需差距**會****逐步****收窄**，這**會****緩和**房價的**上升壓力**。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n儘管全球經濟存在不明朗因素，香港的銀行業於2017年仍然安全且穩健。認可機構的資本和流動性狀況仍然強勁，資產質素維持在健康水平，盈利能力則因息差上升和信貸增長強勁而顯著改善。經。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化繼續，一和三個月的香港銀行同業拆息分別上升了49個基點和39個基點，於2017年。更明顯的上升在第4季被見到。然而，零售銀行以綜合利率反映的香港元資金成本，在該年仍然大致平穩（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n整體零售銀行香港辦事處的稅前經營利潤在2017年增長了15.8%。 改善的表現主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）和手續費收入增加（+9.4%）。然而，這些增加部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下跌（-29.9%）和經營支出增長（+8.4%）所抵銷。 由於2016年錄得的特定非經常性項目，零售銀行的稅後利潤下跌了18.1%。 零售銀行的平均資產稅後回報率從2016年的1.44%下降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨利息差在2017年擴闊至1.45%，較2016年 的1.32% (圖 7) 主要由於市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例下降至40% ，從2016年的44.3%。 手續費和佣金收入上升了9.4%，但外匯及衍生工具業務產生的收入則下跌了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行成本收入比率由2016年的43.2%下降至2017年的41.9%，原因是經營成本（+8.4%）的上升步伐放緩，低於經營收入的增長（+11.8%）（圖8）。零售銀行貸款減損費用從2016年的8億香港元下降至73億香港元。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n零售銀行貸款品質在該年得到改善，不良貸款比率從較早一年的

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial

貨幣穩定\n\n儘管對香港元匯率的壓力減弱，香港元外匯和貨幣市場繼續有序運作，且有充裕的流動性。聯匯制度一直是香港貨幣和金融穩定的強大支柱，並已展現出對多個衝擊的高度強大的承受衝擊能力。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港的貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣的平穩。這被定義為香港貨幣在外匯市場中與美元的匯率以7.75至7.85港幣兌1美元的區間內保持平穩。貨幣制度的特點是以貨幣發行局安排為基礎，要求貨幣基礎至少由儲備基金內持有的美元儲備以100%支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎（表 1）包括：\n- 提供十足擔保給三家發鈔銀行發行的債務憑證\n- 政府發行的紙幣和硬幣的流通\n- 結算餘額總和，即銀行在金管局持有的結算帳戶餘額的整體\n- 金管局代表政府發行的結算基金票據和紙幣。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制以及香港金融管理局的堅決承諾履行港幣兌換基金承諾（CUs）來維持。當香港美元的需求大於供應，且市場匯率轉強至強方兌換基金水平每1美元7.75港幣時，香港金融管理局準備好向銀行沽出香港美元以換取美元。整體結餘隨後會擴大，以壓低香港美元利率，創造貨幣狀況，使香港美元遠離強方限制，回到7.75至7.85的兌換區內。相反地，如果香港美元的供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌弱至弱方兌換基金水平每1美元7.85港幣時，香港金融管理局將向銀行買入香港美元。整體結餘隨後會收縮，以推高香港美元利率，使香港美元遠離弱方限制，並維持在兌換區內。\n\n# 2017 年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n香港港幣匯率於2017年一般見到壓力收窄（圖1）。主要受港幣與美元利率息差擴闊推動，港幣對美元滙率逐步回軟，從1月3日的7.7566，至8月22日的年度低位7.8265。港幣匯率在9月下旬至11月初錄得一些強大，因新股相關資金需求導致港幣流動性收緊，並在7.80至7.81的狹窄範圍內穩定交易。在年底，港幣的壓力再次出現，部分反映港幣流動性狀況微升，以及年底美元商業需求上升。總體而言，香港港幣外匯市場在整個2017年運作正常。\n\n由於沒有觸發CUs，整體餘額與未償還的交換基金票據總額在2017年仍然無大變動，約為香港$1,225.3億（圖2）。在該年，香港金融管理局發行了總額為香港$80億增發的交換基金票據，以應對銀行對流動性管理的上升需求。這導致整體餘額在2017年底減少至香港$179.8億。增發交換基金票據符合聯繫匯率制度原則，因為它僅屬於貨幣基礎的改變，從整體餘額轉移至未償還的交換基金票據。貨幣基礎仍然全面支持外匯儲備。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港元港際銀行利率在2017年的首八個月份仍然偏軟，其後在年底面臨更大的升勢壓力（圖3）。儘管對美國聯邦儲備局的加息和資產負債表正常化存在擔憂，但香港元港際銀行利率在首八個月一般仍然偏軟。因此，香港元與美元利率之間的負息差在1月至8月期間擴闊。從9月起，短期香港元港際銀行利率大幅回升，主要由新股集資活動和年底資金需求推動。與此同時，香港元與美元利率之間的負息差在短期範疇收窄。總體而言，2017年短期港際銀行利率大多在基準利率以下交易。\n\n基準利率於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，總共75個基點，由1.00% 提升至1.75厘，由於美國聯邦基金利率的目標區間於當年上調三次，總共75個基點，由0.50至0.75% 提升至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的修訂公式進行，其中基準利率的設定是直接或間接取美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限之上50個基點，或五天移動平均隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤香港元與美元息差的走勢，香港元遠期點數在首三季逐步擴闊，12個月香港元遠期點數在9月中旬達到約-615點子（圖4）。在第4季，隨著香港元與美元利率負息差的收窄，香港元遠期點數的折扣微升。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續運作於有序的狀態，銀行體系流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗口借款由2016年的53億港元上升至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯匯匯率制度\n\n自從一九八三年設立以來，聯匯制度一直是香港貨幣和金融穩定的強大錨定，並在一連串區域和全球金融危機中展現高度的承受衝擊能力。政府重申對聯匯制度的十足承諾，而其承諾的可信度更因外匯和貨幣市場的穩定而得到加強。公眾對香港元作為支付手段和保值工具的信心亦繼續強。在二零一七年與香港進行的第四條諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織重申對聯匯制度的支持，並評論聯匯制度仍然是香港的最佳匯率安排。聯匯制度合併了穩健的金融監管和規章，審慎的財政管理和靈活的市場，幫助香港成功應對外部和國內挑戰，運作亦。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯匯匯率制度維持是香港的最佳安排。」\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯系匯率制度的正常運作至關重要。於2017年，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察銀行信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理和壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以增強銀行業的韌性。 隨著美國聯邦儲備局繼續回復至正常其貨幣政策，香港元息率亦會逐步回復至正常。香港金融管理局重申，在聯系匯率制度的設計下，資本外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方兌換保證及縮減貨幣基礎是港元息率回復至正常的必要過程的一部分。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾謹慎管理風險，並為潛在的金融動盪做好亦準備。\n\n為加強貨幣單位帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已分配特定部分的交換基金資產背靠貨幣基礎。背靠比率，定義為背靠資產除以貨幣基礎，於2017年內變動於106.7–108.2%的範圍內，未有觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報108.1%（圖5）。根據聯動匯率制度，雖然特定交換基金資產已指定用於背靠投資組合，但所有交換基金資產均不詳用於支持香港元匯率。在發生突發衝擊的情況下，交換基金龐大的財政資源將提供強大的後盾，以保護香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）的匯 exchange Fund Advisory 委員會監察及檢視與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的議題。於2017年，貨幣發行委員會考慮了多個議題，包括香港房價短期動態的驅動因素、HIBOR-倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）息差的決定因素、物業估價變動對內地企業借貸的上調影響，以及按揭債務服務負擔對香港消費的上調影響。貨幣發行委員會的討論紀錄以及提交給貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行運作報告均公布於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n香港金融研究學院（金研院）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，金研院更加強調其活動的政策相關性。這反映在其研討會活動和訪問學者計劃中，特別是如此。金研院一直與主要中央銀行和政策機構聯合舉辦較高政策相關性的研討會。與此同時，於2016年推出的主題研究學者計劃，一直支持更多與香港金融管理局重要性相關的政策問題研究項目。\n\n在2017年，香港金融研究所（HKIMR）接待了18名研究學者，並公布了29篇工作論文。該研究所亦舉辦了4宗國際會議及工作坊，包括：\n- 以「中國經濟再平衡：何去何從？」為題的第八輪國際中華經濟會議於1月在香港舉辦。該會議提供了一個論壇，供學者、政策制定者和業界專家討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析和政策議題。共有11篇高質量的研究論文現時呈現，涵蓋了多元化的議題，包括內地的經濟再平衡、結構性改革和國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率問題，以及內地的貨幣政策框架和傳導。\n- 第15屆香港金融研究所暑期工作坊於7月舉辦。該工作坊旨在提供一個機會，讓香港金融研究所和香港金融管理局的成員展示其研究論文，並提升研究人員與來訪學者之間的互動。\n- 香港金融管理局與國際結算銀行聯合舉辦的題為「匯率的價格、實質及金融影響」的會議於8月舉辦。該會議提供了一個深入且富有洞察力的討論平台。涵蓋了廣泛的重要議題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易定價系統、外匯儲備累積中的風險採取、以及外匯市場行為。\n- 香港金融管理局、美國聯邦儲備理事會和亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合贊助的以「非常規貨幣政策：經驗汲取」為題的會議於10月舉辦。該會議檢討了過去十年間主要中央銀行非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP及其對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟和金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","terms":{"city":["城市"],"end":["年底"],"people":["市民"],"built":["建立"],"expanded":["擴展"],"achieving":["取得"],"continuing":["持續"],"pursue":["追求"],"us":["我們"],"saw":["見到"],"abound":["潛藏"],"record":["紀錄"],"remained":["仍然"],"since":["自"],"HK":["香港"],"49":["49%"],"launch":["推出"],"first":["首"],"adoption":["採用"],"webpage":["專頁"],"year":["年"],"increasing":["增加"],"facilitating":["促進"],"billion":["億"],"’":["的"],"lives":["生活"],"great":["重大"],"marks":["適逢"],"competence":["能力"],"developments":["發展"],"reversal":["逆轉"],"indicated":["顯示"],"Thanks":["經"],"brought":["帶來"],"secure":["安全"],"introduction":["推出"],"classified":["不良"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"developers":["地產商"],"2014":["2014年"],"transform":["轉型"],"developing":["開展"],"widening":["擴闊"],"strengthen":["鞏固"],"operate":["運作"],"campaign":["計劃"],"upgrade":["升級"],"maintained":["維持"],"technological":["科技"],"hence":["因而"],"2008":["2008年"],"highlight":["突顯"],"era":["新紀元"],"among":["位居…前列"],"role":["地位"],"41":["41%"],"weathered":["克服"],"addition":["此外"],"fell":["跌"],"pursuing":["追求"],"enhancing":["加強"],"coming":["未來"],"launched":["推出"],"times":["次"],"stepped":["加強"],"efforts":["努力"],"February":["2月"],"1.8":["1.8%"],"concerted":["多方"],"established":["設立"],"11.74":["11.74%"],"together":["一同"],"ensure":["保證"],"result":["造成"],"weaken":["走弱"],"responsibilities":["責任"],"play":["發揮"],"modules":["專業資歷"],"RMB900":["9,000億元人民幣"],"2010":["2010年"],"practitioners":["從業員"],"second":["第二"],"involved":["參與"],"closures":["結業"],"integrated":["融入"],"implement":["落實"],"moving":["邁進"],"make":["讓"],"give":["帶來"],"part":["部分"],"convenient":["方便"],"case":["一旦"],"dropped":["下跌"],"also":["亦"],"gained":["錄得"],"May":["5月"],"always":["一向"],"vigilant":["嚴陣以待"],"created":["締造"],"undoubtedly":["顯示"],"light":["情況下"],"round":["輪"],"needs":["所需"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"sustainable":["可持續"],"competition":["競爭"],"2.2":["2.2%"],"increase":["上升"],"7.85":["7.85"],"foundation":["根基"],"accounts":["賬戶"],"revealed":["暴露"],"quarter":["四分之一"],"smoothly":["有序"],"maintain":["保持"],"perform":["發揮"],"recurrence":["重蹈"],"week":["同周"],"3,000":["3,000"],"set":["設立"],"dollars":["美元"],"several":["多個"],"last":["去年"],"including":["包括"],"shocks":["衝擊"],"high":["新高"],"pace":["步伐"],"world":["全球"],"within":["內"],"response":["呼應"],"stated":["強調"],"century":["世紀"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"significant":["顯著"],"adhered":["秉承"],"25th":["25周年"],"satisfactory":["佳績"],"changing":["變"],"extending":["延續"],"Given":["鑑於"],"page":["專頁"],"close":["緊密"],"greater":["更大"],"September":["9月"],"ever":["以來"],"held":["舉辦"],"introduced":["推出"],"coverage":["覆蓋"],"need":["需求"],"Six":["6"],"develop":["發展"],"include":["包括"],"triggered":["觸發"],"manage":["管理"],"25":["25"],"restrain":["制約"],"wage":["工資"],"leveraging":["善用"],"eighth":["第八輪"],"improvement":["改善"],"all-time":["歷史"],"consolidate":["鞏固"],"Enormous":["龐大"],"highlighted":["突顯"],"stood":["高達"],"importance":["重要性"],"agile":["機動"],"responsible":["肩負"],"pivotal":["樞紐"],"reached":["達"],"allowing":["讓"],"good":["好"],"independent":["獨立"],"highs":["新高"],"0.72":["0.72%"],"put":["將"],"0.54":["0.54%"],"advantage":["優勢"],"spotlight":["焦點"],"prevent":["避免"],"around":["約"],"dialogue":["溝通"],"used":["動用"],"cure":["治療"],"safeguard":["保障"],"appropriate":["適當"],"months":["月"],"prompting":["促使"],"particular":["特別"],"advancement":["推動"],"providing":["提供"],"highest":["最高"],"saying":["有云"],"without":["未有"],"nimble":["機動"],"store":["便利店"],"achieved":["取得"],"oversight":["監督"],"corrections":["調整"],"implications":["影響"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"effort":["努力"],"meet":["應對"],"maintaining":["維持"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"continued":["繼續"],"position":["地位"],"minimise":["減低"],"35":["35%"],"expense":["損害"],"empower":["幫助"],"worked":["合作"],"years":["年"],"2018":["2018年"],"closely":["密切"],"issuance":["發行"],"establishing":["樹立"],"long":["長期"],"diversified":["多元化"],"underscores":["突顯"],"landscape":["生態"],"healthy":["健康"],"promoting":["推動"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"easily":["不易"],"solid":["紥實"],"ongoing":["持續"],"task":["任務"],"efficient":["快捷"],"recently":["近期"],"gradual":["逐步"],"back":["背靠"],"positive":["正面"],"fail":["倒"],"perspective":["來看"],"106":["106頁"],"laying":["打下"],"advisable":["應該"],"various":["多個"],"innovation":["創新"],"follow":["跟進"],"attaches":["注重"],"widespread":["廣泛"],"Many":["許多"],"downside":["下行"],"relying":["依靠"],"T.L":["T.L."],"hikes":["加息"],"status":["地位"],"264":["2,640億"],"inaugural":["首屆"],"offer":["帶來"],"bullish":["牛氣沖天"],"next":["之後"],"reappraise":["重新評估"],"society":["社會"],"continue":["繼續"],"outlying":["離島"],"taking":["採取"],"roles":["角色"],"strengthened":["加強"],"areas":["地區"],"one":["一"],"nurturing":["培育"],"Indeed":["事實上"],"levels":["水平"],"enhance":["提升"],"worst":["最壞"],"actively":["積極"],"successful":["成功"],"line":["主軸"],"convenience":["便利"],"normal":["正常"],"trillion":["兆"],"deteriorating":["惡化"],"movements":["走勢"],"currently":["現時"],"impetus":["動力"],"pressure":["壓力"],"8,000":["8,000"],"launching":["開展"],"supporting":["支持"],"arranged":["安排"],"gains":["回報"],"Supporting":["支持(組合)"],"1.7":["1,700億"],"reduction":["縮減"],"Regardin

銀行穩定性\n\n二零一七年，香港金融管理局繼續將其監管重點放在認可機構的風險管治框架的有效性上，包括信貸和流動性風險管理系統。在該年內，另一輪逆轉週期宏觀審慎措施被推出，以鞏固銀行業抵禦房地產市場任何逆轉的韌性。隨著網絡威脅不斷上升，香港金融管理局加強了對認可機構的科技風險管理的監管。與此同時，香港金融管理局推出七項舉動，預備香港邁入智慧銀行的新紀元。認可機構的反洗錢和反恐融資控制的有效性仍然是香港金融管理局的關鍵監管重點，作為其應付金融犯罪的努力之一。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局採取了進一步措施，以推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融普及化，並解決中小企業和初創公司在香港開設和維持賬戶所遇到的困難。亦取得努力，以提升對認可機構投資和保險產品銷售實務的監管，以進一步鞏固客戶保護。\n\n在不斷變化的銀行環境和不斷演變的風險生態下，為配合能力建設的需求，金管局與業界協調，發展董事賦權計劃和提升銀行從業員能力框架。在本地落實國際審慎及會計標準方面，取得了重大進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨平穩資金比率、大額風險限額、恢復計劃和國際財務報告準則第9號。\n\n《金融機構（決策）條例》於7月2017日生效，使香港成為少數具備全面跨行業金融機構決策制度的金融穩定委員會成員地區。該條例樹立了金融穩定性的一條主軸，賦予貨幣機管局必要權力以有序方式管理金融機構的倒閉，在該等倒閉可能對整體金融體系造成不利影響的情況下。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的一般目標是推動銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。取得這個目標取決於金融體系具備強大的承受衝擊能力，並能提供香港經濟所需的重要金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營的方式，以及在極端情況下以混亂的方式倒閉，可以影響系統的穩定性。作為監管機構，貨幣當局在維護金融穩定方面扮演著關鍵的地位，透過確保銀行具有強大的承受衝擊能力，並能在危機時恢復其地位，這最終有助於避免破產。貨幣當局肩負香港銀行業務的審慎監督責任，包括接受存款業務。其職責是授權在香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，它們共同稱為認可機構（AIs）。貨幣當局亦肩負指定特定金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的監督責任。\n\n然而，認可機構不能保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反，認可機構作為決策機關，致力於保證在認可機構倒閉的事件中，決策程序可以有秩序地進行，以維持認可機構向其顧客提供的關鍵金融服務的延續性。為此，香港為金融機構設立了一項決策機制，認可機構為其中之一，而認可機構是該決策機制下的決策機關。\n\n#

概覽監督活動\n\n於2017年，進行了192項離場審查，涵蓋了廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評級1、企業管治、業務營運及金融機構的風險管理。作為香港金融管理局繼續努力推動金融機構風險管治更強勁的措施之一，香港金融管理局舉辦了30次會議，與金融機構的董事會或董事級委員會進行討論，重點關注重要的風險管理議題。香港金融管理局亦進行了一項調查，以監察金融機構對其近期企業管治指引的採用情況。此外，亦舉辦了27日香港金融管理局、金融機構及其外部審計師之間的三方會議。\n\n除場外活動外，金管局繼續進行定期的現場檢查，輔以對評估為較高風險的地區進行主題審查。這種做法容許金管局將監管資源的重點放在人工智能所面對的新興及更顯著的風險。金管局在該年進行了401次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理和控制仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一重點是科技風險和營運風險管理。金管局亦增加了海外檢查的數字，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/反恐融資）控制的現場檢查和主題審查的數字。亦由專門團隊進行了對人工智能在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關業務中的活動的現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n總體銀行貸款增長了16.1%，與2016年6.5%的增長相比。根據表2所載，貸款增長是廣泛的。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款增長了17.5%，至2017年底達4,188億香港元（表3）。這包括在香港註冊成立銀行的內地子公司入帳的644億香港元貸款。\n\n人工智能資產素質在2017年仍然健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72% 輕微下降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2.2%。整體而言，銀行業的不良貸款比率從0.85% 下降至0.67%。 فيما يتعلق與中國大陸相關的貸款，零售銀行此類貸款的不良貸款比率在2017年從0.82% 輕微下降至0.75%。整體而言，該比率從一年前的80% 下降至0.67%。\n\n在該年，香港金融管理局加強了其監管努力，以保證人工智能繼續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，對人工智能對主要企業的風險敞口監控工作得到了提升。 進行了有針對性的主題檢查，重點關注關鍵信貸風險管理控制，例如貸款承銷標準、貸款分類和撥備制度、信貸風險治理框架以及對地產商貸款、資產擔保融資和保險費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n物業價格在2017年繼續上升。有更多由金融機構提供的貸款涉及有多個按揭或收入來自香港以外的借款人。鑒於這些發展，香港金融管理局於5月19日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第第八輪措施包括提高金融機構批准新的住宅按揭貸款時資本風險權重下限，降低適用於有現有按揭的借款人的物業按揭貸款貸款價値比率上限，以及降低適用於收入主要來自香港以外的借款人的債務收入比率上限。\n\n香港金管局自2009年推出針對物業按揭貸款的宏觀審慎措施，提升了銀行對與房地產市場相關風險的抵禦能力。新的住宅按揭貸款平均貸款價值比率在2017年12月跌至49%，較2009年9月推出逆周期措施前的64%有所下降。平均負債收入比亦下降至2017年12月的35%，較2010年8月的41%有所降低，當時首次應用負債收入比率上限（圖1）。\n\n金管局見到部分地產商以較高䅡桿為其房地產發展項目融資，部分地產商向買家提供按揭，其貸款價値比率較高。為解決這些發展帶來的風險，金管局於5月12日推出新的風險管理措施，規管向地產商貸款。這些措施包括要求認可機構降低建築融資的融資上限；要求認可機構為其向擁有較高按揭貸款與股本比例的地產商貸款撥備更多資本；以及進行一輪主題檢查，以保證銀行繼續跟進審慎的貸款承銷標準，以向地產商提供貸款。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局與地政總署合作開展電子警示服務，於2月推出。此電子警示服務會向相關的認可機構提供通知，只要有關按揭物業的進一步按揭已提交予地政總署註冊，以便按揭銀行可選持適當的風險緩解行動。\n\n# 營運及科技風險之監控\n\n網絡安全威脅在一年內繼續上升。香港金融管理局加強其監管努力，以提升銀行業的網絡安全韌性。作為香港金融管理局於2016年推出的網絡安全加強計劃（CFI）的一部分，30家機構完成了對其網絡防禦期滿程度的評估。另一方面，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會在與銀行及證券業界進行廣泛諮詢後，聯合決定為網上股份交易推出強制性雙重認證。亦進行了一輪實地檢查，重點關注銀行網絡安全控制和運營韌性。香港金融管理局進一步完成了一輪與主要銀行高層管理人員的討論，以評估銀行如何管理潛在的新市場參與者帶來的策略風險，這些參與者受益於科技推動。\n\n# 智能銀行\n\n9月，香港金融管理局宣布了一系列措施，以協助香港的銀行業進入智慧銀行的新紀元。在監管方面，香港金融管理局提升金融科技監管沙盒至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行和科技公司均可使用的聊天室設施，以及香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會和保險業監管局位居…前列的沙盒之間的聯繫，以便提供單一的進入點，以進行跨領域金融科技產品的測試。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出「銀行營運容易」倡議，旨在識別及減低監管上的阻礙，從而提升顧客使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的經驗。一個專案小組已設立，現時重點關注遠程開戶及帳戶維護、網上金融及網上財富管理。\n\n已展開對現行虛擬銀行授權指引的回顧，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行。\n\n# 庫務活動與流動性風險之監管\n\n鑒於美國繼續回復至正常其貨幣政策，全球資金流動可能變得越來越 volatile。為此，香港金管局今年加強了對流動風險監管的重點。香港金管局提升了其監管流動性壓力測試，並增發了額外情境，包括一個更嚴峻但合理的資金外流情境，以及一個短期、信心驅動的銀行擠兌情境。香港金管局亦加強了對個別機構的流動性狀況監測和分析，並規定選定的機構鞏固其流動風險管理能力。\n\n另一方面，香港金融管理局進行了更多關於人工智能在債券投資組合中市場風險管理的實地檢查。進行了一輪主題審查，以評估人工智能增加外幣債券投資活動所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相應的風險管理成效，包括對沖措施。\n\n# 防洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖資金融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》2017年於6月23日憲報，並將於2018年開始運作。此修訂旨在根據金融行動專案組（FATF）頒布的最新國際要求，更新香港的反洗錢及反恐怖資金融資監管制度。 這些變更，一同與反洗錢及反恐怖資金融資法定指引的更新，將有助於釐清並落實客戶盡職審查（CDD）程序中的風險基準方法，以用於開戶及維持真實顧客，並鼓勵在遙距進行這些程序時的創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港的地位作為國際金融中心，金管局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，旨在促進銀行和支付行業金融科技發展和使用的七項新舉措，受到持份者和公眾的亦肯定。經一連串在網絡和能力建設方面的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象亦得到提升。推出「債券通」進一步鞏固了香港作為通往內地機遇的主要門戶的地位。金管局在其他地區（例如企業資金管理中心）的努力亦有所成果。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑒於快速的科技發展，香港金融管理局於9月宣布推出七項舉動，預備香港進入智能銀行的新紀元。 這些舉動包括：\n- 開展加快支付系統 (FPS)，以爭取數碼零售支付的十足連繫；\n- 推出開放應用程式介面 (Open API) 框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究和人才開展；\n- 提升金融科技跨境合作；\n- 將現有的金融科技監管沙盒 (FSS) 1.0 升級至 2.0 版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行推出；以及\n- 推動全新的「銀行服務更便捷」倡議，以減低顧客數碼經驗中的監管阻力。\n\n香港金融科技促進辦公室 (FFO)，一同與香港金融管理局的銀行部門發揮樞紐的地位，推動這些措施的落實，以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的夥伴數字增長至2018年1月31日的全87個，較最初的約40%大幅增長。在該年，IFFO舉辦並參與了超過10個研討會和工作坊，以促進主要持份者之間的經驗分享和合作聯繫。特別是，IFFO在其首屆債務融資和投資者圓桌會議中主導了基礎設施股權投資的參考條款表制定，旨在加強基礎設施項目的銀行信貸度和投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於7月推出，標誌着香港與內地資本市場互聯互通的另一重要里程碑，進一步鞏固我們為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。年內，香港的人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由2,700億元人民幣上升至5,000億元人民幣。香港維持全球最大的人民幣離岸流動資金庫，以暢旺的人民幣金融中介活動為證，這體現在我們人民幣即時總結算（RTGS）系統的高交易量，以及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中所佔的最大股份。\n\n繼2016年推出企業財資中心（CTCs）的稅務制度後，香港金融管理局加強其宣傳努力，以吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立庫務中心。截至2017年底，超過40%的企業向香港金融管理局反映，他們正在積極計劃設立，或已設立庫務中心業務於香港。\n\n香港金融管理局積極貢獻於國際討論，議題對全球及區域金融穩定具有重要性。香港金融管理局行政總裁於4月擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，以領導有關重要金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n安全且快捷的香港金融基礎設施運作，為香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位奠定了紥實的根基。4宗銀行同業大額即時轉移系統及中央資金市場單位（CMU）在2017年取得100%的系統可用率，較目標的99.95%為高。為支持「債券通」北向交易，CMU已設立與內地兩家中央證券存管機構（CSD）的賬戶，以促進「債券通」交易的結算，並代表有關的CMU成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為推動本地零售支付行業的一般安全及效率，香港金融管理局於8月指定4宗零售支付系統（RPSs）受《支付條例》（PSSVFO）的監督。香港金融管理局亦進行了對16間儲值設施（SVF）持牌人的監督，而這些持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，旨在為顧客帶來更多選擇及理想使用者經驗。另一方面，電子支票及電子結單付款（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，包括香港與全部廣東省之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017 年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行措施\n\n鑒於科技的快速發展情況下，香港金融管理局於9月宣布了七項舉動，旨在預備香港進入智慧銀行新紀元。這些舉動旨在幫助銀行業上升到較高水平，並把握由銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n「智能銀行會帶來十足的互相連繫給零售和企業顧客，並讓金融服務和交易得以執行具有重大的流動性、速度、緩和和安全性。」\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業及金融科技界密切工作，並在實施七項措施方面取得好進展。\n\n# 加快支付系統\n\n快速支付系統是一個多幣種平台，會讓公眾能夠以十足的便利性，使用手機號碼或電郵地址以即時方式進行全天候資金轉帳。它支援香港美元和人民幣支付。銀行和非銀行支付服務提供者可以參與快速支付系統，讓所有付款參與者之間連繫緊密。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，快速支付系統預定於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局帶領一個工作小組，由主要信用卡計劃營運商、銀行、持牌SVF營運商和商戶收單機構組成，以建立香港零售支付的通用二維碼標準。 通用二維碼標準會促進商戶使用單一二維碼來接受來自多個支付服務提供者的二維碼支付方案，為顧客和商戶提供更大便利。 這個工作小組已最終確定有關技術規格，並會制定落實安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放式API讓銀行數據可供第三方存取，以促進更理想及更便捷的銀行服務與其他行業的融入。使用者因此可方便地停留在一系統中，於安全環境下享用融入式服務。為促進銀行界開放式API的發展和採用，金管局擬定了一份開放式API框架草案，內容包括開放式API職能的選擇和部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、促進措施及維護模式，以供業界諮詢兩個月。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n其中一項主要研究項目是關於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年首份DLT白皮書公布後，第二份DLT白皮書於10月2017年公布。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三項概念驗證工作，即貿易融資、數位身分管理和房屋貸款申請。它亦提供關於落實治理、法律合規以及一般控制原則於銀行和支付行業部署DLT的意見。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳 Norman 先生宣布於香港金融科技日發表有關區塊鏈技術的第二份白皮書。\n\n憑藉香港金融管理局帶領的貿易融資概念驗證工作的成功，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，並將其發展成為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP），以數碼化及分享貿易文件，並自動化流程，從而提升整體貿易流程，降低貿易融資業務的風險和欺詐行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技業界的人才庫，香港金融管理局與香港應用科學與科技研究院合作，於2016年12月推出金融科技人才加速計劃。學生們的呼應是正面的。收到了超過3,000份申請，來自421名申請人。最終，74名學生公認了香港金融管理局和12家銀行的實習機會，從7月起，為期6個月或1年，參與金融科技相關項目。\n\n# 跨國合作\n\n作為加強我們在廣東-香港-澳門大灣區內合作的首個步驟，我們正與深圳合作推動金融科技和人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽訂協議，以（一）為金融科技公司提供互惠的軟著陸支援；（二）於10月共同舉辦深圳-香港金融科技獎，以表彰並獎勵兩地傑出的金融科技產品和解決方案；以及（三）為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技和科技金融公司的暑期實習。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳 Norman (中) 與金融發展事務署署長何曉軍 (左) 及數碼港主席林 George  李 (李) 博士在香港金融管理局金融科技日上簽署及交換關於軟落地安排的諒解備忘錄。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎電子傳單。\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及杜拜金融服務管理局簽署金融科技合作協議，內容涵蓋創新項目、創新企業的轉介、資訊分享以及專業知識交流。\n\n11月，香港金融管理局與新加坡金融管理局進一步簽署諒解備忘錄，聯合建立全球貿易連繫網絡（GTCN），該網絡會將新加坡的國家貿易平台與香港貿易 financiing 平台連接，以便形成跨境分佈式賬本技術基礎設施，從而數字化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、更快捷和更具成本效益。它將是一個開放平台，允許其他感興趣的地區在未來參與。GTCN預計於2019年首四分之一推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局於2016年9月推出的「金融科技監管沙盒」已升級至2.0版本，以促進與銀行和科技公司之間的溝通，並提供新的想法和舉措。具體而言，2.0版本具有以下新功能：\n- 設立一個金融科技監管聊天室，以便在金融科技項目的早期階段提供意見給銀行和科技公司。\n- 科技公司可以透過聯匯聊天室的意見，而未有透過銀行，即可進入「金融科技監管沙盒」。\n- 金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和保險業監管局的沙盒互相連接，以便為跨領域金融科技產品的試點計劃提供單一重點進入點。\n\n截至2017年底，已有28項新科技產品在金融穩定服務（FSS）中經過考驗。在這些宗案件中，14%的試點已完成，而有關產品隨後推出至市場。\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

儲備管理\n\n全球經濟和金融市場在2017年的表現比預期更理想。全球股市在主要發達和新興市場經濟同步增長、企業盈利強勁以及市場對主要中央銀行緩慢且逐步收緊貨幣政策的預期的帶動下上漲。儘管美國聯邦儲備局如期提升利率三次，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表，但10年期美國國債收益率仍然平穩，而美元相對於其他主要貨幣回落（不...反而加強）。在這樣有利的環境下，外匯基金的投資收入在2017年達到了紀錄新高，為香港2,640億元，為投資回報率7.4%。\n\n# 結匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》訂立的，外匯基金的**主要**目標是**影響****直接或間接**地**影響****香港**貨幣的匯價。該基金**亦**可**動用**以**保持****香港**貨幣及金融系統的穩定和**健全**，以**幫助**維持**香港**作為國際金融中心。外匯基金受財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢外匯基金諮詢**委員會**後，按他**認為**為**適當**的證券或其他資產進行投資。\n\n# 結匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n金融管理局為外匯基金設立了以下投資目標：\n(a) 保障本金；\n(b) 保證在任何次，全部的貨幣基礎都由流通性極高、以美元計價的資產支持；\n(c) 保證有足夠的流通性不詳，以幫助維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在前提下(a)–(c)，爭取投資回報，以幫助保障基金的長期實力。\n\n這些目標選持交易所基金的法定目的，並已納入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置。\n\n大致而言，外匯基金擁有兩大主要投資組合：儲備投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。儲備投資組合持有流通性極高以美元計價的資產，以提供十足的 Monetary Base 保障，符合《聯繫匯率制度》的規定。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展機構成員國家債券和股權市場，以保障資產的價值和長期實力。\n\n為更理想地管理風險並提升長期回報，香港金融管理局一直以審慎及循序漸進的方式分散投資港幣儲備基金的投資組合，增加多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權和房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長投資組合的投資市值上限設定為港幣儲備基金累積盈餘的三分之一，並可因撥出未來基金的第部分資產用於長期資產而進一步增加。\n\n為策略投資組合，於2007年設立，以持有香港交易所結算有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府代表交換基金購入，用於策略目的，由於此投資組合的獨特性質，故未將其包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般聯匯於IP1的表現，例外是未來基金，其利率視乎投資組合的配置，與IP和LTGP均有聯網。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP和LTGP之間的投資組合配置約為65：35。預期未來基金與LTGP聯網的部分將逐步增加至2018年約50%。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n交易所基金的投資流程因...而提升於兩類別資產分配的決定：策略性資產分配和戰略性地資產分配。策略性資產分配反映於投資基準，代表鑑於交易所基金的投資目標所定的長期最佳資產分配。在策略性分配的指導下，資產會戰略性地分配，以爭取超越基準的超額回報。這意味著實際分配往往不同於基準，或策略性分配。實際分配與基準分配之間的差距稱為「戰略性地偏離」。基準和追蹤誤差限制由財政司司長在諮詢金管局金融穩定委員會後定出，而戰略性地決定和容許的戰略性地偏離範圍則由金管局在授權下取得並設立。在容許的戰略性地偏離範圍內，投資組合經理人可選持立場以利用短期走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部人員直接管理約73%的交換基金投資，包括全部的BP及部分IP。IP的這部分包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多個實施宏觀風險管理的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n此外管理內部資產，香港金融管理局僱用外部基金經理管理約27日的交換基金資產，包括其所有上市股權投資組合和其他專門的資產類別。僱用外部經理的目的在於運用市場上最佳的投資專業知識以獲取可持續回報，從多樣且互補的投資方式中受惠，並與交換基金分享市場心得和技術專長。\n\n與外部經理人使用相關的支出包括基金管理和保管費用、交易成本，以及預扣和其他稅款。這筆支出主要由市場因素定出，並且可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規性\n\n金融市場在2008年全球金融危機後的劇烈波動，突顯了風險管理的重要性。為內部及外圍方面管理的投資組合，已設立嚴格的控制和投資指引，並密切監察對指引和規例的遵守情況。風險評估已加強，以支持香港金融管理局上升的投資多元化步伐。風險控制工具被採用來評估在正常及不利市場狀況下的市場風險。詳細的績效歸因分析亦進行，以識別績效的資料來源，讓香港金融管理局能讓最佳地使用內部及外部經理的投資技能。\n\n# 肩負投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任投資。例如，香港金融管理局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發行的《負責任擁有權原則》，該原則屬自願性，並幫助投資者釐定在香港上市公司的投資中，如何最好地肩負其擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，香港金融管理局已鼓勵其香港股票投資組合中指定的外部基金經理採用《負責任擁有權原則》。此外，前線部門及風險管理及合規部已將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入多個內部程序，以制定和監察投資活動。香港金融管理局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入投資流程。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2017 年的金融市場\n\n全球經濟與金融市場在2017年表現理想於預期。 由於主要已開發及新興市場經濟同步增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場對主要中央銀行緩慢且逐步收緊貨幣政策的預期，全球股市表現亦佳。 特別是，香港股市上升了36%，出色於其他主要股市。\n\n在債券市場，美國短期國債收益率飆升，因為美國聯準會如預期提升利率三次，並於10月開始收縮其資產負債表。然而，10年期美國國債收益率在一年內仍然平穩於約2.4%。其他主要10年期政府債券收益率亦在年底時變動不大，德國公債是例外，因歐元範疇內的紥實經濟增長以及市場對歐洲中央銀行收緊政策的預期而上升。\n\n在貨幣市場中，儘管美國聯邦儲備局的加息和其資產負債表縮減的開始，美元對其他主要貨幣回落。美元的下跌是歐洲和日本經濟回升的造成，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策收窄。歐元和日圓在2017年分別對美元升值約14%和4%。\n\n2017年主要貨幣以及債券和股票市場的表現亦所載於表1。\n\n表 1 2017 年市場回報\n\n# 匯風基金的表現\n\n貨幣儲備基金於2017年錄得投資回報2,640億香港元。這包括海外股權投資的回報804億香港元、香港股權投資的回報583億香港元、債券的回報344億香港元、非香港元資產的正面估值上調535億香港元，以及貨幣儲備基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資回報374億香港元。另一方面，策略投資組合錄得估值回報45億香港元。\n\n香港外匯基金去年的投資收入達2,640億港元，創下新高，高出2007年（1,422億港元）的次高紀錄1,218億港元。\n\n於年底，交易所基金的總資產達香港 40,153 億港元。長期投資策略下的投資市值總值 2,356 億港元，其中私募股權為 1,572 億港元，房地產為 784 億港元。未償投資承諾總值 1624 億港元。\n\n於2017年，交易所基金的投資回報率（不包括策略組合）為7.4%。具體而言，房地產投資組合取得12.1%的回報率，而債券投資組合錄得1.8%的回報率。自2009年成立以來，長期增長策略錄得13.7%的年化內部收益率。\n\n香港外匯基金自1994年至2017年的年度回報載於圖1。表2顯示了2017年的投資回報，以及基金在多個不同年期內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年的平均回報為2.5%，過去十年的平均回報為2.2%，自1994年以來則為4.9%。表3顯示了截至2017年12月31日，基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁余偉文（中）先生在二零一七年外匯基金結算報告記者會上發言。\n\n圖

A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the

公司職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳媒、公眾教育計劃及其他多個渠道，維持與社群和市場的有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策和運作的了解。在過去一年，香港金融管理局繼續加強企業管治，支持員工的專業發展，嚴格控制財務紀律，並加強資訊科技保安，以應付來自新措施落實和工作繁重所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 僱用社區企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒密切合作，以提升透明度，並推動公眾對其政策和工作的了解。於2017年，共舉辦了86個開放的記者會活動，包括九個記者會、16次即時採訪和61個其他公共職能。此外，安排了42次傳媒採訪，並發行了共360份雙語新聞稿。管理局亦每天處理大量的數字媒體查詢。\n\n為提升對金管局的職能的認識，已為傳媒舉辦導覽參觀重新翻新的金管局資訊中心。此外，為本地及海外傳媒進行了深入的傳媒簡報和教育工作坊，內容廣泛，包括債券通計劃、按揭貸款的審慎措施、決議機制及外匯基金投資。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳 Norman 先生在香港金融管理局資訊中心向傳媒推出一幅藝術作品，稱為「小錢大頌」。這幅作品以香港維多利亞港和香港天際線為特色，使用總共 135,811 枚不同面額的香港硬幣締造而成。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳 Norman 先生與本地報章進行傳媒訪問，在香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室的主要舉措方面。\n\n# 公眾諮詢\n\n香港金融管理局公共查詢服務提供了一個有效的途徑，讓公眾更理想地了解金管局的主要職能和運作。二零一七年共處理了8,752宗查詢，其中下半年約有相關的查詢涉及銀行政策和規例、貨幣和經濟議題、消費者銀行服務以及紙幣和硬幣。明顯的例子包括收集紙幣計劃、銀行產品和服務、與銀行相關的指引和通函、貨幣和經濟統計數據、物業按揭貸款的審慎措施，以及防止洗錢和恐怖融資。\n\n圖 1 顯示自

刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年報外，於2017年，香港金融管理局公布了兩期《下半年貨幣及金融穩定報告》，以及4宗《季度通訊》，並定期發行《每月統計通訊》更新，以提供最新的主題性貨幣、銀行及經濟資訊和分析，涵蓋香港的多個相關議題。此外，香港金融管理局發行了共23篇文章，涵蓋其工作相關的各種熱門議題。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局網站（www.hkma.gov.hk），包含超過六萬個英文、繁體中文和簡體中文頁，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的門戶。它亦包含認可金融機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及AIs證券人員的登記冊，兩者均根據《銀行業條例》第20條維持，還包括根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維持的儲值設施（SVF）牌照人登記冊。專設網頁和醒目的快捷聯網旨在吸引公眾對香港金融管理局的新舉措的關注，例如開戶、SVF的監管制度、基礎設施融資便利辦事處和金融科技便利辦事處，以及重要和及時的資訊，例如提醒大家需求嚴陣以待，以防偽冒電話，以及《收集硬幣計劃》下的硬幣收集地點。\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n香港金融管理局位於國際金融中心55樓的資訊中心，是一個重要的資源，推出香港金融管理局的工作予社會大眾，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的認識。它包括一個展覽範疇和一個圖書館，並同周開放六天。展覽範疇推出香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展。它亦包含閱讀材料和展覽品，以研究香港的貨幣、銀行和金融事務。\n\n資訊中心政策專區的新面貌，推出香港金融管理局的工作及相關金融概念，在完成翻新工程後，於2017年2月24日重新啟用。 翻新後的政策專區包含多個互動遊戲和裝置，將發揮融入學習，並以簡單的方式解釋複雜的金融概念。 訪客的意見正面。\n\n學生在資訊中心政策部分的教育遊戲中嘗試，以了解香港金融管理局的工作。\n\n導覽團為訪客舉辦。在過去一年，中心收到超過五萬九千名訪客，並為學校和其他團體舉辦了超過六百五十個導覽團（圖 3）。自二零零三年十二月啟用以來，已有超過六十四萬五千名市民參觀了資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽範疇之後，藏有超過23,000本書籍、期刊及其他刊物，供研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行議題之用。它亦維持人工智能及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及根據銀行條例第20節規定的人工智能的證券人員登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心圖書館。\n\n為接觸社區及提升市民對香港金融管理局工作的認識，香港金融管理局於2017年舉辦4宗公眾教育研討會，約有2,000名第二學校學生及老師參與。研討會內容包括聯匯匯率制度、香港紙幣、銀行穩定性、消費者保護、存款保障計劃、金融科技、一帶一路倡議以及金融業的職業發展。自1998年推出以來，已有超過58,400名市民參與此公眾教育計劃。\n\n學生和教師來自不同區的學校參加其中一場公眾教育研討會。\n\n圖

人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招聘、發展及維持高度專業的人才隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對變動的工作優先次序。雖然香港金融管理局是政府不可分割的**部分**，但它**僱用**員工的**以...計**方式與公務員制度**不同**，以**吸引**具備**右**的**經驗**和專業知識的人員。作為一個公眾**機構**，香港金融管理局旨在**保持**精簡和靈活的架構，並在可行情況下，重新調配員工資源以開展新措施和**應對****增加**的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n決策辦公室於2017年4月1日設立，以落實於2016年6月頒布的金融機構（決策）條例。辦公室旨在保證香港的決策機制能夠為銀行運作。這對於加強香港銀行業在任何事件中的韌性至關重要。\n\n# 人手配置\n\n香港金融管理局於2017年的設立為927。這將增加35至962 (上升3.8%)，以保證提供足夠資源以應付新措施以及現有工作的繁重和增加。新增職能採用如下：\n\n加強銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n    – 加強支持推出加快支付系統及便利銀行措施的能力；\n    – 加強監管能力，以應對銀行區域及業務擴張，並促進（一）金融科技在提供銀行服務方面的更廣泛採用，以及（二）與其他監管機構就網絡安全及金融科技問題的合作；以及\n    – 支持欺詐及洗錢情報工作組的工作，以打擊欺詐、洗錢及其他類別的金融犯罪，並加強對反洗錢及虛擬資產服務供應商法規執行的法律支持。\n- 加強投資、風險管理及其他相關支持，以進一步擴張及多元化交易所基金的投資活動。\n- 加快全球宏觀及金融 sector 監控，並加強人才發展計劃，以保證金管局擁有必要的人力資源，以應對機構的長期發展所需。\n\n表 1 提供了香港金融管理局的設立和強大情況的詳細說明。\n\n表 1 金管局於 2018年1月1日的設立及強大\n\n臨時資源被採用以應對其他工作需求。香港金融管理局亦調派成員以借調形式至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）和金融服務發展局，協助香港或金管局感興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分成員被採用全職或兼職形式，以提供運營支援給香港存款保障計劃及財資市場公會。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬檢討機制\n\n財政司司長（財司）根據治理委員會（治委會）透過外匯基金諮詢委員會（外匯諮委會）的意見，決定香港金融管理局員工的薪酬及服務狀況，並會考慮現行的市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括現金總包及強積金計劃，以及極少的實物利益。現金總包由每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）和浮動薪酬組成，浮動薪酬可視乎表現，每年以一次過形式頒發予個別成員。\n\n根據金融穩定委員會透過行政人員薪酬委員會向財政司提交的建議，財政司會在情況下年度檢討香港金融管理局員工的薪酬，並考慮金融穩定委員會對香港金融管理局過去一年的工作表現評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融界薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他有關因素。對於工作表現優秀的個別成員，或會不時調整薪酬，以保持他們的競爭力。\n\n任何批准的固定薪酬年度調整，以及香港金融管理局的任何浮動薪酬發放，均根據個別成員的表現分發。香港金融管理局的投資專業人士的薪酬制度旨在鞏固他們的投資表現與薪酬發放之間的聯繫。金融司長根據薪酬委員會的意見批准個別職級為總裁及以上的員工薪酬調整和發放。有關成員在討論其薪酬時不會現時出席會議。香港金融管理局的行政總裁根據金融司長的授權，並在已批准的整體薪酬發放的前提下，定出個別職級為處長及以下的員工薪酬調整和發放。\n\n#

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

匯豐基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立的審計師報告致財務司\n\n# 意見\n\n我證明我已審核了外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）於第157至243頁所載的財務報表，其中包括外匯基金及本集團於2017年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該年終結的其收益及支出賬戶、綜合收益報表、權益變動報表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表帶來真實及公平地反映基金及本集團於2017年12月31日的財務地位，以及截至該年終結的財務表現和現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會發行的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港會計準則」）妥為編製，且已根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官指示取得。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我進行了審計，按照行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7條所作的指示，以及審計署的審計準則。我在這些準則下的責任在我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」部分進一步說明。我與本集團保持獨立，按照這些準則，並且我已履行我的其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據是足夠及適當的，以提供我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為那些在我專業判斷下，對我審計2017年12月31日終結的財務報表而言，最具有重要性的事項。 這些事項已在對財務報表整體審計的背景下加以處理，並在形成我對此的意見時予以考慮，我不會就這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣管理機構成員肩負其他資料的責任。其他資料包括香港貨幣管理機關2017年年報所包含的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此表達任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n與我審核財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中，考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我於審核中取得的知識有重大不符，或以其他方式看來有重大錯誤陳述。 根據我所表現的工作，如果我認為此其他資料存在重大錯誤陳述，我規定要報告該事實。 在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 貨幣機管局及匯風諮詢委員會審核委員會的責任\n\n金融管理局肩負備製財務報表之責任，該等財務報表須按照香港會計師公會發行之香港財務報告準則，以及根據《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官指示所訂立的指引，真實及公允地反映財務狀況；並為金融管理局認為必要之內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局肩負評估本集團能否繼續經營的責任，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及使用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會肩負監管本集團財務報告程序的責任。\n\n# 審計師的責任，關於財務報表的審計\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確定整體財務報表是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並發行一份審計報告，其中包括我的意見。合理保證是高度保證，但並非保證按照審計署審計準則進行的審計一定會發現重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，如果它們個別或整體而言，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決定，則會被考慮為重大。\n\n作為按照審計署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑。我亦：\n- 識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是由於欺詐或錯誤所致，設計及執行對這些風險有回應的審計程序，並獲取足夠及適當的審計證據，以便為我的意見提供基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、不實陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上，因此由於欺詐而導致的重大錯誤陳述的風險較由於錯誤所導致的風險較高；\n- 為了設計適於當前狀況的審計程序，而對與審計相關的內部控制獲得了解，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣當局所使用的會計政策的適當性，以及會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局使用持續經營會計基準的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對本集團能否持續經營的能力產生重大懷疑的事件或狀況。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我需要在我審計報告中引起對財務報表中相關披露的關注，或者，如果這些披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我的審計報告日期的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或狀況可能導致本集團停止持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以能達到公允呈報的方式反映了相關的交易和事件；以及\n- 獲取有關本集團內實體或業務活動的充分適當審計證據，以便對財務報表發表意見。我肩負審計小組的方向、監督和發揮的責任。我對我的審計意見負單憑責任。\n\n我與外匯基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會溝通，在…方面，包括審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及顯著的審計結果，包括我在審計過程中識別出的任何內部控制的顯著缺陷。\n\n我亦提供給交易所基金諮詢委員會審計委員會一份聲明，證明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關保障。\n\n從與證券基金諮詢委員會審計委員會的溝通事項中，我釐定在現時期的財務報表審計中最重要的事項，因此這些是關鍵審計事項。我會在審計報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我釐定不應在報告中溝通該事項，因為這樣做的負面後果會合理預計超過此類溝通的公共利益。\n\n孫大衛\n審計主任\n\n11 4月 2018年\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定，貨幣管理當局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金控制人所授予的權力，管理該基金。該基金的主要活動是保障香港貨幣的匯價，並維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全。\n\n本基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：即後盾投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及策略投資組合。後盾投資組合的資產全面匹配香港貨幣發行局體系下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展機構的成員國家債券和股權市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所結算購入的股份，由香港特別行政區政府代表本基金作策略目的之用。運作範疇資訊載於附註30。\n\n# 2 顯著會計政策\n\n# 2.1% 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已按照所有適用香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製，而香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）是一個集體術語，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及由香港會計師公會（HKICPA）發行之詮釋，以及香港一般公認會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）所採用之顯著會計政策概要載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行特定新訂及修訂的香港財務報告準則，於現時會計期間首次生效或可供早期採用。附註三提供有關資訊，若因首次採用這些發展而導致會計政策的任何變更，且這些變更與本集團於現時及過往會計期間所反映於這些財務報表中的情況有關。\n\n# 2.2% 編製財務報表之依據\n\n本集團財務報表包括本集團的財務報表以及本集團於聯營公司和合資企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要業務所載於附註十六和十七。\n\n財務報表編製所用之計量基礎為歷史成本，除下列資產及負債乃按其公允價值列示，詳見下文所載之會計政策：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值衡量之金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註2.11）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.12）。\n\n根據經驗和多個其他被認為在當時情況下屬實的因素，財務報表依照香港財務報告準則編製，需要管理層讓判斷、估計和假設影響政策的應用以及報告的數額，包括資產、負債、收入和支出。這些估計和相關假設的結果，構成了對帳面價值不易從其他資料來源明顯顯現的資產和負債作出判斷的基礎。實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n這些估計和相關假設會持續檢討。對會計估計的修訂，如果修訂僅影響該期，則於該期認可；如果修訂影響現時和未來期，則於修訂期和未來期認可。\n\n附註18包含有關投資物業公允價值估計的相關假設。附註36包含有關金融工具公允價值估計的相關假設。除這些公允價值估計所涉及的會計判斷外，本集團應用會計政策沒有其他重要的會計判斷參與。\n\n# 2.3% 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由本集團控制的個體。本集團在對該個體有浮動回報的參與，並且有能力透過其對該個體的實力來影響這些回報時，便控制該個體。在評估本集團是否擁有實力時，僅考慮實質性權利（由本集團及其他各方持有）。\n"}
