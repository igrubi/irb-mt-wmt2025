{"en":"# Resilience in the face of adversity\n\nReverberations from slowing global economic growth amid a “high for longer” interest rate environment and intensifying geopolitical tensions — not just stemming from the RussiaUkraine war and China-US tensions but also the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East — were the key themes for the financial markets in 2023. The March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, the most significant system-wide banking stress since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, weighed further on market sentiment. Major economies grappled with the harsh realities of tightened monetary conditions and greater uncertainty over the inflationary path and interest rate outlook. Adding to the uncertainty was the pace of Mainland China’s economic recovery, which was slower than general market expectations.\n\nWith volatility and unpredictability becoming the “new normal” in financial markets, Hong Kong has again demonstrated its well-known ability to adapt, showing remarkable resilience. Since the city’s full-fledged post-COVID reopening last year, much work has been done to attract people back to our dynamic city and reconnect them with Hong Kong. The HKMA has contributed by hosting a series of large-scale international events such as the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and conferences with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which showcased our vibrant city and helped send the message worldwide that Hong Kong, as a major international financial centre (IFC), is open for business and remains the centre of action and innovation. There are clear signs of gradual recovery, driven by an encouraging revival of inbound tourism and improved private consumption, also supported by a resilient labour market and the various support measures rolled out by the Government. For 2023 as a whole, Hong Kong’s gross domestic product growth bounced back to 3.2% from negative territory in 2022.\n\nThe HKMA entered its fourth decade in 2023. The past 30 years have seen the dynamics of the economy and the financial markets change drastically, with technology driving advances beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. The invaluable experience and wisdom gained over the past three decades have enabled us to face the future with confidence. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and an uncertain external environment, the HKMA will continue to uphold its mandate of safeguarding monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, and will actively pursue developmental opportunities to anchor that stability and cement the city’s status as a leading IFC.\n\nFormer and current Financial Secretaries of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Chief Executives of HKMA at a gathering to celebrate the HKMA’s 30th anniversary: (from left) Mr Joseph Yam, Mr Henry Tang, Mr Donald Tsang, Mr Paul Chan, Mr Eddie Yue, Mr Antony Leung, Mr John Tsang, and Mr Norman Chan\n\n# LERS — Weathering the storms\n\nLast year marked the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), a staunch pillar supporting Hong Kong’s strong and stable monetary and financial systems. Four decades of transparent and effective operation have nurtured confidence in the LERS and its credibility in the market. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar stayed within the Convertibility Zone and the Hong Kong dollar market operated smoothly, reflecting the strong market confidence in the LERS, a confidence also shared and expressed by the International Monetary Fund and global market players.\n\nBehind this confidence lie the HKMA’s proactive efforts in public and market engagements, along with effective surveillance. We spared no effort during the year in communicating with key stakeholders to foster a clear understanding of the functioning of the LERS, which is all the more important in times of volatility, be it stemming from economic stress or political uncertainties. We also strengthened surveillance of our monetary system, leveraging the use of datasets from the trade repository and expanded granular data from banks, as well as advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, to enhance our capability, enabling more timely and comprehensive analysis of financial stability and macro-prudential surveillance.\n\n# Banking system — A major source of stability\n\nDespite a multitude of challenges including the high-interestrate environment, persistent geopolitical tensions and a challenging credit landscape, Hong Kong’s banking system remained stable throughout the year, underpinned by strong capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the consolidated total capital ratio of local banks stood at 21.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks edged up to 178.6% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, likewise well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. While the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 1.40% at the end of 2022 to 1.56% at the end of 2023, it remained below the long-term historical average of 2.0%. The increase was mainly driven by exposures to Mainland privately-owned enterprise (POE) property developers; but such exposure levels were generally well-contained as a result of banks’ prudent credit risk management over the years, and the overall asset quality of the banking sector remained sound.\n\nWhat caught most market players by surprise in 2023 was unquestionably the banking turmoil in the US spilling over to Europe, which created a level of system-wide banking stress unseen since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The HKMA remained on high alert as the situation unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to limit any potential adverse spillover effects on confidence in the local banking and financial systems. This, coupled with the strong capital and liquidity buffers maintained by banks in Hong Kong, meant that our banking sector was largely unaffected by the turmoil, remaining resilient even as the global financial markets were roiled. In the aftermath of this episode, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive internal review with a view to drawing out lessons for the local banking sector and strengthening the HKMA’s supervisory effectiveness and agility to handle a banking crisis should one occur.\n\nWhile prudent credit risk management is important, we have always reiterated our supervisory expectation for banks to be mindful of the need to support the real economy. As the orderly exit from the banking sector’s Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme commenced in July 2023 with the economic effects of COVID-19 receding, the HKMA worked closely with banks to ensure a gradual and smooth transition to normal loan repayment with flexibility for those borrowers who continued to be under pressure. Earlier this year, recognising that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still facing challenges in their operations despite the end of the pandemic, nine new measures were rolled out to further assist them in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nHaving reviewed the risks associated with the local property market in the context of banks’ property lending, the HKMA announced in July 2023 the first relaxation of the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties since their introduction in 2009. This relaxation increased the loan-to-value ratio cap for most residential mortgage loans as well as for financing for property development and investment. It was later followed by suspension of the interest rate stress testing requirement in early 2024.\n\nThe HKMA’s supervision of financial institutions has been moving with the times. With recent years having seen a sharp global increase in fraud cases, we have considerably stepped up our efforts to counter new fraud tactics by introducing a holistic set of measures to protect bank customers. These include enhancing information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies; strengthening the monitoring of suspicious transactions (including implementation of real-time fraud monitoring and tightened payment card authentication); empowering customers to have more controls on their payment cards; and educating customers and raising public awareness of frauds with the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, as well as a pre-transaction alert mechanism which warns users if a higher-risk Faster Payment System (FPS) transaction is spotted.\n\nIn light of a proliferation of innovative and digital banking products and services, the HKMA has worked with the banking industry to step up consumer and investor protection more broadly and enhance the banks’ operational and cyber resilience, as well as their collective defences against systemic cyber events. At the same time, all major banks have considerably strengthened their capabilities to respond to, and recover from, destructive ransomware attacks. The HKMA together with the industry has also pursued various consumer data infrastructure projects, such as the “Credit Data Smart” pilot programme to enhance consumer credit reference services, and taken forward a cross-boundary credit reference initiative to facilitate crossboundary financing activities by corporates.\n\nFintech and digitalisation can bring about enormous opportunities when the risk is properly managed. Leveraging earlier success in facilitating the uptake of Regtech, the HKMA, with the support of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority, published a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap in August 2023 to promote further development of fintech by financial institutions in five focus areas — Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We anticipate local regulators continuing to collaborate and work closely together with their industry sectors in the coming years in order for the Hong Kong financial industry as a whole to keep abreast and reap the benefits of dynamic fintech development.\n\n# Hong Kong as an IFC — The centre of action and innovation\n\nIn 2023, we fully emerged from the pandemic. Hong Kong was not only back in business but its position as one of the world’s leading IFCs was further underscored by the return of global investors and our strengthened global network. Domestically, we took the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the HKMA’s establishment to host a series of large-scale, international events with top-level participation from the global financial and banking community to demonstrate Hong Kong’s vibrancy and to send a clear message that Hong Kong as an IFC remained relevant and indispensable to global investors and financial institutions seeking growth and innovation. Of particular note was the return of the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, held in November, which attracted to our city more than 350 international and regional leaders from some 160 global financial institutions. Other high-powered events hosted in Hong Kong included a meeting of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and two HKMA-BIS Conferences which were among the largest gatherings of central bank governors and banking supervisors of the year. These events attest to the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nExternally, 2023 was also a year in which Hong Kong proactively reached out to strengthen its connections with traditional markets including the US and Europe, as well as new destinations such as those in the Middle East. We met with peer regulators and top management of global financial institutions in these markets to both apprise and update them on the opportunities in Hong Kong and the Mainland, while seeking out new collaboration opportunities for Hong Kong.\n\nTo complement these engagement efforts, we actively contributed to the work of international and regional forums by taking up certain leadership roles. During the year, I accepted invitations to chair the BIS Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies and to co-chair the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Regional Consultative Group for Asia. My colleagues are also chairing or co-chairing a number of other important groupings under the Basel Committee, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks, to name a few. The HKMA’s leadership at many regional and international forums is a recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and contribution to international central banking and regulatory efforts in the pursuit of global monetary and financial stability, as well as Hong Kong’s importance as an IFC.\n\nTo build on the above accomplishments, we must position ourselves as a forward-looking IFC, staying ahead of the curve to ensure our ongoing competitiveness. We have identified three long-term trends in the coming years that will shape our future: namely the continued opening-up of the Mainland, the development of green and sustainable finance and the deployment of fintech. We will continue to support the development of our financial markets to capture the opportunities from these long-term trends while positioning our financial platform to provide leading services to attract more businesses to Hong Kong.

{"en":"# Highlights of 2023\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy stages a positive growth in 2023, driven by revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continues to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remains moderate. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remains sound in 2023, supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. Asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nAmid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly trades on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone in 2023, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May. The Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remain stable, and continue to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the Linked Exchange Rate System. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has helped Hong Kong weather a succession of shocks and crises in the past four decades, demonstrating the system’s resilience and robustness.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA responds swiftly to the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of banks. In light of escalating cyber threats and increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also works closely with banks to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhances consumer protection on payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA works with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlines the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduces enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commences supervision of trust business. A pilot programme on consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart” is also launched.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring, enhanced information sharing between banks and with law enforcement agencies, intensified public education, and launched a new pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities have been advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nThe HKMA makes good progress on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure, and makes notable efforts in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector.\n\nThe HKMA also advances its work to ensure a credible resolution regime, including developing a new resolution standard on accessing critical financial market infrastructures, and completing a review on the implementation of loss-absorbing capacity policy standards.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe successful conclusion of the second Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference demonstrates the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA works closely with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland financial markets. This includes enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme, designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme, all of which are effective in solidifying Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nOn strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, notable progress is made in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make significant progress on various fronts of the “Fintech 2025” strategy. Project mBridge enters the Minimum Viable Product development phase, Phase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is completed, and Commercial Data Interchange sees increasing usage and the successful linkage with Government data source. Moreover, a new Fintech Promotion Roadmap is announced to further develop Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in the banking sector. Meanwhile, the Faster Payment System marks its fifth anniversary and continues to see expanded adoption and enhancements including new functionalities like the linkage with Thailand’s PromptPay for cross-border QR payment.

{"en":"# Priorities for 2024 and Beyond\n\nEntering 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue to recover at a moderate pace, riding on the ongoing revival of inbound tourism, public infrastructure projects and stable private consumption. However, the external environment is fraught with risks and uncertainties, especially those relating to the future US policy rate path, the global growth prospects, and the evolving geopolitical tensions. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to weather adverse shocks given its resilience and ample buffers built up over the years.\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, we will stay vigilant in the face of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, seeking to promptly identify emerging risks and respond to them in an agile manner. At the same time, we will seek opportunities and create policy headroom to help further enhance Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this challenging investment environment, we will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, taking defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# Stability and integrity of the financial system\n\nThe global economic uncertainties of recent years look set to continue in 2024. The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking into 2024, global financial markets could experience volatility as a result of uncertainties surrounding the US monetary policy outlook, evolving geopolitical risks, and an uneven global economic recovery. 2024 is also a key election year as many major elections are scheduled to be held across the world. The outcome of these elections could further increase market uncertainties. Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. The HKMA also has the capability, the resources and the commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue its efforts to closely monitor any risks and vulnerabilities arising in the domestic and external environments, and will deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. We will also conduct research into issues affecting the Hong Kong economy, assessing and addressing any potential risks associated with these issues.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical tensions across the world broke out while others remained unresolved, contributing to political uncertainty and instability that looks set to continue into 2024. Economic pressures in the form of high interest rates were a feature of the global landscape, and rates remain high entering 2024. Within the banking sector, the continued drive towards digitalisation and the implementation of new technology, including artificial intelligence, have brought many advantages but are also posing new operational and cyber security risks as well as supervisory challenges. In such a volatile political, economic and technological landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, we will continue to enhance and refine our banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account technological developments, changes in customer expectations, as well as international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit, liquidity and market risks\n\nIn light of the increasingly challenging macroeconomic landscape, a special focus of the HKMA will be on monitoring the asset quality of authorized institutions (AIs) and assessing the effectiveness of their credit risk management and controls, particularly with respect to loan classification and provisioning practices and problem loans management. We will also maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors with a view to ensuring that AIs are striking an appropriate balance between undertaking prudent credit risk management and fulfilling their financial intermediation function throughout economic cycles. In particular, we will follow up with banks through the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism on the nine new measures rolled out in March 2024 to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in obtaining financing from banks.\n\nUncertainties in the global economic outlook as well as elevated geopolitical tensions may increase the volatility of both asset prices and cross-border fund flows. The HKMA will make vigilance a priority, and will continue to effectively supervise the liquidity and market risk management of AIs.\n\n# Follow-up actions on lessons drawn from the 2023 banking turmoil\n\nThe HKMA will implement the follow-up actions identified in the internal review that it undertook in response to the 2023 banking turmoil in the US and Europe. These are actions that will further strengthen supervisory effectiveness and enhance its ability to handle a banking crisis should one arise. They include enhancing the risk capture of AIs’ interest rate risk in the banking book in the context of the HKMA’s supervisory review process, improving the preparedness of AIs for dealing with liquidity stresses given the continuing digitalisation of banking services, streamlining the HKMA’s crisis management processes, and further enhancing interagency and cross-border supervisory co-ordination.\n\n# Operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress towards achieving full compliance with the HKMA Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module OR-2 on “Operational Resilience”, and assess and benchmark banks’ tolerance limits for plausible disruptions, with a view to enhancing the overall resilience of the banking system. With respect to cyber risk, we will oversee a new round of self-assessments by AIs under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitor AIs’ implementation of a secure tertiary data backup to enhance their data recovery capabilities if faced with destructive cyber attacks.\n\nGiven the accelerating pace of digitalisation in banking operations, the HKMA will keep a close watch on emerging risks arising from the use of advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. We will also collaborate with banks and other relevant stakeholders in operating an agile and pre-emptive mechanism to counter the growing trend of digital fraud.\n\n# Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2024, to uphold the integrity of the banking system and build customer confidence, the HKMA will target high-risk areas and prioritise risk-based regulatory updates, including issuing guidance to support an effective, risk-based implementation of changes to requirements for politically exposed persons, and supporting the implementation of the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers. We will also issue guidance to help AIs optimise their transaction monitoring systems and to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence, and focus on controls targeting high-end money laundering through our thematic work. To strengthen the ecosystem response to digital fraud and reduce losses to victims, we will further consult the public and the industry on a proposal to expand the scope of bank-to-bank information sharing from corporate accounts to personal accounts and, based on the feedback received, pursue necessary legislative amendments. We will move to a full build of Macro Analytics 3.0 by pooling data relevant to anti-money laundering across multiple banks and interfacing this with existing ecosystem fraud analysis. This will deliver more rapid cross-bank responses and further enhance our datadriven anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism supervision, enabling us to take quicker, more decisive action against systemic money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n# Wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fundrelated businesses\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA will step up both its on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, investment products, and insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses. More specifically, we will focus on Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) business, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual asset (VA)-related products, long term insurance products and premium financing activities, taking into account the latest market developments as well as evolving international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will communicate closely with fellow regulators and the banking industry to provide guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products as appropriate. In particular, to support the sustainable and responsible development of the VA sector, we will continue to work with the Government and fellow regulators to ensure that the regulatory regime in place for the VA sector is robust, comprehensive and well-balanced.\n\nThe HKMA will facilitate and monitor the industry’s implementation of enhancements to Cross-boundary WMC, and continue to engage with the industry and relevant regulatory authorities in order to further enhance the scheme. We will also continue to work with fellow regulators and the industry to streamline the selling process for investment products, and will consolidate and clarify guidance, as appropriate, to facilitate industry compliance. In addition to trust business, we will also commence the supervision of new Type 13 regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for AIs providing depositary services for collective investment schemes authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which will come into operation on 2 October 2024.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA aims to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) and the various guidance issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). We will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise, and in other international working groups to discuss the implementation of new and innovative FMI-related initiatives. We will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, and will review and strengthen our oversight requirements as appropriate to reflect the latest international practices as well as market and technology developments.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strengthen and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) and the Banking (Disclosure) Rules (BDR) for implementing the Basel III final reform package (Final Package) are expected to take effect on 1 January 2025 following the passage of the amended Rules in the Legislative Council. In 2024, the HKMA will continue to prepare the supporting guidance, banking returns and standard disclosure templates and tables needed to facilitate the application of the Rules. In particular, we plan to:\n- consult the industry in the second quarter of 2024 on the revisions to the SPM module CA-B-3 on “Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB)–Geographic Allocation of Private Sector Credit Exposures” and Return MA(BS)25 “Quarterly reporting on the Countercyclical Capital Buffer”, reflecting the consequential changes arising from the implementation of the Final Package and the revised Return of International Banking Statistics; and\n- finalise the package for effecting the reporting-only requirement for the new standards on market and credit valuation adjustment risks, which starts on 1 July 2024.\n\nThose parts of the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules (BELR) and the Banking (Liquidity) Rules (BLR) that are largely consequential to the implementation of the Final Package under the amended BCR are also targeted to take effect on 1 January 2025. The HKMA plans to finalise the proposed consequential amendments to the related regulatory returns in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, with a new standard on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures and subsequent targeted revisions to the standard having been issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022 and December 2023 respectively, local implementation of the standard is planned for 2025. The HKMA will examine the need for potential legislative amendments to various sets of rules, including the BCR, the BDR, the BELR and the BLR, and conduct the statutory consultation on the necessary rule amendments in the first half of 2025.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nThe HKMA plans to update a number of SPM modules in response to lessons learned from the banking turmoil in the US and Europe of March 2023, as well as developments in regulatory requirements and international standards. These modules include:\n","zh":"# 二零二四年及未來發展重點\n\n踏入2024年，香港經濟預期將繼續以溫和步伐復甦，主要得益於來港旅遊持續復興、公共基礎設施項目以及穩健的私人消費。然而，外部環境充滿風險和不確定性，特別是與未來美國利率走向、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢有關。儘管如此，由於香港金融體系具備韌性，並多年來累積了充足的緩衝，使其仍能有效應對不利衝擊。\n\n香港金融管理局非常重視維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，我們將密切關注不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，力求及早識別新興風險並以靈活的方式作出應對。與此同時，我們也會尋找機遇，並創造政策空間，以進一步提升香港作為國際金融中心的領先地位。在充滿挑戰的投資環境下管理外匯基金時，我們將繼續審慎投資，同時保持彈性，適時採取防禦性措施，並維持高度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定及健全\n\n近幾年全球經濟的不確定性預計將持續至2024年。香港金融管理局將密切關注最新發展，並對潛在風險保持警惕，以維護金融體系的韌性和穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警惕\n\n展望2024年，全球金融市場可能因美國貨幣政策前景不明、地緣政治風險演變以及全球經濟復甦不均等因素而出現波動。2024年也是一個重要的選舉年，世界各地將舉行多項重大選舉。這些選舉的結果可能會進一步增加市場的不確定性。然而，憑藉其韌性和多年來累積的緩衝，香港金融體系已具備充分的準備，能夠抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦具備能力、資源和決心，以維護香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續密切監察來自本地及海外環境的任何風險和脆弱性，並會在必要時採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。我們亦會研究影響香港經濟的議題，評估及處理與這些議題相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 維持銀行體系穩定\n\n二零二三年，全球各地爆發新的地緣政治緊張局勢，而一些舊的衝突仍未解決，這加劇了政治不確定性和動盪，預計這種情況將延續至二零二四年。高利率成為全球經濟環境的一大特點，並在進入二零二四年時仍然居高不下。在銀行業方面，持續推動數位化及採用新科技，包括人工智能，雖然帶來了許多優勢，但也帶來了新的營運和網絡安全風險，以及監管方面的挑戰。面對如此動盪的政治、經濟和科技環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊。與此同時，我們將繼續完善和優化銀行監管和政策框架，並納入科技發展、客戶期望的變化以及國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性與市場風險\n\n鑒於宏觀經濟形勢日趨複雜，金管局將特別關注認可金融機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理及控制的成效，尤其在貸款分類、提備及不良貸款管理方面。我們亦會與銀行及商業界別保持緊密溝通，以確保認可金融機構在整個經濟週期內，能夠在審慎的信貸風險管理與履行金融中介功能之間取得適當平衡。具體而言，我們將透過銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，跟進於2024年3月推出的九項新措施，協助中小企業從銀行獲得融資。\n\n全球經濟前景不明朗以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇，可能會增加資產價格和跨境資金流動的波動性。金管局會將保持警惕作為首要任務，並將繼續有效監察認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 後續行動：汲取2023年銀行動盪的經驗教訓\n\n香港金融管理局將會落實其因應去年美國及歐洲銀行動盪而進行的內部審檢討中識別的後續行動。這些行動將進一步加強監管效能，並提升金融管理局應對銀行危機的能力。具體措施包括：在香港金融管理局的監管審查過程中，加強對認可機構銀行帳簿利率風險的風險捕捉；鑑於銀行服務持續數碼化，提升認可機構應對流動性壓力的準備；精簡香港金融管理局的危機管理流程；以及進一步加強跨機構及跨境監管協調。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n香港金融管理局將會繼續監察認可的機構在符合金管局《監理政策手冊》OR-2 模組「運營韌性」方面的進展，並評估和對標各銀行在合理可信擾亂情況下的容忍限額，以提升銀行體系整體韌性。 關於網絡風險，我們將會監察認可的機構根據《網絡韌性評估框架》2.0 進行新一輪的自我評估，並監察它們實施安全的第三層數據備份，以提升在面對破壞性網絡攻擊時的數據恢復能力。\n\n鑒於銀行營運數碼化步伐日益加快，金管局將密切監察生成式人工智能和分布式賬本技術等先進技術帶來的潛在風險。我們亦會與銀行和其他相關持份者合作，運作一個具彈性及預防性的機制，以應對日益猖獗的數碼詐欺趨勢。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n二零二四年，為維護銀行體系健全及提升客戶信心，金管局將鎖定高風險領域，並優先處理基於風險的監管更新，包括發佈指引以支持有效、基於風險的政治敏感人士合規要求變更的實施，以及支持穩定幣發行商監管制度的落實。我們亦會發佈指引協助人工智能優化交易監控系統，並促進人工智能的負責任使用，以及透過主題工作，加強針對高端洗錢活動的控制。為強化生態系統對數碼欺詐的應對，並減少對受害者的損失，我們將進一步諮詢公眾及業界，就擴大銀行間資訊共享範圍，由企業戶擴展至個人戶的建議徵求意見，並根據收到的意見，推行必要的立法修訂。我們將透過匯集跨多間銀行反洗錢相關數據，並將其與現有生態系統欺詐分析系統連接，全面構建反洗錢分析系統3.0。這將可實現更快速的跨銀行應對，並進一步提升我們以數據驅動的反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資監管，使我們能夠對系統性洗錢及恐怖融資風險採取更迅速、更果斷的行動。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務\n\n二零二四年，香港金融管理局將加強對人工智能在財富管理、證券、投資產品、保險以及強積金（MPF）相關業務中行為的實地檢查和場外監察。具體而言，我們將重點關注跨境財富管理通（跨境WMC）業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產（VA）相關產品、長期保險產品以及保費融資活動，並會參考最新的市場發展以及不斷演變的國際標準。\n\n香港金融管理局會與其他監管機構及銀行業界保持緊密溝通，並於適當時候就投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準提供指引。尤其在支持虛擬資產領域可持續及負責任的發展方面，我們將繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保虛擬資產領域的監管制度健全、全面且平衡。\n\n香港金融管理局將會促進和監察業界實施跨境結算服務的優化措施，並將繼續與業界及相關監管機構保持聯繫，以進一步提升該計劃。我們亦會繼續與其他監管機構和業界合作，簡化投資產品的銷售流程，並會在適當情況下整合和澄清指引，以便利業界遵守規定。除了信託業務外，我們亦將於二零二四年十月二日開始，根據《證券及期貨條例》對為證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）認可的集體投資計劃提供存管服務的人工智能的新第十三類受規管活動進行監管。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局旨在根據《支付系統及結算設施條例》（PSSVFO）、金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI）以及支付與市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發出的各項指引，促進其監管下的金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的安全和效率。我們將繼續參與CPMI-IOSCO1 PFMI實施監察及評估工作，並參與其他國際工作小組，討論實施新的及創新的FMIs相關倡議。我們亦會參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並會根據最新的國際慣例以及市場和科技發展，適時檢討和加強我們的監管要求。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續加強和完善其銀行監理及規管框架和政策，並會參考國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾協議\n\n預期銀行（資本）規則（BCR）及銀行（披露）規則（BDR）的修訂案，以落實巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案（最終方案），將於立法會通過修訂案後，於2025年1月1日生效。金融管理局將於2024年繼續準備支援指引、銀行報告表以及標準披露範本和表格，以方便應用該等規則。具體而言，我們計劃：\n- 在2024年第二季就SPM模組CA-B-3「逆周期資本緩衝（CCyB）– 私營部門信貸風險的地域分配」及報告表MA(BS)25「逆周期資本緩衝季度報告」的修訂，諮詢業界，以反映最終方案實施及國際銀行統計報告表修訂所帶來的後續變動；以及\n- 完成一套機制，以實施自2024年7月1日起生效的新市場及信用價值調整風險報告要求。\n\n修訂銀行（風險限額）規則（BELR）及銀行（流動性）規則（BLR）的擬議修訂部分，主要為配合經修訂銀行條例下的最終方案的實施而產生的後續影響，預計亦將於2025年1月1日生效。金管局計劃於2024年完成相關監管報告的後續修訂。\n\n與此同時，巴塞爾銀行監理委員會已於2022年12月及2023年12月分別發佈關於銀行加密資產風險審慎處理的新標準及後續的針對性修訂，本地計劃於2025年實施該標準。香港金融管理局將會檢視修訂《銀行業條例》、《銀行業規例》、《銀行業貸款及認購規定》及《銀行業行為準則》等各套規則所需的潛在立法修訂，並於2025年上半年就必要的規則修訂展開法定諮詢。\n\n# 其他監督政策及風險管理指引\n\n香港金融管理局計劃根據今年三月美國及歐洲銀行動盪事件中汲取的經驗，以及監管要求和國際標準的發展，更新多個「強積計劃」模組，其中包括：\n"}

{"en":"# Corporate Governance\n\nAs Hong Kong’s central banking institution, the HKMA is committed to high standards of corporate governance, as good governance is crucial in maintaining and safeguarding the trust and confidence of the public in the HKMA to fulfil its statutory mandate.\n\nTo achieve its commitment to good corporate governance, the HKMA:\n- puts in place a well-defined governance structure with a high degree of accountability;\n- exercises robust controls to manage risks and ensure that staff behaviours at all levels and its day-to-day operations are consistent with specified standards; and\n- pursues a policy of high transparency and accessibility, and keeps close contacts with stakeholders.\n\n# The HKMA and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\n\nThe HKMA is an integral part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, but is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service in order to attract personnel of the right experience and expertise. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and his staff are public officers. In its day-to-day work, the HKMA operates with a high degree of autonomy within the relevant statutory powers conferred upon, or delegated to, the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong: a letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority dated 25 June 2003 specifies that these should be currency stability defined as a stable exchange value at around HK$7.80 to one US dollar maintained by Currency Board arrangements. The Monetary Authority is on his own responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments and operational means for doing so. The Monetary Authority also has responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, assisted by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has responsibility for policies for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system and the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. In support of these policies, the Monetary Authority’s responsibilities include:\n- promoting the general stability and effective working of the banking system;\n- promoting the development of the debt market, in co-operation with other relevant bodies;\n- matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins;\n- promoting the safety and efficiency of the financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems and, where appropriate, the operation of these systems; and\n- seeking to promote, in co-operation with other relevant bodies, confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, and market development initiatives to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority, under delegation from the Financial Secretary, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use of the Exchange Fund, and for the investment management of the Fund.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nThe autonomy given to the HKMA in its day-to-day operations, and in the methods it uses to pursue policy objectives determined by the Government, is complemented by a high degree of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe HKMA serves Hong Kong by promoting monetary and banking stability, by managing the official reserves effectively, and by developing and overseeing a robust and diverse financial infrastructure. These processes help to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and to foster Hong Kong’s economic well-being.\n\nThe HKMA must have the confidence of the community if it is to perform its duties well. The HKMA therefore takes seriously the duty of explaining its policies and work to the general public and makes every effort to address any concerns within the community relevant to the HKMA’s responsibilities. In particular, the HKMA makes timely clarifications on misinformation and rumours about the HKMA’s policies via traditional and social media.\n\nThe HKMA is accountable to the people of Hong Kong through the Financial Secretary, who appoints the Monetary Authority, and through the laws passed by the Legislative Council that set out the Monetary Authority’s powers and responsibilities. The HKMA also recognises a broader responsibility to promote a better understanding of its roles and objectives and to keep itself informed of community concerns. In its day-to-day operations and in its wider contacts with the community, the HKMA pursues a policy of transparency and accessibility. This policy has two main objectives:\n- to keep the financial industry and the public as fully informed about the work of the HKMA as possible, subject to considerations of market sensitivity, commercial confidentiality and statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information; and\n- to ensure that the HKMA is in touch with, and responsive to, the community it serves.\n\nThe HKMA seeks to follow international best practices in its transparency arrangements. It maintains extensive relations with the mass media and produces a range of regular and special publications in both English and Chinese. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) carries a large number of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches and presentations, in addition to dedicated sections on research, statistics, regulatory resources, consumer information and other topics. Social media platforms are also used to communicate with the public more efficiently in the digital era. The HKMA maintains an Information Centre at its offices, consisting of a library and an exhibition area, which is open to the public six days a week. Further information on the HKMA’s work on public communications and engagement is contained in the Corporate Functions chapter on pages 185 to 193.\n\nOver the years, the HKMA has progressively increased the detail and frequency of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board Accounts. Since 1999, the HKMA has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard project for central banks. The HKMA publishes records of meetings of the Currency Board Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and the reports on Currency Board operations. The supervisory policies and guidelines on banking have been published on the HKMA website since 1996.\n\nThe relations between the HKMA and the Legislative Council play an important part in promoting accountability and transparency. There is a formal commitment from the Chief Executive of the HKMA to appear before the Panel on Financial Affairs of the Legislative Council three times a year to brief Members and to answer questions on the HKMA’s work. Representatives from the HKMA attend Legislative Council panel and committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues and to assist Members in their scrutiny of draft legislation.\n\n# Controls\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust internal and external control mechanisms to ensure that it upholds a high standard of staff conduct, prudent risk management as well as appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nA Code of Conduct, which provides guidance to staff on their ethical and legal responsibilities, is in place to ensure that staff behaviours are consistent with specified standards at all levels.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operational controls\n\nAll departments and divisions have ownership and responsibility to identify and assess risks of their operational processes and put in place appropriate controls for ensuring proper day-to-day operations of the HKMA.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nDespite a challenging external environment, the Hong Kong economy staged a positive growth in 2023, thanks to the revivals in inbound tourism and domestic demand. The labour market continued to improve alongside the economic recovery, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets remained soft amid tightened financial conditions and weak market sentiment. Economic activities for 2024 are expected to recover further at a moderate pace, although the outlook is clouded by multiple external uncertainties.\n\n# The economy in review\n\n# Real activities\n\nHaving navigated through the severe challenges posed by the pandemic in the previous year, the Hong Kong economy grew steadily by 3.2% in 2023 (Table 1 and Chart 1). Domestically, private consumption recovered notably on the back of improved labour market conditions and various support initiatives introduced by the Government, such as the Consumption Voucher Scheme and a series of promotional campaigns. Despite tightened financial conditions, overall investment expenditure registered significant growth against a low base of comparison from the previous year. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of services rebounded, due mainly to the robust revival of inbound tourism. However, their positive impact on growth was more than offset by the strong recovery in outbound tourism, which was measured as imports of services. On the other hand, exports of goods remained lacklustre amid weak external demand, and put a drag on Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflation remained moderate in 2023 as external price pressures gradually eased, while domestic cost pressures remained broadly in check despite rising slightly as the economy recovered (Chart 2)1. For 2023 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates were 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions improved further in 2023, with the unemployment rate falling to a decade-low level of 2.8% in July and hovering at a low level for the remaining months of the year2 (Chart 3). Both labour demand and labour supply increased, as reflected respectively by the pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and in the labour force. In view of Hong Kong’s manpower shortages, the Government rolled out various labour importation schemes3 and talent attraction initiatives4 in 2023. Meanwhile, with tight labour market conditions, the year-on-year growth rates of nominal wages and of labour earnings increased gradually towards their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nAfter stabilising in early 2023, the local stock market turned sluggish in the second half. Extending its rebound in late 2022, the Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high daily close of 22,689 on 27 January 2023. It then retreated and dropped further to low levels by December (Chart 4), reflecting weak market sentiment due to the banking sector problems in the US and Switzerland in March, as well as weaker global economic prospects and tightened financial conditions in the second half. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 17,047, down notably by 13.8% from the end of 2022, and marking the fourth consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market experienced a rebound in the first four months of 2023 on the back of the resumption of normalcy in the Mainland and Hong Kong, but softened subsequently alongside rising mortgage rates5 and weak market sentiment. Overall, housing prices dropped by 6.9% year on year in 2023, while housing transactions further declined by 4.5% to a record-low of 43,002 units. Housing affordability remained stretched despite improving slightly along with the downward adjustment of housing prices. Similarly, the non-residential property markets continued to face headwinds, with prices of offices, retail premises and flatted factories softened further. The rentals for offices remained under pressure due to high vacancy rates amid the increasing prevalence of work-from-home arrangements and large supply. On the other hand, the rentals for retail premises increased in 2023 with the revival of inbound tourism and the improvement in private consumption.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Outlook for the economy\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong economy is expected to continue its recovery at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism is set to expand further alongside the continuous improvement in handling capacity and the Government’s effort to promote mega events, while local consumption activities should be supported by a steady labour market. The various infrastructure projects to be taken forward by the Government will also lend support to the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s exports of goods will likely stabilise alongside the expected upturn in the global technology cycle. The Government forecasts real GDP to grow steadily by 2.5% –3.5% in 20246. However, the outlook is clouded by multiple risks and uncertainties, including those stemming from the US policy rate path, the pace of technology cycle recovery, the prospects for global economic growth, and evolving geopolitical tensions.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain mild in 2024, with softened external price pressures helping to offset the upward pressures on domestic costs amid further economic recovery and rising housing rentals. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.1% in 2024, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. On the other hand, the labour market is expected to be supported by the ongoing economic recovery, while the various labour importation and talent attraction schemes will continue to help alleviate manpower shortages across different industries.\n\n# Performance of the banking sector\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong banking sector faced a number of challenges including a high interest rate environment, heightened volatility in global financial markets caused by the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, and a slowerthan-expected economic recovery in the Mainland and Hong Kong. Despite these multiple headwinds, the Hong Kong banking sector remained sound and continued to be supported by strong capital and liquidity buffers. The asset quality of the banking sector remained healthy despite an increase in the classified loan ratio. The profitability of banks improved notably, driven by higher net interest income.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe classified loan ratio of the banking sector rose to 1.56% at the end of 2023 from 1.40% at the end of 2022, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio increasing to 1.24% from 0.85% during the same period (Chart 5). The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending also rose to 2.58% at the end of 2023 from 2.26% a year before. The increase in the classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades of exposures to Mainland property developers. Nevertheless, the provisions set aside by banks remained sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e.  total provisions to classified loans) stood at 75% at the end of 2023. If the market value of collateral held against the classified loans is taken into account, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would reach around 145%. Meanwhile, the delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low, at 0.08% and 0.30% respectively, at the end of 2023 (Chart 6).\n\nChart 5 Asset quality of the banking sector\nNote: Figures cover Hong Kong offices, overseas branches and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 6 Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe banking sector recorded notable profit growth in 2023. The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks increased by 62.1% in the year, while the post-tax return on average assets rose to 0.89% from 0.57% during the same period (Chart 7). The improvement in profit was predominantly the result of an increase in net interest income (+30%), coupled with a significant gain in investments held for trading in 2023 as compared to a mild loss in the previous year. This was partly offset by an increase in loan impairment charges (+28%), as specific provisions were set aside for new classified loans. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates, the net interest margin of retail banks widened to 1.68% in 2023 from 1.31% a year before (Chart 8). Meanwhile, retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio fell to 38.8% in 2023 from 48.0% in 2022 (Chart 9).\n\nChart 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 8 Retail banks’ net interest margin\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 9 Retail banks’ cost-to-income ratio\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 0.9% in 2023, as growths in negotiable debt instruments held (+8.6%) and interbank lending (+4.4%) were mostly offset by a decline in total loans. Given the subdued loan demand amid higher borrowing costs and a weakened global economic outlook, total loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023. Of the total loans, loans for use in Hong Kong remained broadly stable (-0.4%), while loans for use outside Hong Kong and trade finance decreased by 10.4% and 13.1% respectively. Mainlandrelated lending fell by 6.6% in 2023.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 5.1% in 2023, compared with a growth of 1.7% in 2022. As total loans declined while total deposits grew, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 62.8% at the end of 2023 from 68.5% a year before (Chart 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised in 2023. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 21.1% at the end of 2023, compared with 20.1% a year before. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.9% (Chart 11). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2023 (Chart 12).\n\nChart 10 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 11 Consolidated capital ratios of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 12 Consolidated leverage ratio of locally incorporated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity conditions\n\nThe banking sector continued to maintain a strong liquidity position. The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions was 178.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 65.7% (Chart 13). The main source of funding for the banking sector continued to be customer deposits. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions and the Core Funding Ratio (CFR) of category 2A institutions were 144.4% and 169.4% respectively at the end of 2023 (Chart 14). All four ratios were well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nChart 13 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n\nChart 14 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n儘管外圍環境充滿挑戰，香港經濟在二零二三年仍錄得正增長，主要得益於來港旅遊的復甦以及本地需求的增加。 隨着經濟復甦，勞動力市場持續改善，而通脹率保持溫和。 在收緊的金融狀況和疲弱的市場情緒影響下，資產市場仍然低迷。 預期二零二四年經濟活動將會進一步以溫和的速度恢復，但前景仍受到多項外圍不確定因素的影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n經歷了去年疫情帶來的嚴峻挑戰後，香港經濟在2023年穩步增長3.2%（表1及圖1）。本地方面，在勞動市場狀況改善以及政府推出各項支援措施（例如消費券計劃和一系列推廣活動）的支持下，私人消費顯著回升。儘管金融狀況收緊，整體投資支出較去年低迷的比較基礎顯著增長。對外方面，香港的服務出口因入境旅遊的強勁復甦而反彈。然而，其對經濟增長的正面影響被強勁的出境旅遊所抵消，後者以服務進口來衡量。另一方面，在外部需求疲軟的情況下，商品出口表現疲弱，並拖累了香港的國內生產總值（GDP）增長。\n\n圖表 1 按貢獻度劃分的實際國內生產總值增長\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處\n\n表1 按支出分項的實際國內生產總值增長率（環比）\n註：季節性調整後，固定資產總形成價值的季變率數據不可得。\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2023年本地通脹維持溫和，隨着外部價格壓力逐漸緩解，儘管經濟復甦導致成本略有上升，但整體而言，內需成本壓力大致受到控制（圖表2）1。2023年全年，核心及整體通脹率分別為1.7%及2.1%。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2023年勞動市場狀況進一步改善，失業率在7月降至十年來低位的2.8%，其後全年維持在低水平（圖表3）。 勞動力需求和勞動力供應均有增加，分別體現在總就業人數的增長（圖表3）和勞動力的增長。 鑒於香港存在勞動力短缺問題，政府於2023年推出多項輸入勞工計劃及人才吸引措施。與此同時，在勞動力市場供不應求的情況下，名義工資和勞工收入的按年增長率逐漸回升至疫情前水平。\n\n圖表 2 潛在消費者物價膨脹\n\n圖表三 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處\n\n# 股票市場\n\n在2023年初趨於穩定後，本地股市在下半年表現疲軟。 恆生指數延續2022年末的反彈勢頭，於2023年1月27日收報22,689點，創下年度新高。 隨後，指數回落並進一步下滑，至12月跌至低位（圖表4），反映出因3月份美國及瑞士銀行業問題，以及下半年全球經濟前景轉弱和金融狀況收緊而導致的市場情緒低迷。 恆生指數以17,047點收盤，較2022年底顯著下跌13.8%，並連續第四年下跌。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n受惠於內地及香港恢復正常運作，住宅物業市場在2023年首四個月出現反彈，但隨後因按揭利率上升及市場情緒疲弱而回軟。整體而言，2023年樓價較去年下跌6.9%，房屋交易量進一步下降4.5%，創下歷史新低43,002個單位。儘管樓價下調有所改善，但房屋負擔能力仍然吃緊。與此同時，非住宅物業市場持續面對逆風，辦公室、零售舖位及工業大廈的價格進一步下跌。由於居家辦公安排日益普及及供應量大增，辦公室租金持續受壓。另一方面，受入境旅遊復甦及私人消費改善帶動，零售舖位租金在2023年有所上升。\n\n圖表 4 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部與香港交易所有限公司\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2024年香港經濟將繼續以溫和步伐復甦。隨著處理能力不斷提升，以及政府積極推廣大型活動，入境旅遊預計將進一步擴展，本地消費活動則應受到穩定的勞工市場支持。政府將推行的各項基礎設施項目亦將為經濟提供支撐。與此同時，隨著全球科技週期預期回升，香港商品出口可能將趨於穩定。政府預測2024年實質本地生產總值將穩步增長2.5%至3.5%。然而，美國利率政策走向、科技週期復甦速度、全球經濟增長前景以及不斷演變的地緣政治緊張局勢等種種風險和不確定性，為前景蒙上陰影。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n預計2024年本地通脹將保持溫和，外部價格壓力減弱有助於抵消經濟進一步復甦及租金上漲對本地成本帶來的向上壓力。市場普遍預測2024年的整體通脹率為2.1%，而政府則預測整體及核心通脹率分別為2.4%及1.7%。另一方面，隨著經濟持續復甦，勞動力市場預期將獲得支持，而各項輸入勞工及人才吸引計劃將繼續有助於緩解各行各業的人手短缺問題。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n於二零二三年，香港銀行業面對多重挑戰，包括高利率環境、三月份美國及歐洲銀行動盪引發的全球金融市場波動加劇，以及內地及香港經濟復甦步伐未如預期。儘管如此，香港銀行業仍然穩健，並持續受到強大的資本及流動資金緩衝的支撐。銀行業的資產質素保持良好，即使不良貸款比率有所上升。銀行盈利能力顯著改善，主要受惠於淨利息收入增加。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n銀行業不良貸款比率於2023年底上升至1.56%，較2022年底的1.40%為高，而逾期及重組貸款比率亦由同期的0.85%上升至1.24%（圖表5）。與中國大陸相關的貸款不良貸款比率亦由前一年的2.26%上升至2023年底的2.58%。不良貸款比率上升主要由於對中國大陸房地產開發商的風險評級下調所致。儘管如此，銀行已計提足夠的撥備。撥備覆蓋率（即撥備總額對不良貸款的比率）於2023年底為75%。若將不良貸款的抵押品市值計算在內，調整後的撥備覆蓋率將達到約145%。與此同時，住宅按揭貸款和信用卡貸款的違約率在2023年底仍然偏低，分別為0.08%和0.30%（圖表6）。\n\n圖表 5 銀行業資產素質\n註：數據涵蓋香港辦事處、海外分行及主要海外子公司。\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖表6：住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的壞賬比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n銀行業於2023年錄得顯著的盈利增長。零售銀行在年度內的總稅前經營利潤增長了62.1%，而經稅後平均資產回報率從去年的0.57%上升至0.89%（圖表7）。盈利改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+30%），以及2023年持作交易投資的收益較前一年輕微虧損大幅增加。然而，貸款減值損失增加（+28%）在一定程度上抵消了這一利好，原因是針對新增不良貸款作出了特別撥備。在利率上升的背景下，零售銀行的淨利息息差在2023年擴大至1.68%，較前一年1.31%有所提升（圖表8）。與此同時，零售銀行的成本收入比從2022年的48.0%降至2023年的38.8%（圖表9）。\n\n圖表 7 零售銀行表現\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表 8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表9 零售銀行成本收入比\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業資產負債表於2023年增長0.9%，主要原因是持有之有價證券（增長8.6%）及銀行同業拆借（增長4.4%）的增長，被整體貸款減少所抵銷。 鑑於借貸成本上升及全球經濟前景疲弱，貸款需求疲軟，整體貸款於2023年減少3.6%。 在整體貸款中，用於香港的貸款大致保持穩定（減少0.4%），而用於香港以外地區的貸款及貿易融資分別減少10.4%及13.1%。 與中國大陸相關的貸款於2023年下降6.6%。\n\n負債方面，2023年總存款增長5.1%，較2022年的1.7%增長率為高。由於總貸款減少而總存款增加，整體貸款存款比率在2023年底下降至62.8%，較一年前的68.5%有所降低（圖表10）。\n\n# 資本適足性\n\n銀行業於2023年保持充足的資本。本地註冊認可機構（銀行）的合併總資本充足比率於2023年底為21.1%，較一年前的20.1%為高。一級資本比率為18.9%（圖表11）。兩項比率均遠高於各自的國際最低要求。巴塞爾協議III下的槓桿比率於2023年底為7.9%（圖表12）。\n\n圖表十 銀行業貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖表11 本地公司人工智能機構的綜合資本比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖表12 本地註冊人工智能機構的綜合槓桿比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行業持續維持穩健的流動性狀況。2023年第四季，第一類金融機構的平均流動性涵蓋比率（LCR）為178.6%，第二類金融機構的平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為65.7%（圖表13）。銀行業的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。在2023年末，第一類金融機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）以及第二A類金融機構的核心資金比率（CFR）分別為144.4%和169.4%（圖表14）。所有四項比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖表 13 指定人工智能的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n\n圖表 14 指定人工智能的資金比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nIn 2023, amid market expectations of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone, with the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking being triggered eight times between mid-February and early May.  The Hong Kong dollar had regained some momentum since May and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end.  Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, which marked its 40th anniversary in 2023, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates generally track their US dollar counterparts, while also being affected by local supply and demand.  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to various external shocks time after time.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1.  The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks;\n- Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation;\n- The Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at HK$7.75 (or HK$7.85) per US dollar when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates, helping move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAmid the market expectation of a “high for longer” US policy rate, the Hong Kong dollar remained soft and mostly traded on the weak side of the Convertibility Zone throughout 2023.  The weak-side CU was triggered eight times from mid-February to early May.  The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate regained some strength during early May to July, partly driven by dividend payment-related demand from listed companies and half-year-end funding needs by corporates. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar was mainly driven by the changes in local funding demands, such as buying flows through the Southbound Stock Connect, and traded around the central parity rate of 7.8 at year end (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market continued to function normally throughout 2023.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2023\n\nFrom February to May, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$51.5 billion at the weak-side CU at the request of banks in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS).  Reflecting the triggering of the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance decreased from HK$96.3 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$45.0 billion at the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,200.4 billion to HK$1,245.5 billion during the year. The total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs therefore declined from HK$1,296.7 billion at the end of 2022 to HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 (Chart 2). The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2023\n\n# Money market\n\nUnder the LERS, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) generally track their US dollar counterparts.  As the US continued to raise interest rates in the first seven months of 2023, the HIBORs generally rose (Chart 3).  For the year as a whole, the overnight, 1-month and 3-month HIBORs increased respectively by 286, 92 and 16 basis points to 6.09%, 5.27% and 5.15% at year end.\n\nFollowing the increases in the target range for the US federal funds rate, the Base Rate was adjusted upwards four times by a total of one percentage point (i.e. 100 basis points) from 4.75% to 5.75%.1 On the retail front, following the US policy rate hikes, many banks raised their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early May and another 12.5 basis points in late July.  Some banks also increased the cap on HIBOR-based mortgage rates of newly approved mortgage loans during the year, and the average interest rate of new mortgage loans rose from 3.35% in 2022 to 4.13% in December 2023.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing increased to HK$38.8 billion in 2023 from HK$8.4 billion in 2022 and no abnormality was noted in the relevant usage.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in 2023\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for four decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the US interest rate path and global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2023 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been ensured by a transparent set of rules, large fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress testing results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of the Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) rose from 110.12% at the end of 2022 to a high of 112.71% on 4 May 2023, surpassing the Upper Trigger Level of 112.5% (Chart 4).  This largely reflected the contraction in the Aggregate Balance as a result of the triggering of the weak-side CU in the first half of the year2. In accordance with the arrangement approved by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and as a result of the redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, assets were transferred out of the Backing Portfolio to the Investment Portfolio to reduce the Backing Ratio to around 109.97% on 8 May.  Thereafter, the Backing Ratio rose steadily to close at 110.73% on 31 December.  Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2023\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2023, the CBC considered issues including the May 2022 stablecoin market crash, the transmission of Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity backstop measures to banks in Hong Kong, and the recent movements in the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nThe below table summarises the value of the notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023:\n\nChart 5 Banknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2023\n\nChart 6 Distribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 7 Banknotes in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 8 Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\nChart 9 Breakdown of Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation at the end of 2023\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA continued to organise seminars on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes for bank tellers, cashiers from retail establishments and students to help enhance their knowledge and skills in authenticating banknotes.  During 2023, 15 seminars were arranged for around 3,000 participants.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainable HKMA chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme operated smoothly.  At the end of 2023, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at around HK$1,255.4 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of EFBNs\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)3, the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance, published 20 working papers and held 17 seminars\/ webinars on monetary and financial research topics that are of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The HKIMR also published six eJournals on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) to disseminate research outputs to SSRN’s global research community.  Moreover, to provide the public with a high-level, non-technical summary of the recently published working papers, the HKIMR published two issues of Insights from Monetary Research.\n\nApart from its research activities, the HKIMR organised four international events, one roundtable and four seminars\/ webinars with academia, global central banks and international financial institutions to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial issues:\n\n# 9 Mar\n\nA seminar on China’s Rebound: Recent Developments and Outlook by Dr Steven Alan Barnett, Senior Resident Representative in China of the IMF, and Dr Phakawa Jeasakul, Resident Representative for People’s Republic of China – Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the IMF, was held. Dr Barnett shared his views on the latest developments in the Chinese economy, as well as short- and medium-term issues that need to be addressed. More than 100 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 17 Apr\n\nA seminar on Navigating Through a Challenging World was held. Four experts from the IMF shared their views on the analytical chapters of the most recent issues of World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report by the IMF. Over 50 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 25 Apr\n\nA seminar with the presentation of the IMF’s April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report titled Safeguarding Global Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Interest Rates by Dr Jason Wu, Assistant Director, and Mr Thomas Pointek, Senior Financial Sector Expert, of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department was held. More than 80 participants attended the seminar.\n\n# 2 May\n\nA fireside chat on Asia in a Challenging World was hosted between Mr Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, and Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Mr Srinivasan outlined the key messages of the recent IMF Regional Economic Outlook report for Asia and shared his views on the key drivers and risks of the global and regional economy. In addition, the dialogue covered many important issues concerning the regional economy and the evolution of the international monetary system. Around 120 participants attended the event.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n於2023年，在市場預期美國利率將「高位維持更長時間」的情況下，港元主要於可兌換約束區間弱方交易，並在二月中至五月初期間八次觸及弱方兌換承諾。自五月起，港元已恢復部分動能，並在年底時於7.8的中心匯率附近交易。在於2023年慶祝40週年的聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息利率大致追隨其美元對應利率，同時亦受本地供求影響。整體而言，香港的匯率及貨幣市場保持穩定，並以暢順有序的方式運作。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一次又一次地展現了其抵禦各種外部衝擊的實力與韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元在外的匯價穩定，即在港元與美元的匯率於外匯市場內，維持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元之間。 貨幣制度的結構以聯繫匯率制度為特色，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有100%的美元儲備於外匯基金作支持，而貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n- 債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保；\n- 政府發行的在流通中的紙幣和硬幣；\n- 結算餘額總和，即銀行於金管局所持的結算戶餘額總計；以及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的交換基金票據和儲蓄券。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，仰賴自動調整利率機制的運作，以及香港金融管理局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）。當強方或弱方承諾被觸發時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求，以每美元7.75港元或7.85港元價格買入或賣出港元，從而擴大或縮減結餘，以壓低或提高港元利率，協助港元匯率重回7.75至7.85的聯繫匯率區間。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在美國利率「高且維持較長時間」的市場預期下，香港元在2023年全年維持偏弱走勢，且主要在可兌換約束區間的弱邊交易。由二月中至五月初期間，共有八次觸及弱邊兌換約束。香港元匯率在五月初至七月間一度回升，部分原因是受上市公司的股息支付需求及企業上半年度資金需求的帶動。此後，香港元主要受本地資金需求變化影響，例如透過滬港通（南向）的買入資金流動，並在年底於7.8的中心價附近交易（圖1）。總體而言，香港元外匯市場在2023年全年持續正常運作。\n\n圖表 1：2023年市場匯率\n\n二月至五月期間，應銀行要求，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度的設計，共購入了515億港元的弱方兌換。反映弱方兌換觸發，結餘由2022年末的963億港元下降至2023年末的450億港元。同時，於年內未償還的交易所基金票據略微增加，由12004億港元增至12455億港元。因此，結餘與未償還交易所基金票據總額由2022年末的12967億港元下降至2023年末的12904億港元（圖表2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然完全以外匯儲備支持。\n\n圖表 2：2023年綜合結餘（未扣除再貼現窗口）及未償還之交換基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n根據聯營銀行體系貸款（LERS），香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）通常會追隨其美元同業拆息的走勢。由於美國在2023年首七個月持續加息，香港銀行同業拆息也普遍上升（圖表3）。截至全年，隔夜、1個月及3個月的香港銀行同業拆息分別上升286個、92個及16個基點，至年底的6.09%、5.27%及5.15%。\n\n隨着美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的調升，基準利率共調高四次，總計一厘（即100個基點），由4.75%升至5.75%。¹ 在零售方面，美國政策利率調升後，多家銀行在五月初及七月下旬分別調高最優惠貸款利率12.5個基點。部分銀行在年內亦調升了以HIBOR為基礎的新批准按揭貸款的利率上限，新按揭貸款的平均利率由2022年的3.35%上升至2023年12月的4.13%。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作維持正常。2023年再貼現窗口借款增加至388億港元，較2022年的84億港元為高，相關使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖表三：二零二三年香港銀行同業拆息利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度在過去四十年一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並已展現出其應對挑戰的實力和韌性。儘管美國利率走向及全球經濟復甦仍存在不明朗因素，但港元匯率及貨幣市場運作仍然有序，充分反映了聯匯制度的穩健性。政府堅定致力於維護聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金會（IMF）在其2023年《對外部門報告》中再次重申，聯匯制度的可信度得益於一套透明的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管與審慎的經濟結構和穩健的財政框架。\n\n健全的銀行體系對於聯動早期警示系統的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續運作暢順，流動性狀況及資本充足率均遠高於國際標準。為確保銀行體系的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試的結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管力度。\n\n為提高貨幣單位制度帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的交換基金資產撥配用於支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）由2022年底的110.12%上升至2023年5月4日的112.71%的高位，超過了112.5%的超逾觸發水平（圖表4）。這主要是由於年初時觸發弱方兌換機制，導致總結餘收縮所致<sup>2<\/sup>。根據交換基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，以及由於債務憑證的贖回，資產已從支持投資組合轉移至投資組合，以將支持比率降低至5月8日左右的109.97%。此後，支持比率穩步上升，並於12月31日收報110.73%。在聯動匯率制度下，雖然已指定特定的交換基金資產用於支持投資組合，但所有交換基金資產均可動用以支持港元匯率。交換基金充裕的財政資源，加上穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖表四：2023年背書比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣局小組委員會\n\n貨幣事務委員會轄下之聯繫匯率制度諮詢委員會（CBC）監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2023年，委員會審議了包括2022年5月穩定幣市場崩潰、聯儲局向銀行提供美元流動性支持措施傳導至香港的影響，以及近期香港元利率的變動等問題。委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予委員會的聯繫匯率制度運作報告，均已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n以下表格總結了截至2023年底流通紙幣和硬幣的價值：\n\n圖表 5 各發行銀行於2023年底流通紙幣金額\n\n圖表六：2023年底流通紙幣分佈情況\n\n圖表 7 截至2023年底流通紙幣數量\n\n圖表 8 2023年底政府發行貨幣紙鈔及硬幣流通量\n\n圖九：二零二三年末政府發行貨幣紙幣及硬幣流通情況分項統計\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n年內，香港金融管理局繼續為銀行櫃員、零售商戶收銀員及學生舉辦關於香港紙幣設計及防偽特徵的研討會，以提升他們識別真偽鈔的知識和技能。二零二三年共安排了15場研討會，約有3,000人參加。\n\n# 錢幣收藏計劃\n\n「紀念幣收藏計劃」繼續受到公眾熱烈歡迎。有關計劃的更多資訊，請參閱《可持續發展報告2023》中「香港金融管理局可持續發展」章節。\n\n# 匯豐票據及儲蓄紙幣\n\n聯匯基金計劃運作暢順。截至二零二三年底，未償在即期結算交易所基金票據的總面值約為港幣一萬二千五百五十四億元（表二）。\n\n表 2 待解決的 EFBN 問題\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融學術研究院（香港金研院）3，作為香港金融學院的研究部門，發表了20篇工作論文，並舉辦了17個研討會／網絡研討會，主題圍繞對香港及區域具有策略重要性的貨幣及金融研究課題。香港金研院亦在社會科學研究網絡（SSRN）上發表了六期電子期刊，以向SSRN的全球研究社群傳播研究成果。此外，為向公眾提供近期已發表工作論文的高層次、非技術性摘要，香港金研院發行了兩期《貨幣研究洞見》。\n\n除了其研究活動外，香港金融管理局（香港金管局）還組織了四項國際活動、一次圓桌會議以及四場研討會／網絡研討會，與學術界、全球中央銀行和國際金融機構進行對話和交流，以促進對經濟和金融議題的討論：\n\n# 3月9日\n\n國際貨幣基金會（IMF）駐華高級代表巴奈特·史蒂文·艾倫博士，以及IMF駐香港特別行政區代表杰薩庫爾·帕卡瓦博士，共同舉辦了一場題為「中國經濟反彈：近期發展與展望」的研討會。巴奈特博士分享了他對中國經濟最新發展的看法，以及短期和中期需要解決的問題。共有超過一百名與會者參加了此次研討會。\n\n# 四月十七日\n\n於日前舉行了一場關於「在充滿挑戰的世界中前行」的研討會。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）四位專家分享了他們對IMF最新一期《世界經濟展望》和《全球金融穩定報告》分析章節的看法。共有超過五十位人士參與了此次研討會。\n\n# 四月二十五日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）舉辦了一場研討會，由貨幣及資本市場部助理主任吳嘉遜博士與高級金融部門專家湯馬斯·波因特克先生共同介紹IMF 2023年4月《全球金融穩定報告》，主題為「在高通膨及利率環境下維護全球金融穩定」。研討會吸引了超過八十位與會者。\n\n# 五月二日\n\n國際貨幣基金組織亞太事務部主任克里希納·斯里尼瓦桑先生與香港金融管理局行政總裁余偉文先生進行了一場關於在充滿挑戰的世界中展望亞洲的爐邊談話。斯里尼瓦桑先生闡述了國際貨幣基金組織最近的亞洲區域經濟展望報告的主要信息，並分享了他對全球和區域經濟的主要驅動因素和風險的看法。此外，對話涵蓋了許多關於區域經濟和國際貨幣體系演變的重要議題。約有120名人士參加了此次活動。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained strong and resilient in 2023 despite multiple headwinds, including the March banking turmoil in the US and Europe, a high interest rate environment and geopolitical tensions. The HKMA responded swiftly to the March banking turmoil — from managing the ripple effects to completing an internal review (covering such areas as the supervisory processes and resolution framework) drawing lessons for the local banking sector, while maintaining its focus on the credit, liquidity and market risk management of authorized institutions. In light of escalating cyber threats and the increasing use of technology services provided by third parties, the HKMA also worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational and cyber resilience.\n\nThe HKMA enhanced consumer protection in respect of payment cards, and through further revision of the Code of Banking Practice as well as the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter. The HKMA worked with fellow regulators on a balanced regulatory regime for virtual asset-related activities, streamlined the selling process for sophisticated professional investors, introduced enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and commenced supervision of trust business. A pilot programme was launched to prepare for provision of consumer credit reference services under “Credit Data Smart”.\n\nThe HKMA’s efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) reflect a commitment to targeting the highest threats under a risk-based approach. To address increasing digital fraud, the HKMA has strengthened ecosystem collaboration through the launch of real-time fraud monitoring and expanding the scope of public-private information-sharing partnerships, including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce. The launch of a ground-breaking platform to facilitate bank-to-bank information sharing will help address the risk of mule account networks, while the HKMA also worked closely with the industry to take concerted action to handle increasing fraud-related banking complaints and raise public awareness about different scams, including a pre-transaction alert mechanism when using the Faster Payment System. In parallel, supervisory technology capabilities were also advanced through the Macro Analytics pilot scheme.\n\nGood progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure. Notable efforts were also made in enhancing capacity building in the banking sector, attracting and nurturing future talents and upskilling existing practitioners. In addition, the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board completed a public consultation on proposed enhancements to the Deposit Protection Scheme.\n\nThe HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime. A new resolution standard related to accessing critical financial market infrastructures was developed and a review on experiences of implementing loss-absorbing capacity policy standards was completed. Significant progress was made in resolution planning with banks to address early termination risk and operational continuity in resolution. The HKMA also continued to be active in international policy initiatives and regional co-operation on resolution.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nThe Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework is not designed to ensure a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions. To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency. Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.\n\n# Review of 2023\n\n# Licensing\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted one banking licence and one restricted bank licence to two banks incorporated outside Hong Kong. The HKMA also granted money broker approval to four foreign trading platform operators and revoked another approval granted to one money broker. The HKMA revoked authorizations of five licensed banks during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 313 to 316 and 322 to 325 respectively.\n\n# Review of three-tier banking system\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted a comprehensive review on the three-tier banking system in order to simplify the structure of Hong Kong’s banking system. The review found that the three-tier system has become more complex than necessary to achieve the original aim to strike a balance between flexibility of entry into the banking system and protection of small depositors. Subsequently, the HKMA commenced a three-month consultation in June on a proposal to simplify the three-tier banking system into two tiers by merging deposit-taking companies into the restricted licence bank sector, thereby forming a new second tier of Hong Kong’s banking system. Respondents were generally supportive of the proposal.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA conducted 177 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance and risk management. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 38 meetings were held with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations on a wide range of AIs’ activities. Credit risk management was a key focus given the challenging credit risk landscape amid a high interest rate environment and debt defaults by some Mainland property developers. The management of operational risk and technology risk was another major focus as the adoption of technology by AIs gathered further momentum. The HKMA also stepped up its supervisory work on climate risk management and rolled out a new round of thematic examinations focused on climaterelated risk governance, and a series of consultative sessions to provide supervisory guidance to AIs.\n\nThe banking turmoil in the US and Europe that started in March 2023 was the most significant system-wide banking stress since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in terms of scale and scope. The HKMA stayed on high alert as the turmoil unfolded and took a number of precautionary actions to ensure that any potential fallout would not undermine confidence in the local banking and financial system. After the episode, the HKMA conducted an internal review exercise having regard to the observations and experience gained from the turmoil. Based on this exercise, the HKMA developed a detailed action plan to incorporate lessons learnt with a view to strengthening its supervisory effectiveness and augmenting its ability to handle a banking crisis if one did occur. See Liquidity and market risks on page 95 for more details on the HKMA’s work in this respect.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA carried out on-site examinations in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses as well as consumer protection matters, supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk or new initiatives.\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2023.\n\nTable 1 Summary of supervisory activities\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans decreased by 3.6% in 2023, compared with a decline of 3.0% in 2022. Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances. Mainland-related lending decreased by 6.6% to HK$4,226 billion in 2023 (Table 3).\n\nTable 2 Growth in loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Growth in Mainland-related lending\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA intensified supervisory efforts in monitoring AIs’ asset quality and assessing their credit risk management practices given the high interest rate environment and continued weakness in the Mainland property market. The asset quality of the banking sector deteriorated during the year but remained manageable. The classified loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.56% at the end of 2023, up from 1.40% at the end of 2022. The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending increased to 2.58% from 2.26% at the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted targeted and thematic examinations to evaluate AIs’ credit risk management focusing on exposures to vulnerable sectors, premium financing, oversight of credit risks at operations outside Hong Kong and exposures to non-bank financial institutions.\n\n# Alleviating cash flow pressure faced by bank customers\n\nThe HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced in July the commencement of an orderly exit from the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme. The Scheme was introduced in May 2020 to tide eligible corporates over the pandemic. Taking into account the views of the commercial sectors, the partial principal repayment options were enhanced to assist corporates’ gradual return to normal repayment. Where sectors or individual borrowers were still facing challenges despite the end of the pandemic, banks continued to offer principal moratorium or other suitable credit relief measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe HKMA also encouraged banks to be sympathetic in handling the funding needs of corporates which had not participated in the Scheme but were facing cash flow pressures due to individual circumstances. The HKMA reminded banks to follow the “Hong Kong Approach to Corporate Difficulties” guidelines in dealing with corporates encountering repayment problems, so that individual banks would act collaboratively in the common interest of the lenders involved.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management of their property mortgage lending business and the banking sector’s capacity to cope with challenges arising from a sharp correction in property prices. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans approved in 2023 stood at 57%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced (Chart 1). The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages stayed low at 40% in 2023, compared with 41% in August 2010 when a cap on DSR was first applied.\n\nOn 7 July, the HKMA adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures after taking into account factors such as property prices, transaction volumes and the local and external economic environment. This was the first time the countercyclical macroprudential measures for residential properties were relaxed since their introduction in 2009. The adjustments included increasing the maximum LTV ratios for residential properties and commercial properties, as well as for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of mortgage applicants. In addition, the requirements to lower the applicable maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit by ten percentage points for mortgage applicants with incomes derived mainly from places outside of Hong Kong were lifted. The HKMA also removed the requirement to apply a five-percentage-point reduction on applicable DSR limits when mortgage applicants’ total mortgage finance exceeded the HKMA’s normal permissible LTV ceilings by 20 percentage points.\n\nChart 1 Average LTV ratio and DSR of new residential mortgage loans approved\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2023年即使面對多重逆風，包括三月份美國及歐洲的銀行動盪、高利率環境以及地緣政治緊張局勢，仍然保持強勁和具韌性。金管局對三月份的銀行動盪迅速作出反應——從管理漣漪效應到完成內部審查（涵蓋監管流程和決議框架等範疇），並為本地銀行業吸取經驗教訓，同時繼續關注認可機構的信貸、流動性及市場風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益嚴重，以及第三方提供的科技服務使用量不斷增加，金管局亦與認可機構緊密合作，提升其營運及網絡安全韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局加強了對支付卡的消費者保護，並透過進一步修訂銀行行為準則以及推出「防騙消費者保護綱領」來實現。金管局與其他監管機構合作，制定虛擬資產相關活動的平衡監管制度，簡化複雜專業投資者的銷售流程，優化「跨境財富管理互聯互通試點計劃」，並開始監管信託業務。此外，金管局亦啟動了一項先導計劃，為在「智信數據」下提供消費者信用資料服務作準備。\n\n香港金融管理局在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/打恐）方面所做的努力，體現了以風險為本的策略，致力於針對最高的威脅。為應對日益增加的數碼詐欺，香港金融管理局已加強生態系統合作，通過推出實時詐欺監控，並擴大公私營資訊共享合作夥伴關係的範圍，當中包括打擊詐欺及洗錢情報專案組。一項開創性的銀行間資訊共享平台已正式啟動，有助於解決冒用帳戶網絡的風險，同時香港金融管理局亦與業界緊密合作，共同採取行動處理不斷增加的與詐欺相關的銀行投訴，並提高公眾對不同詐騙手法的警惕性，包括在使用快速支付系統時的交易前警示機制。與此同時，透過巨觀分析試點計劃，也提升了監管科技能力。\n\n在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了顯著進展，當中包括資本充足率和資訊披露等。在銀行業的能力建設方面也付出了顯著努力，包括吸引和培養未來人才，以及提升現有從業員的技能。此外，香港存款保障委員會已完成對存款保障計劃建議優化的公眾諮詢。\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推進其工作，以確保具信譽的決議機制。制定了一項新的決議標準，與存取關鍵金融市場基礎設施相關；並完成了一項關於實施損失吸收能力政策標準經驗的檢討。在與銀行進行決議規劃方面取得了顯著進展，以應對早期終止風險和決議過程中的營運持續性。香港金融管理局亦繼續積極參與國際政策倡議和區域決議合作。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。實現此目標取決於一個具高度復原力的金融體系，能夠為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式，甚至在極端情況下通過混亂倒閉，可能影響體系穩定。作為監管機構，貨幣當局在維護金融穩定方面扮演著關鍵角色，透過確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止破產。貨幣當局負責對銀行進行審慎監理，並負責授權香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。\n\n香港的審慎監管框架並非旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，作為決策機關，金管局致力於確保，倘若認可金融機構（AI）出現非可行情況，其破產可得到有序處理。為此，香港已建立金融機構決策機制，其中金管局是認可金融機構等不同類型機構的決策機關。為了有效實施香港的決策機制，制定決策規則和政策標準、進行決策規劃以消除認可金融機構可決策性的障礙，以及發展金管局處理陷入困境認可金融機構的運營能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採取與國際接軌且協調一致的方法。\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施（金融市場基礎設施）。在監管金融市場基礎設施方面，金管局旨在提升它們的整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。提升金融市場基礎設施應對金融危機的能力，可保障香港的貨幣及金融系統免受金融市場基礎設施中斷可能造成的破壞性影響。\n\n# 二零二三年回顧\n\n# 授權許可\n\n年內，金管局向兩間在香港以外註冊成立的銀行，批發了一張銀行牌照及一張受限制銀行牌照。金管局亦批准四間外地交易平台營辦商從事貨幣經紀業務，並撤銷了先前授予其中一間貨幣經紀商的批准。年內，金管局撤銷了五間持牌銀行的授權。\n\n更多關於人工智能及在香港的代表辦事處的資訊，請參閱第313至316頁的附件和表格D至F，以及第322至325頁的表格。\n\n# 三層銀行體系回顧\n\n二零二三年，香港金融管理局對三層制的銀行體系進行了全面檢討，旨在簡化香港銀行體系的架構。檢討發現，為達致原先在銀行體系進入的靈活性與保障小額存款人權益之間取得平衡的目的，三層制已變得比必要的複雜。隨後，金管局於六月展開為期三個月的諮詢，就將存款公司合併到受限制銀行牌照範疇，從而將三層制銀行體系簡化為兩層制的建議徵求意見，藉此形成香港銀行體系的新第二層。與會者普遍對此建議表示支持。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n於二零二三年，金管局進行了177項非實地覆核，覆蓋範圍廣泛，包括CAMEL評級評估¹、企業管治及風險管理。作為金管局持續努力加強風險管治的一部分，共與金融機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事級委員會舉行了38次會議。此外，金管局、金融機構及其外部審計師之間召開了38次三方會議。\n\n除了場外活動外，香港金融管理局還定期對認可金融機構（AIs）的各項活動進行現場檢查。鑑於高利率環境及部分內地房地產開發商出現債務違約，信貸風險管理是重點關注領域。隨著認可金融機構採用科技的勢頭日益強勁，營運風險和科技風險的管理亦成為另一個主要關注點。香港金融管理局亦加強了對氣候風險管理的監管工作，並推出新一輪主題檢查，重點關注與氣候相關的風險治理，以及一系列諮詢會議，為認可金融機構提供監管指導。\n\n自2023年3月開始，美國及歐洲的銀行動盪是自2008年全球金融危機以來，規模和影響範圍最為重大的系統性銀行壓力。香港金融管理局（金管局）密切關注事態發展，並採取了一系列預防性措施，以確保任何潛在影響不會損害本地銀行和金融系統的信心。事件過後，金管局參考從這次動盪中汲取的觀察和經驗，進行了內部檢討。基於這次檢討，金管局制定了一項詳細的行動計劃，以吸取經驗教訓，從而加強其監管效能，並提升應對銀行危機的能力（若發生）。有關金管局在這方面的具體工作，請參閱第95頁的「流動性及市場風險」部分。\n\n在行為監理方面，香港金融管理局對證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務，以及消費者保護事宜進行了實地檢查，並針對被評估為風險較高或新舉措的範疇，輔以主題式審查。\n\n表 1 載列香港金融管理局 2023 年的監管活動摘要。\n\n表 1 監督活動摘要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款於二零二三年減少了3.6%，較二零二二年減少3.0%的情況有所擴大。表2顯示貸款及墊款增長情況的細分。與中國內地相關的貸款於二零二三年減少6.6%至4,226億港元（表3）。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款增長情況\n\n表 3 與大陸相關貸款增長\n\n於二零二三年，香港金融管理局加強監管力度，密切監察金融機構的資產質素，並評估其信貸風險管理措施，以應對高利率環境及中國內地房地產市場持續疲弱的狀況。銀行業的資產質素在年內有所下降，但仍可控制。銀行業不良貸款比率於二零二三年底為1.56%，較二零二二年底的1.40%上升。與中國內地相關的貸款不良貸款比率亦由二零二二年底的2.26%上升至2.58%。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局進行了有針對性和主題性的檢查，以評估銀行在信貸風險管理方面的表現，重點關注對脆弱行業的風險敞口、高端融資、對香港以外機構的信貸風險監控，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險敞口。\n\n# 舒緩銀行客戶的現金流壓力\n\n香港金融管理局與銀行界中小企業信貸協調機制於七月宣布，將有序退出「預先批准本金還款假期計劃」。該計劃於二零二零年五月推出，旨在協助合資格企業渡過疫情難關。經考慮業界意見後，部分本金還款選項已獲優化，以協助企業逐步恢復正常還款。對於即使疫情結束後仍面臨挑戰的行業或個別借款人，銀行將繼續按個案提供本金寬限期或其他合適的信貸舒緩措施。\n\n香港金融管理局亦鼓勵銀行在處理未參與計劃但因個別情況面臨現金流壓力的企業的融資需求時，多加體諒。金管局提醒銀行在處理出現還款困難的企業時，應遵循《香港企業困難處理原則》，以便各銀行在涉及的貸款人共同利益下，通力合作。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局陸續推出的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已加強銀行對房地產按揭貸款業務的風險管理，以及銀行業應對房價大幅下跌所帶來的挑戰的能力。2023年批准的新住宅按揭貸款平均貸款價值比率為57%，較首次推出逆周期措施前的2009年9月的64%為低。2023年新按揭貸款的平均債務收入比率維持在40%的低水平，較首次實施債務收入比率上限的2010年8月的41%為低。\n\n7月7日，香港金融管理局經考慮物業價格、交易量以及本地和外部經濟環境等因素後，調整了逆周期宏觀審慎措施。 這是自2009年推出住宅物業逆周期宏觀審慎措施以來，首次放寬相關措施。調整內容包括提高住宅物業和商業物業的最高貸款價值比率，以及按貸款申請人的資產淨值評估的按揭貸款的最高貸款價值比率。此外，取消了對主要從香港以外地區獲取收入的按揭貸款申請人，適用最高貸款價值比率和債務收入比率上限需降低十個百分點的要求。香港金融管理局亦取消了當按揭貸款申請人的總按揭融資超出香港金融管理局正常許可的最高貸款價值比率上限20個百分點時，適用債務收入比率上限需減減五個百分點的要求。\n\n圖表 1 新批准住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率及負債收入比率\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nIn 2023, the HKMA utilised a multi-pronged approach to achieve notable progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre.\n\nThe success of two major events, namely the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit and the HKMA-BIS High-Level Conference, had reinforced Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and created positive ripple effects.\n\nThe HKMA, together with its Mainland and Hong Kong counterparts, made concerted efforts to deepen and widen the mutual access between the financial markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. This included enhancements to the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the designation of additional market makers for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, the successful launch of Northbound Trading of Swap Connect, and the roll-out of the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme. These initiatives were effective in strengthening Hong Kong’s gateway position and reinforcing the city’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them well informed about the opportunities in Hong Kong’s financial market and its resilience.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on all fronts of the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy, including in areas such as promoting fintech adoption, Central Bank Digital Currency, data infrastructure, talent development, and policies and funding support.\n\nThe Faster Payment System (FPS) marked its fifth anniversary in September. The number of registrations has grown steadily, and had reached 13.6 million at the end of 2023. The average daily turnover for the year rose to 1.25 million real-time transactions. FPS x PromptPay link for cross-border QR payment between Hong Kong and Thailand was jointly launched with the Bank of Thailand in December, providing a fast, secure and easily accessible cross-border retail payment service for people travelling between the two places.\n\nAs an active member of many international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, the HKMA continued to contribute to global efforts to maintain financial stability and promote financial market developments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued making proactive efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. In November, it organised the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit for the second year. This three-day event brought together prominent financial leaders from around the world to share their unique perspectives under the theme of “Living with Complexity”. With over 350 participants from 160 international financial institutions attending, the summit clearly showed the global financial sector’s commitment to and confidence in Hong Kong. In the same month, the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted the HKMA-BIS High Level Conference, which attracted more than 300 participants, including over 20 current and former central bank governors. The conference highlighted the HKMA’s close collaboration with the BIS as well as with the international central banking community.\n\nThe expansion of and enhancements made to the MainlandHong Kong Connect schemes have reinforced Hong Kong’s role as the bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. A series of enhancements to the Crossboundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) scheme were introduced to facilitate cross-boundary retail investment in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Riding on the smooth operations of Southbound Bond Connect, the HKMA designated nine additional market makers to improve secondary liquidity and meet investor demand. Northbound Trading of Swap Connect was successfully launched in the year, enabling global investors to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their Mainland fixed income portfolio via Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s offshore renminbi businesses saw robust growth during the year. The HKMA collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch the HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model and the Dual Counter Market Making Programme in June. This helped develop a more diverse range of renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong by facilitating the issuance and trading of renminbidenominated stocks in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA continued to work on strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. In particular, to enhance Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund management centre, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitative tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress was also made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong’s bond market, and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up its market outreach activities to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nBoth the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO) and the banking departments of the HKMA continued to implement the “Fintech 2025” strategy1 to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives implemented during the year included:\n- promoting further adoption in the tech focus areas of Wealthtech, Insurtech, Greentech, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology (DLT);\n- advancing the work on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to improve cross-border payments;\n- progressing further in the study on the prospect of introducing a retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. an e-HKD;\n- stepping up efforts to develop Commercial Data Interchange (CDI);\n- enhancing talent development;\n- nurturing the fintech ecosystem through funding and policies;\n- strengthening cross-border collaboration in fintech; and\n- expanding the adoption of the FPS.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is vital for maintaining the city’s position as a leading international financial centre. In 2023, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100%2 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%. The debt securities settlement service, including the Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect linkage service, continued to operate smoothly.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to increase in 2023, marking the significant milestone of the FPS reaching its fifth anniversary. The number of registrations for the FPS and the FPS turnover have grown steadily over the past five years, with the number of registrations growing to 13.6 million at the end of 2023 and the average daily turnover for the year rising by 33% from 2022. The increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments, and topping up Stored Value Facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts, were key drivers for the continued rise in the transaction volume, on top of steady growth in person-toperson and business payments.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 17 licensed SVFs (four of which are SVFs issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). During the year, the HKMA also continued to facilitate the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme, helping to co-ordinate the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme, and facilitate dialogue and co-operation between them.\n\nOn 27 December, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the HKMA jointly issued a public consultation paper on regulation for stablecoin issuers. The HKMA subsequently introduced a sandbox arrangement on 12 March 2024 for institutions planning to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKMA has been actively participating in the work of international bodies in relation to crypto-asset activities, and monitoring the development of the market closely.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA has remained an active member of the central banking community and continued to play a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. Currently, the HKMA co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), as well as the Regional Consultative Group for Asia, the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (until June) and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The HKMA also chairs the BIS’ Meeting of Governors from Major Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Between 2018 and 2023, the HKMA served consecutive terms as the chair of the Working Group on Financial Markets established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)3.\n\nThe HKMA also held bilateral meetings with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Saudi Central Bank in May and July respectively to promote investment and financial market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging. Although some banks in the US and Europe experienced liquidity issues at the beginning of the year, the associated risks did not spread across the financial markets. While levels of inflation in major developed economies have declined from their peak in 2023, they have remained above the targets set by major central banks. Following an aggressive rate hike cycle, the US Federal Reserve has paused hiking rate since the third quarter, and indicated that the policy rate was likely at or near its peak. This, coupled with a resilient US economy, has made investor sentiment more optimistic. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East during the year, added turbulence and uncertainties to the investment market. In this complicated and dynamic investment environment, the investment performance of the Exchange Fund experienced some ups and downs. Despite this, the Exchange Fund managed to achieve a decent investment return. In 2023, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion, representing an investment return of 5.5%.\n\n# The Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems in order to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) To preserve capital;\n(ii) To ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) To ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) Subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base, as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with a view to preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. These include emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The target asset allocation of the LTGP is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles and portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to its unique nature, the Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by the Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1. A major exception is the Future Fund2, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix. The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 35:65 in 2023.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation based on the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error3 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses the Exchange Fund’s investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. The part of the IP managed internally includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, while also drawing on diverse and complementary investment styles and taking advantage of external market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nAs the investment environment becomes more complex, good risk management is increasingly important. The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both its internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures that a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities. Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored. The risk management process provides a robust framework that supports the HKMA’s strategic planning and investment diversification efforts.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance can help better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund, as well as reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters of its underlying investments. To embrace responsible investment practices, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into the investment processes of the Exchange Fund, with the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if their long-term risk-adjusted returns are comparable with other investments. For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment work, see the Responsible Investment chapter of the Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n# The financial markets in 2023\n\nThe investment environment in 2023 was volatile and challenging.\n\nGlobal equities were generally on an upward trend in 2023. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 24% during the year, especially in the fourth quarter as markets began to anticipate sooner-than-expected rate cuts.\n\nIn the bond markets, yields remained high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging above 5% at one point to reach its highest level since 2007. However, as market expectations of central banks’ monetary policies shifted, bond yields retreated towards the end of the year alongside a gradual increase in bond prices.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar recorded a mixed performance against major currencies. Among these, the pound sterling and the euro appreciated against the US dollar, while the yen and the renminbi depreciated.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2023 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2023 market returns\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$226.0 billion in 2023. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$144.7 billion, gains on equities of HK$58.1 billion (with gains of HK$73.6 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$15.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a negative currency translation effect of HK$0.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$23.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$4.8 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,016.5 billion at the end of the year. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$517.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$411.9 billion and real estate HK$105.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$291.1 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2023, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 5.5%. The returns of the IP and the BP were 6.4% and 5.0% respectively. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.8% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2023 are set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2023 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 1.6% during 2021–2023, 3.3% during 2019–2023, 2.7% during 2014–2023 and 4.5% since 1994.

In light of the rise in phishing scams and credit card fraud, the HKMA continued its efforts across different media to remind the public to stay vigilant. A brand new awareness campaign was rolled out following the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter, emphasising that banks and major merchants have committed not to send hyperlinks via instant electronic messages soliciting personal and credit card information. The HKMA also passed on smart tips on credit cards, personal loans, online shopping, banking services and different payment options (including “Buy Now, Pay Later” products) via radio and social media channels.\n\nA new video and animations with cannibal plant and animal trap are produced with the theme “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\nCross-media publicity is produced reminding members of the public not to click on suspicious links\n\nAnimated video to promote e-laisees\n\nIn support of the environment, and drawing on technological advances in financial services, the HKMA encouraged members of the public to give out electronic lai sees (e-laisees) and to consider using good-as-new banknotes for physical lai sees over the Chinese New Year through social media and radio promotions.\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance public understanding of the financial industry and raise young people’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry, thus enlarging Hong Kong’s talent pool for the financial industry. Following positive feedback for its earlier video series “Four Faces of Talents in Central”, the HKMA launched a new video series titled “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” that featured four growth areas in the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management. The video series utilised computer graphics and animation to show seasoned market practitioners supervising young talents as they managed daily work challenges, providing a light-touch introduction to career opportunities and prospects within the industry.\n\nA video series “Financial Special Forces: Unleashing New Horizons” is produced to keep the younger generation abreast of career opportunities in finance\n\nMentors from different areas sharing their expertise and experience with students\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA worked with other stakeholders to co-organise the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” for the ninth consecutive year. Under the theme of digital and sustainable economy, the event helped students learn more about money management, green and sustainability, the current state of the financial market and career opportunities. It also included an online quiz that received around 20,000 submissions, mentoring by experienced practitioners from diverse areas, and design thinking challenge.\n\n# $mart Money Management 321\n\nThe HKMA launched its first financial education board game called “$mart Money Management 321”, which is jointly designed and developed with a social enterprise specialising in board game production. The board game was designed to help primary school students learn about different payment methods, money management concepts, fintech and cybersecurity in a simulated setting.\n\nThe HKMA took a booth at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2023 to promote the board game, which was one of the best-selling items at the Fair. In addition, the HKMA organised a series of free promotional activities, which included workshops in community centres, trials for students in primary schools, and train-the-trainer workshops for primary school teachers and social workers at non-governmental organisations, as well as running a “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” at PMQ during the festive season.\n\nThe HKMA’s first financial education board game, “$mart Money Management 321”, and the “$mart Money Management Experiential Centre” receive several international design awards\n\nFollowing its launch at the Hong Kong Book Fair, the board game is promoted through train-the-trainer workshops, student trial sessions and an experiential centre at PMQ\n\nThe HKMA also collaborated with different stakeholders in a number of community engagement programmes. One of these was the second phase of a cross-generation outreach educational programme, organised jointly with an educational institution. It included a bank simulation game along with talks targeting kindergarten students, their parents and teachers, and young adults.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the work of the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and financial capacity in Hong Kong. It will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of its community engagement work.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as they are applicable to central banking operations. These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, such as the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and controls\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 211 to 311, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2023 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nProf. LAM Chi Yuen Nelson\nDirector of Audit\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66). The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio. The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual HKFRSs, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. Material accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new or revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except for the following assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\n- derivative financial instruments (note 2.6);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through income and expenditure account (note 2.6);\n- financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (note 2.6);\n- gold (note 2.10); and\n- investment properties (note 2.11).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgements made by management in the application of HKFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.18.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation of the Group financial statements.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 匯豐儲備基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財務司\n\n# 觀點\n\n我謹此證明，我已審核了第211至311頁所載的交換基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）財務報表，包括截至2023年12月31日止的交換基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及其收入及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要的會計政策資訊。\n\n本人認為，截至二零二三年十二月三十一日，該基金及本集團的財務報表真實及公允地反映了該基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港財務報告準則」）編製，且已遵照根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官指示妥善編製。\n\n# 觀點依據\n\n我依照《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官指示及審計署審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則的職責，於我的報告內「審計師就財務報表審計的責任」一段中進一步闡述。我符合該等準則的要求，與本集團保持獨立，並已履行其他專業道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據充分及適當，為我提供發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我對截至二零二三年十二月三十一日止年度財務報表的審計過程中，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。 這些事項是在我對財務報表整體審計的背景下加以處理，並在形成我的審計意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資料。 這些資料包括香港金融管理局2023年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計報告。\n\n我的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此等資訊表示任何形式的保証結論。\n\n與我審核財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或我在審核過程中所得知的資訊存在重大不符，或在其他方面存在重大錯誤陳述。如果根據我所進行的工作，我認為此等其他資料存在重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。就此，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 香港金融管理局及匯風諮詢委員會審核委員會於財務報表中的職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示編製真實公允的財務報表，並為此建立內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n於編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及採用持續經營為基礎會計處理。\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會審核小組負責監察本集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確定財務報表整體而言是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論該錯誤陳述是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並發出包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並不能保證依照審計署審計準則進行的審計，總能發現當重大錯誤陳述存在時將其偵出。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，如果這些錯誤陳述單獨或彙總起來，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則認為其屬重大。\n\n作為根據審計署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我貫徹專業判斷，並於整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，不論是由於欺詐或錯誤所致，設計及執行對應於這些風險的審計程序，並獲取充足及適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。因欺詐而導致的重大錯誤陳述未被發現的風險，較因錯誤而導致的風險為高，因為欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n了解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計適宜於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n評估貨幣管理局所使用會計政策的適當性，以及會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n對貨幣管理局採用持續經營假設的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大不確定性的事件或情況。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我需要於審計報告中引起注意財務報表中的相關披露，或者，如果該等披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計報告日所獲取的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致本集團停止持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體列報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允列報的方式反映其背後的交易和事件；以及\n獲取關於本集團內各實體或業務活動的財務信息的充足適當審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的方向、監督和執行。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我會與證券基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重要的審計發現（包括我在審計過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷）等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向彼等通報所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及如適用，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事宜，我確定本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，並將其定為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為在報告中溝通該事項會導致負面後果合理預期超過此類溝通的公共利益，否則我會在我的審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n林志遠 教授\n審計署署長\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長以匯風儲備基金（基金）監管人的身份所授予權力，按照《匯風儲備基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是保障港幣的匯價穩定，以及維持香港的貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全。\n\n本基金的資產以四個投資組合管理：即後盾投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及策略投資組合。後盾投資組合的資產完全與香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎相符。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織（OECD）成員國的債券和股權市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港特別行政區政府代表本基金，為策略目的而收購的香港交易所及結算所有限公司的股份。經營分部信息載於附註31。\n\n# 二、存貨會計政策\n\n## 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表乃根據香港財務報告準則（香港財務報告準則為涵蓋香港會計師公會（香港會計師公會）頒佈的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及解釋，以及香港普遍接受的會計原則的統稱）編製。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）所採納的主要會計政策載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的或經修訂的香港財務報告準則，於本會計期間首次生效或可供提早採用。附註三提供有關因首次應用這些發展而導致會計政策的變動資訊（如有），而這些變動與本集團目前及過往會計期間內反映於這些財務報表中的情況相關。\n\n## 2.2 財務報表編制基礎\n\n本集團財務報表包括本集團之財務報表以及本集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註十六及十七。\n\n財務報表之編製基礎採用歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按公允價值衡量：\n- 金融衍生工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公允價值計入損益之金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公允價值計入其他綜合收益之金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及\n- 投資性不動產（附註2.11）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需要作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。這些估計和相關假設乃基於過往經驗及其他於當時情況下被認為屬合理的因素，其結果構成判斷資產和負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非容易從其他來源得知。實際結果可能與這些估計存在差異。\n\n估計和相關假設會持續進行檢討。會計估計的修訂，若僅影響該修訂期間，則於該期間認列；若影響當期及未來期間，則於修訂期間及未來期間認列。\n\n管理層於應用香港財務報告準則時所作出的對財務報表有重大影響的判斷，以及主要的估計不確定性來源，於附註2.18中披露。\n\n某些比較數字已重述，以符合本集團財務報表本年度的列報方式。\n\n## 2.3 附屬公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由本集團控制的實體。本集團於其與該實體的參與中，承受或擁有來自該實體的變動回報，並有能力透過對該實體的權力影響該等回報時，即控制該實體。評估本集團是否擁有權力時，僅考慮實質權利（由本集團及其他各方持有）。\n"}
