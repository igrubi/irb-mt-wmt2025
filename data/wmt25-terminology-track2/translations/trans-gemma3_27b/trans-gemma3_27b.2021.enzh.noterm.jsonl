{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n","zh":"# 行政總裁致詞\n\n二零二一年是既鞏固亦發展的一年。\n\n二零二一年，疫情持續延燒至第二年，全球供應鏈受到擾亂，通膨壓力升高，全球金融狀況過早緊縮的風險也隨之增加。 此外，新冠病毒變異株的出現以及地緣政治緊張局勢的加劇，更增添了不確定性。 儘管面臨充滿不確定性的宏觀環境，我們仍致力於維護貨幣及金融穩定，並保持營運韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來復甦的希望，這歸功於新冠疫苗的成功接種，以及多個經濟體採取的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟開始從2020年的嚴重萎縮中復甦。本地方面，香港經濟在2019年和2020年經歷經濟收縮後，在2021年增長了6.3%，這得益於疫苗接種計劃的推行，以及特區政府的疫情援助措施，為我們的經濟復甦提供了關鍵支持。\n\n鑒於金融及貨幣穩定維持，以及宏觀經濟環境趨於穩定，2021年為我們提供了更多發展空間。我們把握機會，積極推進發展舉措，以協助我們的金融業保持高度競爭力。在金融科技、綠色金融以及香港作為橋樑所帶來的內地市場機遇這三大策略重點領域，我們均取得了顯著進展。\n\n踏入二零二二年，全球環境轉趨惡化。但俗語有云：「艱難時刻更能顯英雄本色」。我們將繼續積極進取，致力實現我們的發展目標和優先事項，以更充分的準備迎接下一項挑戰，並鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅定不移地履行承諾，確保香港的貨幣及金融體系穩健可靠，正如過去多次一樣，我們將再次應對各種挑戰。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心之基石\n\n自一九八三年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並協助香港抵禦了多次衝擊和挑戰。儘管新冠肺炎疫情仍然帶來不明朗因素，以及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮，港元匯率及貨幣市場在整個年度均保持有序運作，充分反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n這種對我們制度的信心並非一蹴可幾，而是多年來穩固基礎的成果。國際貨幣基金會在2021年的外部部門報告中再次重申，由於一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、健全的金融監管與監督、具彈性的經濟以及審慎的財政框架，令本地外匯儲備系統的信譽獲得保障。\n\n信心增強亦歸功於我們在公眾及市場參與方面的努力，以及有效的監控。後者方面，我們利用科技和數據分析來強化我們對金融穩定及宏觀審慎監控進行更及時和全面的分析能力。\n\n香港的銀行體系穩健性對金融穩定至關重要。在新冠肺炎疫情爆發兩年後，本港銀行憑藉良好的流動資金狀況及充足的資本，表現出高度韌性，其表現均符合甚至超越國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行資本充足比率為20.2%，遠高於8%的最低要求；而大型銀行在2021年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋率為151.9%，亦遠高於法定的100%最低要求。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，銀行業的資產質素在年內大致保持穩定。業界不良貸款比率於2021年底為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的堅實支柱\n\n與往常一樣，銀行業是支持經濟活動的重要支柱。在新冠疫情爆發導致的經濟影響下，這一點變得更加重要。過去一年，主要挑戰是在管理銀行業信貸風險與維持銀行業對實體經濟支持之間取得平衡。 憑藉多年來的監管工作，銀行繼續有效管理信貸風險。同時，我們與銀行密切合作，透過「預先批准本金還款暫緩計劃」（PPPHS）和其他寬減措施，為企業和個人客戶提供急切需要的援助。PPPHS於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制共同推出，讓符合資格的企業客戶可以預先獲得批准，將貸款本金還款延期六個月。 鑒於部分經濟行業仍受到疫情持續影響，且需要持續的信貸寬減，PPPHS在2021年再次延長兩次，直至2022年4月。 隨後，鑑於本地新冠病毒感染再次出現，PPPHS於2022年2月進一步延長至2022年10月底。令人鼓舞的是，銀行業與金管局攜手合作，幫助緩解企業和個人借款人的現金流壓力，即使銀行業自身也因疫情爆發而面臨艱難的經營環境。\n\n除了嚴峻的信貸環境，疫情也帶來更艱難的營運環境，以及網路威脅日益升高的數位環境。我們已加強努力，提升銀行業的營運及網路安全韌性，並在數位化加速和網路釣魚詐騙激增的情況下，加強消費者及投資者保護。特別是，銀行行為準則已進行修訂，以加強對數碼金融服務中消費者保護。\n\n除了監務工作外，我們致力於推廣銀行業的金融普及及以客戶為中心的文化。提升有需要客戶獲得銀行服務的可及性一直是我們的優先領域，我們亦與業界緊密合作，共同制定行業指引。繼《暢通銀行服務指引》及《為智力障礙人士提供銀行服務指引》後，業界在金管局的支持下，於2021年12月發布了一份指引，旨在闡述銀行業為患有認知障礙症及有需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好常規。\n\n為配合銀行業未來發展，面對新的增長機遇和挑戰，對人才技能提出新的要求，香港金融管理局制定了一項全面的人才發展策略—「連結人才，展望未來」，以更系統和有針對性的方式培養未來人才，並提升現有從業員的技能。 我們的全新策略建立在三個「連結」方向之上：連結學生與銀行業、連結從業員與銀行業的未來，以及連結主要持份者，加強合作以推行策略。 我們已展開一系列外展和宣傳活動，以吸引更多學生加入銀行業。 為讓大學生更好地應對未來挑戰，我們與香港銀行專業發展學會合力推出「未來銀行橋樑計劃」，該計劃包含一系列涵蓋實務銀行知識和銀行業高度需求的軟技能課程。 針對現有的銀行從業員，我們一直與業界緊密合作，提供更多符合市場需求的培訓課程，以提升他們的技能。 於2021年12月，我們推出了銀行業從業員能力提升框架下的全新金融科技模組。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心未來發展至關重要。我們將與各利益相關者攜手合作，以加強人才儲備，進一步發展這個行業。\n\n# 國際金融中心：憑藉無與倫比的機遇，地位穩固。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，建立於其所提供的獨一無二的機遇之上。普遍認為，全球金融科技的應用、內地金融市場的開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的主流化，都為香港金融業的未來發展帶來巨大機遇。香港金融管理局一直致力利用香港獨有的優勢，以把握這些機遇。首先，讓我談談金融科技和內地機遇。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情已清楚地證明了金融科技的強大力量，並永久改變了客戶對金融服務的行為模式。為了確保我們能持續站在全球金融科技的最前沿，並準備好發揮金融科技的全部潛力，我們必須建立一個生態系統，讓各個層面和各個群體都能體驗到金融科技的價值。\n\n這項願景促使我們制定了一項新策略「金融科技2025」，並於2021年6月正式公布。顧名思義，該策略旨在幫助金融業在2025年前全面採用科技。這項策略包含五個重點領域，涵蓋了建立成功生態系統所需的要素，以及促使生態系統持續良性發展的關鍵因素。策略的前兩個部分，即「銀行全面擁抱金融科技」和「為香港應對央行數字貨幣（CBDC）做好準備」，主要旨在創造更多採用金融科技的需求。策略的其他部分則與數據、基礎設施、人才和資金有關，這些對於生態系統的發展至關重要。\n\n在此策略下，推出了一系列新舉措，例如廣東-香港-澳門大灣區金融科技沙盒，讓金融機構和科技公司得以進行先導試驗，並就其跨境金融科技項目從監管機構和使用者處獲得早期回饋；同時，我們也啟動了商業數據交換的試點，藉由利用另類數據來促進中小企業融資。此外，我們已加強研究批發央行數字貨幣（wholesale CBDC）在跨境支付中的應用，並探討電子港幣（e-HKD）的前景，藉此提升香港在採用央行數字貨幣方面的準備，並為未來數十年的金融基礎設施做好保障。\n\n與我們把握科技進步帶來的全新機遇的同時，我們亦會繼續鞏固現有成就，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，於2018年推出的快速支付系統（FPS）近年來發展迅速，截至2021年底，註冊人數已達960萬，較去年增長40%。2020年平均每日交易額亦增加90%，至2021年約67萬筆即時交易。與此同時，鑑於加密資產，尤其是與支付相關的穩定幣快速發展，我們今年初已發布討論文件，邀請市場人士就制定適當的監管框架提供意見。\n\n我們全新的、具有前瞻性的策略將為金融科技生態系統的健康發展奠定基礎。隨著銀行業日益採用金融科技以把握其所帶來的機遇，這最終將惠及金融機構和香港市民，同時強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為通往內地的主要門戶\n\n香港一直扮演著連接內地市場與國際金融市場的重要戰略角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，以進行各類金融、投資和財富管理活動。國家「十四五」規劃進一步鞏固香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。加上全球經濟趨勢，這更堅定了我們香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場獨特價值的信念。\n\n於二零二一年，我們在提升互聯互通方面取得重要里程碑，為「通達」系列計劃增添兩名新成員，分別是粵港澳大灣區「跨境理財通」計劃，以及「債券通」南向交易，基本上完成了股票、債券及理財等多個金融市場的雙向互通。這兩項計劃的推出將為香港帶來各方面的全新機遇。透過滿足內地投資者日益增加的多元化需求，這兩項計劃將擴大我們的債券市場和理財行業的客戶基礎。我很高興看到這兩項計劃運作暢順。金管局將會繼續與內地有關部門合作，隨時間推移進一步優化這些計劃。\n"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n","zh":"# 二零二二年及未來發展重點\n\n全球及本地情況在二零二二年顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級以及市場預期美國聯邦儲備局加息引發了市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟受到新型冠狀病毒疫情新一波的衝擊。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性和多年來累積的緩衝，仍能有效抵禦不利衝擊。展望未來，金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。為此，我們將致力於預先識別新興風險並以靈活的方式應對，力求掌握先機。與此同時，金管局將尋求有助於鞏固香港作為領先國際金融中心的地位的機會。在管理複雜的投資環境下的外匯基金時，金管局將繼續審慎投資，同時保持靈活性，適時採取防禦性措施，並維持高度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系之穩定及誠信\n\n全球經濟前景仍然存在重大不確定性。香港金融管理局將密切關注最新發展，並保持警惕，以防範潛在風險，目標是維護金融體系的韌性和穩定，這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警惕\n\n展望未來，市場或將因各方面增加的不確定性而面臨較大的波動。一方面，如果美國聯邦儲備局持續快速地實施貨幣政策正常化，可能會顯著收緊全球金融狀況，並增加全球債務償還負擔。另一方面，自2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級以來，地緣政治不確定性，包括中美關係緊張，可能持續存在，並再次引發金融市場的波動。最後，隨著疫情的演變，如果大規模重新實施封鎖措施，可能會出現不利情況，導致全球供應瓶頸持續存在，並對全球增長和通脹產生不利影響。儘管如此，香港金融體系在歷年建立的韌性和緩衝能力的支持下，已具備足夠的實力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦具備能力、資源和決心，以維護香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n香港金融管理局將會繼續密切監察內外環境的風險和脆弱性，並隨時準備採取適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣和金融穩定。金融管理局二零二二年研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的議題，並評估其潛在風險。與此同時，金管局持續推行的數碼化計劃將有助提升其監察能力，以支援對金融體系進行更全面的監控和分析。\n\n# 維持銀行體系穩定\n\n隨著成熟市場收緊貨幣政策，以及疫情的影響持續存在，銀行業面臨的信貸環境預計將持續充滿挑戰。與此同時，快速的科技發展和數位化為銀行業帶來了機遇與挑戰。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力於透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行能夠承受衝擊。同時，金管局亦將繼續完善及優化其銀行監管和規管框架及政策，並納入國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n二零二二年，香港金融管理局將加強監察銀行信貸風險敞口，並採取積極措施以確保整體風險水平保持在可控範圍內。\n\n香港金管局亦會繼續監察疫情發展及其對企業經營狀況的影響，並與銀行及商業界別保持緊密溝通，同時檢視各項舒緩措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n鑒於香港金融管理局於二零二二年五月發佈新的《監理政策手冊》中關於「營運韌性」的章節，金管局將會繼續與業界溝通，並了解認可金融機構在制定營運韌性框架方面的進展。與此同時，金管局將會跟進認可金融機構在《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》評估中發現的問題，以及監察認可金融機構實施安全的三級數據備份，藉此提升銀行業的網絡韌性。另一個重要的監理重點是評估和處理認可金融機構對科技服務供應商日益增加的依賴所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉疫情期間提升的數碼能力和累積的大量遠程工作經驗，部分人工智能機構正計劃在恢復常態運作的基礎上轉向混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將密切關注此發展，並評估業界是否充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n香港金融管理局將於2022年專注於監察資產負債管理者的流動性及市場風險管理。具體而言，香港金融管理局將繼續監控資產負債管理者在倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）各設定停止刊發前，轉離剩餘LIBOR設定的進展情況，這些設定將於2023年6月30日停止刊發。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n二零二二年，香港金融管理局在反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（反洗錢\/打恐）方面的工作，將繼續專注於透過合作和資訊共享，加強應對詐欺和金融犯罪。同時，將會與反洗錢\/打恐生態系統內各利益相關者加強合作。其他重點包括，利用增強的數據和監管科技（Suptech）能力，實施更廣泛的風險敏感型監管技術，以及推廣銀行使用金融科技（Regtech），包括交易監控系統。\n\n香港金融管理局亦會繼續與政府、銀行界及儲值設施（SVF）業界緊密合作，發表最新的香港洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險評估，並協助業界對抗新的及新興風險。同時，我們會繼續研究洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險的演變趨勢，修訂反洗錢法及相關指引以符合國際標準，並與其他監管機構及國際標準制定者保持積極互動。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務\n\n二零二二年，香港金融管理局將會對人工智能在財富管理、證券銷售、強積金（MPF）以及其他投資及保險產品方面的行為進行現場檢查和非現場監察，重點關注粵港澳大灣區「跨境財富管理通」計畫（「跨境理財通」）、數碼顧問平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產以及非投資連繫長期保險產品。\n\n與其他監管機構及銀行業界保持緊密溝通的同時，金管局將就投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準提供進一步指引。這將涵蓋多個範疇，包括與虛擬資產相關的投資服務，以及銷售「保險掛鈎計劃」（Protection Linked Plans），這是一類新的投資連繫保險計劃，具備較高的保險保障水平。金管局、保險業監管局及強積金計劃管理局將聯合作動，針對符合資格的即期年金保單及稅務扣減自願性供款，對中介機構的銷售手法進行神秘顧客調查。\n\n隨着跨境WMC順利啓動，香港金管局將會繼續與業界及相關監管機構合作，以優化此計劃。\n\n此外，金管局將着手準備，根據新的《監管手冊》模組及新的《操守準則》監管人工智能信託業務。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監管\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》(PSSVFO)、金融市場基礎設施原則(PFMI)1，以及支付與市場基礎設施委員會(CPMI)發出的各項指引，促進其監管下的金融市場基礎設施(FMI)的安全和效率。香港金融管理局將會因應最新的科技和市場發展，不斷完善金融市場基礎設施的監管框架。\n\n香港金融管理局將與金融市場基礎設施機構合作，確保它們遵守《金融穩定理事會的金融市場基礎設施原則》（PFMI），並會根據需要進行和更新評估。此外，香港金融管理局將繼續參與金融穩定理事會－國際證券事務委員會（CPMI-IOSCO）的 PFMI 實施監測和評估工作。香港金融管理局亦會參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並根據市場和科技發展以及國際慣例，加強其監管要求。香港金融管理局會與相關當局合作，在適當情況下進一步加強合作監管安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續完善及精煉其銀行監理和監管框架及政策，並會參考國際標準和最佳實務。\n\n# 香港實施巴塞爾協議\n\n# 資本標準\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續完善資本框架，具體包括近年來銀行監理委員會（巴塞爾委員會）所發布的以下標準：\n\n二零一三年十二月銀行對基金的股權投資資本要求（EIF 標準），將於二零二二年七月一日生效，隨《銀行業（資本）（修訂）規則》二零二二年版在立法會完成負面審查後生效實施。\n\n2017年12月巴塞爾協議III後危機改革最終版本、2019年1月市場風險最低資本要求（2019年2月修訂）、以及2020年7月信用風險價值調整風險框架有針對性的修訂，合稱為「巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案」。 這些修訂後的資本標準闡述了對信用風險、市場風險、信用風險價值調整（CVA）風險和操作風險的修訂後的資本處理方式，引入了產出下限要求，並加強了槓桿比率框架。 目前正在諮詢業界意見，準備對銀行（資本）規則（BCR）進行修訂，以便自2023年7月1日起生效作為最低要求（市場風險和CVA風險2除外）。\n\n鑒於銀行資本充足率準則中對主權集中風險的資本處理方式旨在補充巴塞爾銀行監管委員會的大額風險暴露框架，以及銀行（風險限額）規則的實施情況，金管局將會同步提出對資本規則的修訂，以配合銀行（風險限額）規則的相關變更。\n\n# 暴露限值\n\n香港金融管理局將繼續與業界及律政司協商擬定的《銀行（風險限額）規則》修訂案，目標實施日期與巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案的實施日期一致，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 公開標準\n\n與巴塞爾協議 III 最後一輪改革方案中修訂後的資本標準相關的新增或修改披露要求，主要載於巴塞爾銀行監管委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發佈的《支柱三披露要求 – 修訂框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》。巴塞爾銀行監管委員會亦於2019年6月發佈《槓桿比率披露要求修訂》，修訂槓桿比率的披露要求，以解決對潛在「粉飾」行為的擔憂（即銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的數量，以人為地提高其槓桿比率以供報告及公開披露）。為實施這些新增或修改的披露要求，香港金融管理局亦正在準備對《銀行（披露）規則》的相應修訂，目標是在與相關修訂後的資本標準相同的時間表內在香港生效。\n\n# 其他監督政策及風險管理指引\n\n為配合監管規定及國際標準的發展，香港金融管理局計劃更新若干《銀行業實務守則》（SPM）章節，包括與巴塞爾協議III最終改革方案中修訂後的資本及披露標準、關於實施逆周期資本緩衝的辦法、「銀行簿記的利率風險」、「新股認購及股份質押融資」和「壓力測試」相關的章節。香港金融管理局亦會繼續致力修訂《操守準則》及《銀行條例下認可機構外部審計師報告要求》相關的SPM章節，目標是在2022年內完成修訂。鑒於《銀行（風險限額）規則》的建議修訂，相關的行為準則及SPM章節，例如關於「大額風險及風險集中」的CR-G-8，以及關於「關連方風險」的CR-G-9，將會相應地更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n憑藉強勁的商品出口、復甦的內需以及政府支持政策措施的提振，香港經濟在2021年重拾正增長，扭轉了2019年和2020年經歷的萎縮。勞動力市場亦有所改善，通脹保持溫和，儘管略有上升。雖然預期經濟在第五波新冠疫情緩和後將繼續復甦，但其力度和速度仍存在不確定性和風險，特別是與疫情以及美國貨幣政策正常化的進程相關的因素。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n受惠於強勁的商品出口和改善的本地需求，香港經濟在2021年增長了6.3%，結束了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮（表1和圖1）。 私人消費因勞動市場狀況改善以及政府消費券計劃的推動而恢復。 整體投資支出也隨著商業環境和前景好轉而反彈。 對外方面，香港的商品出口全年錄得強勁增長，部分得益於全球經濟持續復甦。 服務出口錄得溫和增長，反映了活躍的區域貿易和貨物流動，以及更強勁的跨境商業和金融活動。 總進口顯著增加，主要是由於本地需求和轉口需求增加所致。 總體而言，外部貿易在2021年對實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長作出了積極貢獻（圖1），因為總出口增長速度快於進口。\n\n表 1 按支出分項的實際國內生產毛額增長率（期間變動）\n\n請注意：經季節性調整後，按季變動的國內固定資本形成總額變動率暫未提供。資料來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在年內略有上升，但仍屬溫和。撇除政府一次性救濟措施的影響，按年計的基礎通脹率在十二月份溫和上升至1.4%（圖表2）。由於本地消費需求改善，餐飲、交通、衣物及鞋類等消費品價格重新回升。在環球供應鏈瓶頸以及國際能源及商品價格飆升的影響下，進口價格亦顯著上升。另一方面，房屋價格對整體通脹構成拖累，反映早前私人住宅新租賃價格下跌的影響（圖表2）。更廣泛地說，名義工資和商業租金增長緩慢，有助於抑制本地企業的成本壓力。整體而言，2021年基礎及綜合通脹率分別維持在溫和的0.6%和1.6%。\n\n圖表 2 潛在消費者物價通脹\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n與國內經濟復甦同步，2021年勞動市場有所改善。失業率在二月份達到17年高位的7.2%後，於十二月顯著下降至4.0%（圖表3），且降幅涵蓋大部分經濟部門。整體勞動力需求隨著總就業人數增加（圖表3）和私營部門職位空缺的增加而逐步增強，儘管仍低於疫情前的高峰。另一方面，勞動力供應在十二月較去年同期略微減少1.3%，部分原因是勞動力參與率溫和下降。2021年前三季名義工資和勞動收入的同比增長雖然溫和，但顯示出加速跡象，扭轉了2019年至2020年期間的減速趨勢。\n\n圖表三 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：香港特別行政區政府統計處。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n雖然部分主要海外股權市場持續反彈（圖表4），但本地股市在年內整體表現疲軟。 恆生指數延續2020年末的反覆回升，於2021年2月17日升至31,085點的高位，但此後因多項因素影響，市場情緒急劇轉為負面，包括對新型新冠病毒變種的擔憂、主要央行可能收緊貨幣政策，以及透過滬港通南向交易的資金流入減少。 恆生指數以23,398點收市，較去年大幅下跌14.1%。\n\n圖表 4 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部與香港交易所。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n隨著經濟前景好轉，住宅物業市場在2021年上半年重拾升勢，但在下半年因資產市場情緒轉弱而出現整固（圖表4）。整體而言，2021年房屋價格和交易量分別錄得增長3.7%和24.1%。家庭負擔能力亦進一步下降，部分原因反映家庭收入減少。另一方面，經歷了2019年和2020年的大幅調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍改善，工業物業的價格和租金普遍回升至疫情前的高峰水平，而零售和辦公空間的價格則仍未達到各自的峰值。\n\n請參閱第326至327頁的表B：主要經濟指標，以了解更多詳情，包括2017年至2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n於二零二二年年初，第五波本地新冠肺炎疫情對本地經濟活動造成壓力。為此，政府推出第五及第六輪「抗疫基金」，並在二零二二至二零二三年度財政預算案下增加逆周期措施，以協助支持經濟。香港金融管理局與銀行業界亦將「預先批准還款寬限計劃」延長至二零二二年十月底。\n\n整體而言，預期2022年經濟將持續復甦，但相較於2021年，增長步伐將較為溫和，部分原因在於第五波新冠疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、基數效應減弱以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年實質國內生產總值（GDP）增長率將介於1%至2%之間，而國際組織和私人分析師最新的增長預測平均為1.1%。儘管如此，復甦的強度和速度仍受多種不確定性和風險影響，特別是與疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化路徑相關的因素。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n與進口價格上漲及疫情引發的物流中斷同時，預期短期內通脹壓力將略微上升，但由於租金溫和以及本地勞工成本壓力不大，整體應可大致受到控制。市場普遍預測2022年整體通脹率為2.4%，而政府則預測整體及核心通脹率分別為2.1%和2.0%。2022年初，第五波本地新冠肺炎感染病例對勞動力市場造成壓力，尤其是在人際接觸頻繁的行業。更長遠來看，勞動力市場狀況將取決於疫情發展和本地經濟復甦的速度。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業於二零二一年繼續保持穩定。銀行總資產適度增長，貸款和存款均有增加。銀行業的資本和流動資金狀況依然穩健。資產質素無論從歷史或國際標準來看，均保持在健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業資產負債表於2021年增長了1.9%。 受到經濟復甦的帶動，全年的總貸款錄得3.8%的增長，較2020年的1.2%有所提升。 其中，用於香港的貸款增長了4.4%，用於香港以外的貸款增長了1.1%，貿易融資則增長了14.2%。 與中國大陸相關的貸款在2021年擴大3.6%，此前在2020年基本保持穩定。\n\n負債方面，2021年總存款增長4.6%，較2020年的5.4%有所放緩。由於總存款增長速度快於總貸款，整體貸款存款比率在2021年底下降至71.8%，較一年前的72.3%略有降低（圖表5）。\n\n圖表 5 銀行業貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局。\n\n# 資本適足性\n\n銀行業的資本狀況保持良好。於2021年底，本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本充足比率為20.2%。一級資本比率為18.2%（圖表6）。 兩項比率均遠高於國際最低要求分別為8%和6%。\n\n巴塞爾協議三的槓桿比率在2021年底為7.9%，遠高於法定的最低要求3%（圖表7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況良好。2021年第四季，第一類金融機構8的平均流動性覆蓋率（LCR）為151.9%，表現良好。\n\n高於法定最低要求的百分之百。第二類金融機構的季度平均流動性維持比率（LMR）為59.1%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的百分之二十五（圖表8）。\n\n圖表 8 指定人工智能的流動性比率\n資料來源：香港金融管理局。\n\n銀行業的資金來源保持穩定。一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）在2021年底為135.3%，遠高於法定的最低要求100%。核心資金\n\n類別2A機構的資本充足率（CFR）於2021年底為150.3%，亦遠高於法定的最低要求75%（圖表9）。\n\n圖表9 指定人工智能的資金比率\n資料來源：金管局。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n資產質素在年內保持穩定，並按歷史標準及國際標準維持在健康水平。截至2021年底，不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所改善；逾期及重組貸款比率則由年內的0.57%輕微下降至0.56%（圖表10）。與中國內地相關的貸款不良貸款比率，於2021年底為0.86%，較2020年底的0.96%下降。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然維持在低水平，分別為0.04%及0.20%（圖表11）。金管局將繼續密切監察銀行業資產質素的變化。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n低利率環境持續影響銀行業的盈利能力。 零售銀行2021年總計稅前營運利潤下降19.8%（圖12），主要歸因於淨利息收入減少（-13.6%）及總營運費用增加（+7.1%）。 手續費及佣金收入增加（+9.6%）和貸款減損損失減少（-25.1%）在一定程度上抵銷了上述影響。 淨利息差從2020年的1.18%進一步收窄至2021年的0.98%（圖13）。\n\n零售銀行的成本收入比率在2021年上升至54.7%，較2020年的47.0%有所提高（圖表14）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900 views.\n\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠疫情仍然存在不確定性，且對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮日益增加，香港的港元外匯和貨幣市場仍然保持平穩有序的運作。自1983年實施以來，作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯匯制度已展現出其抵禦外部衝擊的實力和韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這指的是港幣兌美元在港幣7.75至7.85兌1美元的區間內，於外匯市場保持穩定的外匯價值。 貨幣制度的結構以聯繫匯率制度為特色，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有100%的美元儲備於外匯基金作支持，而貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對等。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表 1）包括：\n\n債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供十足擔保；政府發行的流通貨幣紙幣及硬幣；結算戶口餘額總和，即於金管局所持結算戶口餘額之總額；以及由金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及儲蓄券。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，仰賴自動調整利率機制的運作，以及香港金融管理局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）。當強方或弱方承諾被觸發時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求，以每美元7.75元或7.85元的價格買入或賣出港元，從而擴大或縮減結餘，以壓低或提高港元利率，協助港元匯率重回7.75至7.85元的聯繫匯率區間。\n\n# 二零二一年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n受惠於資金籌集活動及「深港通」南向交易帶來的需求，年初港元匯率一度接近強方兌換率上限。其後，受股市回調及部分新上市企業首次公開募股（IPO）所得資金回流影響，港元匯率一度走弱，但在第二季因企業股息支付需求及「深港通」南向資金淨流入而略有反彈。步入下半年，雖然港元匯率在股市情緒轉淡下有所下跌，但整體而言仍維持在可兌換約束區間強方，並繼續保持平穩有序的交易狀況（圖一）。總體而言，2021年港元外匯市場運作暢通。\n\n圖表 1：2021年市場匯率\n\n由於未觸發逆周期緩衝資本（CUs），集體結餘與未償還的交換基金票據（EFBN）總額在2021年幾乎維持不變，約為1.5263萬億港元（圖表2）。年內，金管局共發行額外800億港元交換基金票據，以滿足銀行體系充裕的流動性下對交換基金票據的持續需求，導致集體結餘由2020年末的4575億港元收縮至2021年末的3775億港元。\n\n反映了根據既定慣例發行額外交換基金票據及發行盈餘票據以吸納盈餘票據的利息支出，本年度未償還的盈餘票據由1,069.2億港元增加至1,148.8億港元。貨幣基礎整體而言仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 港幣1兆5263億元\n\n總結餘額及未償餘額的有效銀行承兌票據\n\n圖表 2：2021年綜合結餘（未扣除再貼現窗口）及未償還之交換基金票據\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n憑藉龐大的結餘，港元同業拆息在全年內大致維持在低水平的穩定狀態（圖表3）。雖然第一季首次公開招股（IPO）活動帶動了對港元的需求增加，但各期限的香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）變動不大。此後，儘管市場對美國貨幣緊縮的速度表示擔憂，HIBOR仍大致保持穩定。在2021年末，HIBOR略有上升，部分反映了對年底資金需求的預期。在零售方面，銀行維持其最佳貸款利率不變。總體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。2021年再貼現窗口借款減少至68億港元，較2020年的91億港元減少。\n\n圖表三：二零二一年香港銀行同業拆息利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯繫匯率制度）在過去三十多年一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並已證明其在應對挑戰方面的實力和韌性。儘管全球經濟復甦仍存在不確定性，但香港的港元外匯和貨幣市場繼續有序運作，反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。政府堅定致力於維持聯繫匯率制度。國際貨幣基金會在2021年《對外部門報告》中再次重申，聯繫匯率制度的可信度已得到一套透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、嚴格的金融監管與審慎的經濟結構和謹慎的財政框架的保證。\n\n健全的銀行體系對於聯動早期警示系統的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行業持續運作暢順，流動性狀況及資本充足率均遠超國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試的結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管力度。\n\n為提高外匯基金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分指定用於支持貨幣基礎。於2021年，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在109.8%至110.5%的區間內，未觸及上下限觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率收報110.2%（圖表4）。根據聯動匯率制度，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可動用以支持港元匯率。外匯基金充裕的財政資源，加上穩健的銀行體系，為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供了強有力的後盾。\n\n圖表 4：2021 年背書比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣局小組委員會\n\n貨幣政策諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣板子委員會（編委會）監察和檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2021年，編委會審議的議題包括評估美國的通脹情況、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估「縮減恐慌」風險及其對香港的影響，以及了解與內地相關資金流向對香港貨幣狀況的影響。編委會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予編委會的貨幣板運作報告，均已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n於2021年底，由票據發行銀行發行的在流通紙幣總值為5926億港元，較一年前增加5.9%（圖表5、6及7）。政府發行的紙幣及硬幣在流通總值於2021年底達129億港元，較去年同期增加1.7%（圖表8及9）。\n\n# 港幣5926億元，增長5.9%\n\n發行銀行所發行紙幣總值\n\n# 港幣129億元，增長1.7%\n\n政府發行紙幣及硬幣總值\n\n# 圖表五\n\n於二零二一年底由發行銀行流通中的紙幣\n\n# 圖表六\n\n截至2021年底流通紙幣分佈\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n年內，香港金融管理局舉辦了14個研討會，共有超過4,000名參加者，包括銀行業和零售業的專業人士以及學生，旨在幫助他們提升辨識真偽港幣的知識和技能。這些關於香港紙幣設計和安全特點的公眾教育活動反應良好。\n\n# 錢幣收藏計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到公眾歡迎。有關該計劃的更多資訊，請參閱第198頁的「可持續發展」章節。\n\n# 匯豐票據及儲蓄紙幣\n\n拓展票據計劃運作暢順。為配合銀行體系充裕的流動資金，並滿足銀行對外匯基金票據的持續需求，金管局於2021年下半年發行額外800億港元的外匯基金票據。額外發行導致總結餘相應減少。截至2021年底，未償還的外匯基金票據的總面值為1,148.6億港元（表2）。\n\n表 2 結餘票據及票據未解決問題\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融管理局紀律院（金研院）在2021年即使在疫情持續期間，仍保持穩定的研究成果。年內，金研院發表了30篇工作論文，並舉辦了九個網絡研討會，涵蓋了廣泛的主題，包括貨幣政策、銀行穩定性、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展。金研院亦組織了一場國際會議及一個混合模式的網絡研討會。\n\n網誌「人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望」於八月十七日與香港金融學院聯合舉辦。活動透過多個線上平台進行直播，共吸引超過一百一十六萬的即時觀看次數。\n\n第十一屆國際中華經濟論壇於十一月十一日舉行，主題為「走向共同富裕：中國雙循環經濟發展之路」。論壇探討了近期與共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷法規、房地產市場、跨境財富管理互聯互通以及大灣區金融發展相關的最新政策動態。多位專家學者亦就人口老化及社會保障基金的可持續性，以及中國對全球金融穩定和世界經濟的貢獻等議題進行了深入分析。本次論壇共設六個分場，吸引了超過三千二百名線上及現場觀眾，總觀看次數達五千九百次。\n\n"}

During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在2021年保持穩健及穩定，即使出現更具傳染性的新冠病毒變種，為全球經濟復甦帶來不確定性。年內，香港金融管理局繼續專注於監察認可機構的風險管理。鑑於網絡威脅日益增加以及銀行業加速數碼化，對認可機構的營運及網絡安全韌性監管亦隨之加強。\n\n在行為監理方面，金管局向銀行提供指引，以便利銀行利用非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作制定市場上新產品（例如與保險掛鈎證券及虛擬資產）的監理要求。銀行行為準則亦已修訂，以加強數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（反洗錢／打擊恐怖融資）方面，金管局的首要任務是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中的守門人角色，以及它們預防和偵測與疫情期間網絡詐騙、傀儡戶網絡和其他金融犯罪增加相關的非法資金流動的能力。為提高客戶帳戶免受詐騙和金融犯罪的保障，金管局透過公私合作加強與其他利益相關者的合作和資訊共享。在支持遠程客戶開戶的同時，金管局亦鼓勵採用其他技術，包括網絡分析，並於十一月推出首個反洗錢科技實驗室。在國際層面，積極參與使金管局在金融行動專案組的全球反洗錢／打擊恐怖融資工作中保持領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區「跨境理財通」試點計劃於九月順利啟動。年內，香港金融管理局繼續推行其為期兩年的促進金融科技應用路線圖。正如可持續發展章節所述，多項舉措已推出，旨在為銀行建立氣候風險管理基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色和可持續銀行業務。此外，也在軟性基礎設施方面加強努力，包括推廣以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出能力建設舉措，以促進人才發展。\n\n與此同時，香港金融管理局與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監理政策和流程。在本地實施國際監理標準方面取得了良好進展，當中包括資本充足率和資訊披露等。金管局繼續推進工作，以確保認可機構擁有可信的決策機制，包括制定新的決策標準，並實施有關虧損吸收能力的要求，以提升認可機構的可決解性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。實現此目標取決於一個具備高度韌性的金融體系，能夠為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式，甚至在極端情況下通過混亂倒閉，可能影響體系穩定。作為監管機構，貨幣當局在維護金融穩定方面扮演著關鍵角色，透過確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止破產。貨幣當局負責對銀行進行審慎監理，並負責授權香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。\n\n然而，金管局無法保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決機構，致力於確保當認可的金融機構（AI）出現非可行情況時，其破產能夠以有序的方式處理。為此，香港已建立金融機構解決機制，其中金管局是認可的金融機構等不同類型機構的解決機構。為了有效推行香港的解決機制，制定解決規則和政策標準、進行解決規劃以消除認可的金融機構可解決性的障礙，以及發展金管局處理破產認可的金融機構的運營能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採取與國際接軌且協調一致的方法。\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責指定及監管若干金融市場基礎設施（金融市場基礎設施）。在監管金融市場基礎設施方面，金管局旨在提升其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。提升金融市場基礎設施應對金融危機的能力，可保障香港的貨幣及金融系統免受金融市場基礎設施中斷可能帶來的破壞性影響。有關金管局監管方法的資料，可在金管局網站上查閱。\n\n# 二零二一年回顧\n\n# 授權許可\n\n於二零二一年底，香港擁有：\n\n年內，金管局向三間非本地銀行批出兩張銀行牌照及一張受限制銀行牌照。金管局亦批准一間外地交易平台營運商從事貨幣經紀業務。年內，三間持牌銀行及兩間受限制牌照銀行的授權均被撤銷。\n\n更多關於人工智能及在香港的代表辦事處的資訊，請參閱第321至324頁的附件和表格D至F，以及第330至333頁的表格。\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n香港金融管理局進行了189項非實地覆核，涵蓋廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、企業管治、風險管理和金融科技（金融科技）策略。作為金管局持續努力加強風險管治的一部分，已與認可機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事級委員會舉行了40次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外部審計師之間又舉行了38次三方會議。\n\n除了場外活動外，香港金融管理局還定期進行現場檢查，並針對被評估為風險較高的領域進行主題審查。本年度共進行了679項現場檢查和主題審查，重點關注信用風險管理。隨着銀行採用科技日益普及，營運風險和科技風險的管理成為另一個主要關注領域。香港金融管理局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場檢查和主題審查次數。此外，專門小組還對證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務中人工智能（AI）的活動，以及它們的反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）控制進行了現場檢查和主題審查。表1載列了香港金融管理局於2021年的監管活動摘要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n總貸款於2021年增長了3.8%，較2020年的1.2%增長率為高。表2顯示貸款和墊款增長情況的細分。\n\n與內地相關的貸款於2021年增加3.6%，達4,725億港元（表3）。\n\n銀行業資產素質在年內大致保持穩定，無論從歷史數據或國際標準來看，均處於健康水平。 截至2021年底，行業不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值1.8%。與中國大陸相關的貸款比率亦由去年的0.96%下降至0.86%。\n\n年內，新冠疫情持續影響部分經濟領域，而內地房地產市場的信用事件亦引起市場關注。金管局加強及深化監察工作，重點審視銀行對高槓桿借款人的風險敞口。金管局與銀行保持緊密溝通，以便及時評估經濟和市場發展的影響，以及銀行風險管理措施的充分性。銀行業整體信用風險被評估為可控。金管局最新的償付能力壓力測試結果證實，銀行業繼續維持充足的資本緩衝，以應對極端壓力。\n\n本年度進行了有針對性和主題性的檢查，以評估人工智能系統在貸款分類和壞賬準備金、海外貸款業務以及為私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的抵押貸款方面的控制和管理制度。\n\n# 舒緩客戶現金流壓力\n\n九月，香港金融管理局與銀行界中小企業信貸協調機制宣布將「預先批准本金還款寬限期計劃」延長六個月，至二零二二年四月底。此計劃於二零二零年五月首次推出，旨在為合資格企業客戶延遲償還貸款本金六個月。鑑於本地新冠病毒感染病例反覆，於二零二二年二月，該計劃進一步延長至二零二二年十月底。此外，該計劃亦已優化，為有能力並願意逐步恢復償還本金的客戶提供為期一年的部分本金還款選項。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准超過8.3萬宗貸款延期及其他舒緩措施，涉及總額超過9200億港元。 其中，針對個人客戶方面，銀行已批准超過5.2萬宗住宅按揭及其他個人貸款的本金還款假期，涉及金額超過530億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局陸續推出的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已加強銀行風險管理能力，以及銀行業對本地房地產市場可能突然轉跌的抵禦力。於2021年12月批准的新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率為53%，較首次推出逆周期措施前的2009年9月的64%為低。2021年12月新按揭貸款的平均債務收入比率維持在36%的低水平，較首次實施債務收入比率上限的2010年8月的41%為低（圖表1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n鑒於銀行越來越依賴科技支援其營運，香港金融管理局加強了對營運及科技風險的監管。本年度監管重點包括對雲端外包和遠程工作安排的控制。香港金融管理局於十二月就一份關於「營運韌性」的全新《監理政策手冊》（SPM）草案模組展開業界諮詢。這份新的SPM模組旨在為銀行提供有關建立全面且整合的營運韌性框架的指引。\n\n香港金融管理局於一月推出《網絡應變能力評估框架2.0》，以反映最新的網絡安全風險管理良好慣例。年內，金管局監察各認可金融機構實施《網絡應變能力評估框架2.0》的情況，並審視其網絡應變能力。鑑於具破壞性的網絡攻擊風險日益增加，金管局於五月要求所有認可金融機構嚴格評估設立安全三級數據備份的必要性，並可參考香港銀行協會發布的《安全三級數據備份指引》。\n\n為應對日益嚴峻的風險和不斷增加的網絡釣魚攻擊，香港金融管理局與業界緊密合作，加強互聯網及手機銀行服務的安全性。香港金融管理局與香港銀行公會於七月展開一項大規模聯合公眾意識宣傳活動，主題為「保護您的個人數碼鑰匙；提防欺詐連結！」（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 提高公眾對網路釣魚攻擊的意識\n\n保護您的個人數位金鑰；小心詐騙連結！\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n為加強監察人工智能中介機構的流動風險敞口，金管局在其流動性壓力測試框架中加入了額外情境，以評估這些機構應對長時間流動衝擊的能力。\n\n年內，已進行主題審查，以評估認可金融機構的流動性壓力測試計劃的充分性，並評估其監控指標及控制限額在管理流動性風險方面的有效性。香港金融管理局亦已進行審查，以評估認可金融機構在債券投資方面的市場風險管理框架的有效性，以及對庫務活動的作業控制。\n\n香港金融管理局密切監察認可機構為應對倫敦銀行同業拆息 (LIBOR) 的轉變所做的準備工作。金管局與業界協會合作，並開發工具協助認可機構支持其客戶轉移至另類參考利率，包括一份旨在提高企業意識的簡介，以及一份關於可用於取代美元 LIBOR 的貸款市場選項的資訊備忘錄。認可機構已大幅修訂參照已於2021年底停止公布的LIBOR設定的合約。金管局提醒認可機構自2022年1月1日起，不得再訂立新的LIBOR合約。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n於二零二一年，香港金融管理局透過多管齊下，在鞏固香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得了顯著進展。\n\n香港金融管理局公布「金融科技2025」策略，旨在推廣金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並進一步鞏固香港作為金融科技中心的地位。在快速支付系統方面，受新冠疫情影響，本年度交易額顯著增加。\n\n在提升互聯互通方面，本年度取得了顯著進展，新增了「跨境財富管理互聯互通」和「債券通南向交易」機制，豐富了「互聯互通」計劃的內容。 憑藉世界一流的市場基礎設施和「互聯互通」機制，香港成為內地資金參與全球市場，以及國際投資者進入快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n此外，二零二一年，金管局致力於拓展新的業務機會，以強化香港金融平台的競爭力，重點領域包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業資金庫中心以及綠色和可持續金融。為推廣香港金融服務，金管局加強與海外及內地各方的聯繫，讓他們了解香港金融體系的韌性及其所提供的機遇。\n\n與此同時，香港金融管理局積極參與國際及區域性的中央銀行和監管論壇，致力於全球維護金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的努力。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局公布了其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列推廣金融科技廣泛應用，以及鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位的舉措。 金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與銀行部門攜手合作，在今年積極推動多項重要舉措，包括以下內容：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）應用\n推出科技基線評估，以了解銀行採用金融科技的情況\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的地位依然穩固，年內相關業務錄得顯著增長。 隨著主要金融市場指數持續納入在岸證券，流入人民幣資產的資金持續加速。香港在促進國際投資者增加對人民幣資產的配置方面扮演著不可或缺的角色，而「滬港通」及「深港通」計劃被廣泛視為國際投資者進入在岸資本市場的首選渠道。 2021年，北向債券通每日成交額增長34%，達到約258億人民幣。\n\n繼北向債券通取得成功後，南向債券通於九月開通，從而實現了內地與國際債券市場之間的雙向互聯互通。同月，中國人民銀行、香港金融管理局及澳門貨幣暨金融管理局共同發布了《粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通計畫》（「跨境理財通」）的實施細則。十月，符合資格的香港銀行與其內地合作銀行一併開始提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為主要離岸人民幣業務中心的地位，香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和香港交易所（港交所）組成一個工作小組，以研究推動在香港交易以人民幣計價的股權證券的可行性。 此外，人民銀行與香港金融管理局於十二月聯合舉辦了一場研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心和領先人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金融管理局持續致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。尤其在增加香港作為基金註冊地的吸引力方面，金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，為基金成立提供更便利的稅務和監管環境。在進一步提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位，以及債券發行中心方面，亦取得了顯著進展。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n安全及高效的金融基礎設施運作，對於鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的領先地位至關重要。 於2021年，四個銀行間即時總結算（RTGS）系統、中央資金市場單位（CMU）及香港貿易庫存庫均實現了100%¹的系統可用性，超越了99.95%的目標。 隨着九月份「南向通」的推出，中央資金市場單位成為「北向通」及「南向通」項下交易的結算及保管服務供應商。\n\n快速支付系統的採用率於2021年持續擴展。截至2021年底，註冊人數增至960萬，年度平均每日交易額較2020年上升90%。除了個人對個人和企業支付穩定增長外，使用快速支付系統繳納政府賬單、商家付款以及充值儲值設施（SVF）電子錢包或銀行帳戶是推動交易量持續上升的主要因素。\n\n為提升本地零售支付行業的安全及效率，金管局監察六個指定零售支付系統，並根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監理十五間持牌儲值設施營運者。年內，金管局透過協調及促進相關政府部門與獲委任參與消費券計劃的儲值設施營運者之間的對話與合作，確保政府消費券計劃順利實施。\n\n於二零二二年一月，香港金融管理局發佈了一份關於加密資產及穩定幣的討論文件，闡述了金管局對相關監管方法的思考，並邀請各利益相關者發表意見。在制定適當的監管制度時，將會考慮相關因素，包括對此討論文件的回饋意見以及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n在國際層面，香港金融管理局是中央銀行界積極的成員，並在多個區域性和國際委員會中扮演領導角色。例如，香港金融管理局主持東亞太平洋中央銀行主管會議（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）2。香港金融管理局亦與巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）的政策與標準組、非銀行監察專家小組，以及金融穩定委員會（FSB）的金融創新網絡共同主持，並領導一個團隊研究與金融基準轉型相關的監管問題。\n\n# 二零二一年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技中心\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n六月份，香港金融管理局揭示了其「金融科技2025」策略，以推動香港金融科技發展。該策略旨在鼓勵金融界在2025年前全面採用科技，並促進提供公平且高效的金融服務，以惠及香港市民和經濟。該策略的五個重點領域是：\n\n所有銀行轉型金融科技\n為央行數位貨幣（CBDC）預備香港未來\n打造新一代數據基礎設施\n擴展具備金融科技知識的專業人才隊伍\n透過資金和政策扶持生態系統發展\n\n香港金管局「金融科技2025」策略推動香港金融科技發展。\n\n# 金融科技在銀行業的應用\n\n為配合「金融科技2025」策略的「銀行業全面轉型金融科技」倡議，香港金融管理局於2021年6月推出科技基線評估。此評估旨在協助金管局更深入了解銀行業現行的金融科技發展狀況，並識別金管局可能需要提供支援的金融科技領域。所有於香港有重要業務的持牌銀行，均被要求於2021年底前制定為期三年的金融科技應用計劃。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局亦繼續推行為期兩年的路線圖，以促進銀行在香港採納監管科技，並在其自身的監管流程中融入科技，以提升效率和效能。詳情請參閱銀行穩定性專章第98頁。\n\n# 批發央行數位貨幣\n\n香港金融管理局與泰國銀行於2021年2月擴大其聯合研究項目範圍，納入阿拉伯聯合大公國中央銀行及中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所參與。該項目易名為「多央行數字貨幣橋樑（mBridge）」, 並獲得銀行國際結算中心（BIS）香港創新中心的大力支持，旨在進一步探討分散式帳本技術在多司法管轄區及24\/7全天候環境下，促進即時跨境外匯交易的「支付對沖」（PvP）。 項目於九月發表聯合報告，匯報中期成果，隨後於十一月發布潛在應用案例及未來路線圖。\n\n# 零售央行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在央行數字貨幣（CBDC）的準備方面面向未來，金管局已開始研究在香港發行零售CBDC（即電子港元）的前景，涵蓋技術和政策方面的考慮。金管局與銀行國際結算中心（BIS）在香港的創新中心合作，展開「Aurum項目」，以探討發行零售CBDC的技術層面。此外，亦成立了一個內部跨部門工作小組，研究相關的技術、政策和法律問題。金管局於十月發布了一份題為《電子港元：技術視角》的技術白皮書，以探討並徵求對發行和分發零售CBDC的潛在技術設計方案的意見。\n\n此外，金管局支持中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所就跨境支付使用電子人民幣進行技術測試。這將有助於促進大灣區互聯互通，並通過提升跨境支付的效率和使用者體驗，為香港和內地遊客帶來更大的便利。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n七月，香港金融管理局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行和 SVF 營運商加入 CDI，這是一個下一代金融數據基礎設施，旨在提升銀行體系內更高效的金融中介。為進一步促進發展和應用，研討會上宣布推出 CDI 創新中心。為了便利中小企業融資，香港金融管理局完成了兩個階段的概念驗證研究，以評估 CDI 的技術可行性。研究期間，透過應用另類數據以促進信用評估和貸款承保，參與銀行批准了超過 550 筆總額超過 9 億港元的中小企業貸款。基於令人鼓舞的結果，香港金融管理局於十一月宣布 CDI 正式啟動試點計劃。\n\n中小企業主讚揚信貸資料庫簡化了他們的貸款申請流程。\n\n# 人才發展\n\n為擴大金融科技人才庫，金管局繼續與其策略合作夥伴共同推行金融科技人才加速計劃2.0，以培養不同職涯階段的年輕人才。二零二一年，共有超過一百八十名學生受惠於此計劃。此外，業界項目碩士網絡計劃於九月試行，為修讀金融科技專業的碩士學生提供參與實際金融科技項目的機會。為建立策略合作夥伴關係，並促進包括金融科技人才發展在內各領域的合作，金管局於十月與四所本地大學簽署諒解備忘錄。\n\n香港金融管理局（金管局）行政總裁（金融基礎設施）鮑 Colin 先生（中）與四所本地大學簽署備忘錄儀式上。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）的使用量在年內持續增加。截至2021年12月底，自2016年推出以來，共有234個金融科技倡議試點項目獲准在FSS內進行測試，較2020年底的193個有所增加。截至2021年12月底，金管局自2017年推出「沙盒聊天室」以來，已收到總共666份要求，以在金融科技項目早期階段獲得監管意見。超過63%的聊天室要求來自科技公司。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場於二零二一年開始復甦。儘管全球經濟持續受到不斷演變的 COVID-19 疫情影響，但多項因素，包括疫苗接種率提高以及世界各地寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施，都有助於全球經濟和金融市場顯著復甦。在此背景下，多個海外股市在年內創下歷史新高，而儘管香港股市表現疲軟，但外匯基金的整體股權投資仍能取得不俗的回報。二零二一年，外匯基金錄得投資收入為港幣 1919 億元，投資回報率為 4.1%。\n\n# 結匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》的規定，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯價。該基金亦可被用來維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局在財政司司長委託權限下，並在委託條款的範圍內，就外匯基金的使用和投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 結匯基金管理制度\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n匯豐顧問委員會（EFAC）為外匯基金設定了以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 以保本為首要目標；\n(ii) 確保貨幣基礎於任何時候均以高度流通的美元計值資產充分支持；\n(iii) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合(i)至(iii)的前提下，達致投資回報，以協助維持結匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已融入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置（圖一）。\n\n圖 1 交易所基金投資組合分類\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金主要由兩個投資組合構成：儲備投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。儲備投資組合持有高度流通的以美元計價資產，以符合聯繫匯率制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供十足的 backing。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員經濟體的債券和股權市場，以保值並維持其資產的長期購買力。\n\n為更有效地管理風險並提升中長期的回報，金管局會以審慎及漸進的方式，將部分外匯基金的投資分散到更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票的投資於投資組合中持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則於長期增長投資組合（LTGP）中持有。自LTGP成立以來，金管局已設立上限1以指導LTGP的多元化進程。隨著LTGP的投資規模和資產多樣性日益成熟，外匯基金諮詢委員會於2022年1月決定以目標資產配置取代上限，該配置與其他資產類別的配置同時決定，並受審慎風險管理原則約束。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的策略性目的而購入。由於其獨特性質，策略投資組合並未納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 與外匯基金的職位\n\n交換基金不時會接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。 利率一般與投資組合第二期（IP2）的表現掛鈎，但未來基金則為主要例外，其利率根據投資組合的配置比例，與投資組合（IP）及長期增值計劃（LTGP）的回報率掛鈎。 2021年，未來基金在投資組合（IP）與長期增值計劃（LTGP）之間的配置比例約為40比60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表外匯基金的投資目標所決定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以嘗試超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置經常與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。基準和追蹤誤差限制由財政司司長在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後決定，而戰術決策和戰術偏離的容許範圍則由金管局在授權下制定和設定。在容許的戰術偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可採取倉位以利用短期市場波動（圖 2）。\n\n圖 2 交易所基金資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局的交換基金投資事務處負責其投資及相關風險管理職能。交換基金投資事務處人員直接管理交換基金約71%的投資，包括全部的本金部分及部分投資組合。這部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的各類衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦會聘用外部基金經理管理約佔外匯基金資產29%的資金，其中包括其所有上市股權投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的，是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識以實現可持續回報，吸納多元且互補的投資風格，並獲取投資方面的市場洞察及技術專長。\n\n與外部經理人使用相關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本以及預扣及其他稅款。這些支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，更凸顯風險管理的重要性。香港金融管理局對內外管理的投資組合均設有嚴格的控制和投資指引，並確保建立完善的風險監控及合規系統。我們已建立三道防線，以有效執行風險管理和投資相關活動的治理。主要風險類別（包括信用風險、市場風險、流動性風險和營運風險）會定期監控，而風險管理流程為策略規劃和投資多元化提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局認為，透過適當重視負責任投資及可持續的長遠經濟表現，可更有效地實現交換基金的投資目標，並降低與其相關投資的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關風險。香港金融管理局支持負責任投資，將ESG因素融入交換基金的公共及私人市場投資流程，並以指導原則為基礎，即在長期風險調整後回報與其他投資相若的情況下，通常會優先考慮ESG投資。有關香港金融管理局負責任投資框架及實施的更多詳情，請參閱第184至191頁的「可持續發展」章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 二零二一年金融市場\n\n全球股市在超寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施的推動下大幅上漲並創下新高，帶動全球經濟和金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港和中國內地股市表現落後於市場改革的影響。美國標準普爾500指數上漲了27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌了14%。\n\n對於債券市場而言，通膨預期上升以及美國聯準會（Fed）縮減資產購置規模，導致2021年美國國債收益率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國債收益率從年初的0.9%上升至年底的1.5%，增幅約為60個基點。\n\n在外匯市場中，美元在2021年末，特別是隨著市場對聯準會縮減量化寬鬆預期的升溫，對其他主要貨幣走強。尤以歐元和日圓分別對美元貶值7.1%和10.3%為最顯著。\n\n表一顯示了2021年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。\n\n# 匯風基金表現\n\n於2021年，外匯基金錄得投資收入1919億港元。其中，債券收益為126億港元，股權淨收益為478億港元（海外股權收益688億港元，香港股權虧損210億港元），非港元資產的貨幣翻譯收益為168億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益為1147億港元。另，策略投資組合錄得估值收益31億港元。\n\n年末，外匯基金總資產達4,570.2億港元。 長期投資策略組合（LTGP）的投資市值總額為515.3億港元，其中私募股權為392.5億港元，房地產為122.8億港元。 長期投資策略組合（LTGP）的未償投資承諾為225.7億港元。\n\n二零二一年，交易所基金的投資回報率（不包括策略投資組合）為百分之四點一。具體而言，投資組合取得百分之三點七的回報率，而債券投資組合則增長百分之零點四。自二零零九年成立以來，長期增長計劃的內部收益率年化為百分之十五點四。\n\n於一九九四年至二零二一年期間，交易所基金的年度回報載於圖表一。表二顯示二零二一年的投資回報，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。二零一九年至二零二一年期間的平均回報為5.3%，二零一七年至二零二一年期間為4.7%，二零一二年至二零二一年期間為3.3%，自一九九四年以來則為4.8%。表三顯示基金於二零二一年十二月三十一日的貨幣組合。\n\n請參閱第211至319頁，以查閱外匯基金2021年度經審核財務報表。\n"}

A further 27 media interviews were arranged.  A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","zh":"# 公司職能\n\n公司職能運作支持香港金融管理局以高度透明、問責、效率和專業精神運作。為促進公眾對其政策和運作的理解，香港金融管理局透過傳統媒體、社交媒體、其網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社群和市場保持有效溝通。在機構內部，香港金融管理局致力培養具彈性和可持續發展的人力資源，實施嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以適應變化並確保其政策和倡議的有效實施。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度及增進公眾對其政策和運作的理解。二零二一年，金管局舉辦或參與了169項實體及虛擬活動，包括八次新聞發布會、八次即時專訪及153項其他公開活動。此外，又安排了27次傳媒專訪。全年在各媒體發布了共632份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的認知，特意為本地、內地及海外傳媒舉辦記者會及簡報會。議題涵蓋了互聯互通機制、金融科技（金融匯智）以及利率基準改革。\n\n為能及時與公眾互動交流，香港金融管理局維持五個社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter 及 YouTube），擁有超過八萬名追隨者。金管局利用這些社交媒體平台，提高公眾對各項議題的意識，尤其是在疫情期間顯著增加的網絡釣魚詐騙。此外，金管局亦透過社交媒體進行廣泛的宣傳活動，涵蓋綠色金融、金融科技及「通關」計劃等，讓公眾掌握最新發展趨勢。\n\n余偉文先生，香港金融管理局行政總裁，主持香港金融科技週2021的虛擬討論會。\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁李福 Edwina 主持新聞簡報會，講解金管局「金融科技2025」策略。\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁阮 Arthur 先生主持新聞簡報會，講解香港銀行界為倫敦銀行同業拆息轉型所做的準備。\n\n劉 Edmond 先生，香港金融管理局副行政總裁，接受一間國際新聞頻道訪問。\n\n# 公眾諮詢\n\n香港金融管理局公共查詢服務為市民提供一個有效途徑，以更深入了解金管局的主要職能和運作。二零二一年，該服務處理了九千七百八十一宗查詢。其中約一半與銀行政策及規例、個人銀行服務、紙幣及硬幣，以及金融基礎設施和債務市場發展有關。一些較為顯著的查詢涉及銀幣收集計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行相關指引及通函，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖表一顯示自2018年以來收到的公共查詢數量，而圖表二則提供2021年按查詢性質劃分的數據。\n\n圖表 1 公眾諮詢總數\n\n圖表 2：2021年收到的諮詢性質\n\n# 出版品\n\n除了《香港金融管理局年報》外，香港金融管理局還發佈了兩期《半年度金融及貨幣穩定報告》，以及四期《季刊》，並定期更新《每月統計通訊》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行和經濟狀況的最新及主題性資訊和分析。香港金融管理局亦發佈了11篇《inSight》文章，介紹其主要的新措施和政策，並探討熱門議題。\n\n香港金融管理局二零二零年年報在香港管理學會二零二一年最佳年報頒獎典禮中，於「非牟利及慈善機構」組別獲得銀獎，並在環境、社會及管治報告方面獲頒卓越獎。\n\n# 公司網站\n\n香港金融管理局的網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過四萬四千頁的英文、繁體中文和簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的主要途徑。 網站載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條規定維持的認可機構（「認可機構」）及本地代表辦事處登記冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》維持的儲值設施持牌人登記冊。\n\n香港金融管理局自2018年起分階段透過開放應用程式介面（API）在其網站上發布金融數據和重要資訊。截至2021年底，金管局已在其網站上開放了148組開放API，進度符合既定目標。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向公眾介紹金管局工作及提升市民對貨幣及銀行事務的認識的重要設施。資訊中心設有展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式呈現金管局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展概況。此外，中心亦提供香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務的相關資料和展品以供研究。圖書館毗鄰展覽區，藏有超過二萬六千冊關於香港貨幣、銀行和金融事務以及中央銀行議題的書籍、期刊及其他出版物。中心亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，備存認可機構及本地代表處的登記冊，以及認可機構證券人員的登記冊，供公眾查閱。\n\n為保障在新冠肺炎疫情期間的公共健康與安全，資訊中心已實施特別運作安排。加強清潔消毒工作，並定期以抗菌塗層對設施及展品進行衛生處理。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心的展覽區域包括政策展區、貨幣展區和歷史年表。\n\n# 社區參與及公眾教育\n\n為接觸社區並提高公眾對香港金融管理局工作的認知，自1998年起已持續推行公眾教育計劃。於2021年，為來自84所中學的逾2,300名學生及教師舉辦了一場網絡研討會。研討會涵蓋香港金融管理局的工作概覽、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數碼密匙的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的職業發展機會。至今，已有超過63,000人參與了這項公眾教育計劃。\n\n香港金融管理局致力教育及鼓勵市民成為精明負責任的金融消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙個案增加，金管局展開以「保護您的個人數碼鑰匙；提防欺詐連結！」為主題的公眾意識宣傳活動，並透過跨媒體推廣，呼籲市民提高警覺，留意假冒銀行發送的短信和電郵中的欺詐超連結。\n\n跨媒體宣傳提醒公眾提防詐騙連結\n\n香港金融管理局亦致力提升公眾對金融業界的認識，並提高年輕一代投身金融業的興趣。繼2020年網絡劇《STEPS》獲得廣泛好評後，金管局推出全新系列劇《中環四面才》，聚焦金融業界四個發展蓬勃的領域：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。劇中以幽默風趣的方式塑造金融從業員的角色，並由經驗豐富的業界領袖和年輕人才分享有關上述四個領域職務性質、要求、以及職業機會和前景的資訊。\n\n「中央人才四面睇」系列，讓年輕一代緊貼金融市場的職涯發展機會。\n\n「網上育兒及教育活動」於2020年推出，並在MarketingInteractive 2021年市場活動獎中，榮獲「最佳活動 — 企業社會責任」類別的銀獎。為延續活動的成功，並保持勢頭，香港管理學會推出更多配套措施，包括育兒理財教育工作坊，邀請兒童教育專家分享如何教導孩子正確的理財觀念，並示範自製理財教育玩具，以及香港管理學會資訊中心的動畫虛擬導覽。\n\n「線上育兒教育推廣活動」榮獲2021年市場活動獎。此活動旨在透過輕鬆有趣的方式，向家長和孩子推廣理財概念和技能。\n\n為提升中學生金融素養，香港金融管理局與各持份者合辦「香港金融素養錦標賽」，並以金融科技為主題。除了網上測驗外，更增設個人財務管理金融設計思維工作坊，訓練參與學生設計創新的理財工具方案。此舉榮獲教育局「商校合作計劃」頒發的「學生參與度最高獎」，以及投資及財務教育委員會頒發的「投資及財務教育獎（企業）—黃金獎」。\n\n「香港金融素養錦標賽」向學生普及金融科技和設計思維概念，並創下歷來最高的參與人數。\n\n其他社區參與活動包括為學生和退休人士舉辦講座或網絡研討會。香港金融管理局亦參與了教育局舉辦的關於經濟安全的教師培訓網絡研討會。目前提供八種語言3的網上教育資源，內容提供使用自動櫃員機（ATM）的實用技巧，以滿足香港不同背景人士的需求。\n\n香港金融管理局支持投資者教育委員會在香港推廣金融知識和能力，並將會探索與各利益相關者進一步合作，以最大化社區參與的影響力。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高度透明度，金管局在金融披露方面採用國際標準，只要這些標準適用於中央銀行運作。這些標準包括香港財務報告準則及其他適用報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別數據發布標準。財務部與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，按照香港財務報告準則編製及呈報外匯基金的財務報表。金管局亦在其年度報告中提供詳細披露及對廣泛的支出項目和預算資料進行全面分析。\n\n# 責任與控制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金融管理局最重要職責之一是管理對貨幣及銀行體系的風險。風險管理既涵蓋日常營運層面的工作，也包括透過策略規劃的高層次管理。在香港金融管理局的風險管理框架下，設有兩個高層委員會——宏觀監控委員會及風險委員會，兩者均由香港金融管理局行政總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的職權範圍如下：\n\n識別香港貨幣及金融系統潛在風險和威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可能措施；\n檢視現行管理貨幣及金融系統風險的措施，以識別可能的漏洞，並確保這些措施的充分性；以及\n鼓勵跨部門分享有關宏觀監控的相關資訊，以提升香港金融管理局的宏觀監控能力。\n\n風險委員會的職權範圍如下：\n\n識別對本組織潛在的風險與威脅，並制定策略以降低這些事件的影響；\n檢視現行跨部門風險管理制度，以找出可能的漏洞與重大風險，並確保應對措施的充分性；\n協調風險評估標準與方法，並優先處理已識別風險的資源管理；以及\n鼓勵建立更強的組織性風險管理文化，促進適當的授權與控制。\n\n已建立一套完善的營運風險管理框架，涵蓋組織層面及部門層面的風險。組織層面風險主要指那些在中長期內影響整個組織，或可能需要跨部門應對的風險。各業務單位所識別的潛在及新興風險，以及其制定的控制措施和緩解策略，將每季進行審查和報告。此外，還採用自上而下的方法來管理組織層面風險，由帶領不同業務單位的資深同事主動識別具有更廣泛影響的風險，並提出緩解措施。風險委員會會討論這些評估結果，並決定適當的後續行動。\n"}
{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n","zh":"# 永續性\n\n香港金融管理局現將其首份可持續發展報告作為2021年年報的不可分割部分發佈，旨在闡述其可持續發展策略，記錄自身努力，以及與金融業界攜手合作，支持政府氣候變遷策略，並為建立更具氣候適應力及可持續發展的世界貢獻力量。\n\n香港金融管理局將可持續發展的考慮融入其主要職能和角色之中，無論是作為銀行監管機構、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，還是維持金融及貨幣穩定。此外，香港金融管理局亦與本地及海外同業合作，加強氣候風險的管理和披露，以及發展綠色和可持續金融市場。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局致力履行企業社會責任，並以成為一家負責任且可持續發展的組織為目標。這種承諾體現在多個範疇，包括促進可持續、普惠金融和環保的市場，支持更廣泛的社區，保護環境，以及營造關懷備至的工作場所。\n\n# 概述\n\n氣候變遷是當今世界面臨的最緊迫挑戰之一。為了應對氣候變遷，各國在《巴黎協定》下同意採取行動，以減少溫室氣體排放，並在本世紀內最終實現碳中和。實現《巴黎協定》的氣候變遷目標，預計全球每年將需要投資約 1 至 2 兆美元，這使得永續發展成為未來數十年資本流動的最大驅動力之一。\n\n香港決心走在這次轉型的最前沿。政府宣布將致力在2050年前實現碳中和，與全球發達經濟體步調一致。香港亦是首個承諾於2025年前，在相關行業中，將披露要求與氣候相關財務披露工作小組（TCFD）的建議對齊的亞洲司法管轄區。\n\n對金融界而言，氣候變遷既是風險的來源，也是機遇的所在。雖然金融界無法免受氣候變遷帶來的威脅，但它在推動轉型方面扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金引導至符合低溫室氣體排放途徑及具備氣候韌性的發展活動。\n\n香港金融管理局致力強化香港金融體系，以支持更環保及可持續的未來，推動各項行動支持政府的氣候目標，並為全球議程作出貢獻。為此，金管局在其主要職能和運作中融入可持續發展的考慮因素。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局旨在強化銀行體系抵禦氣候風險的能力，並加速銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的努力。為此，金管局已制定監管框架，列明銀行管理和披露氣候風險的監管要求。於2021年，亦已成功完成氣候風險壓力測試的試點演練，以評估銀行業的韌性。同時，金管局會持續將氣候變化納入金融穩定風險的監測之中。\n\n其次，在市場發展方面，金管局正致力提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心的地位，包括大灣區。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，具備有利條件，可將全球投資引導至中國實現於二零三零年達至碳達峰及二零六零年實現碳中和的規劃。金管局亦透過綠色及可持續金融跨部門 steering group (CASG)³（金管局為聯合主席）加強業界能力，處理數據缺口，並探討發展本地綠色分類框架。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融方案方面處於領先地位，已成立全球首個專門用於發行政府綠色債券的政府中期票據計劃，並自2019年起逐步增加其發行貨幣和期限的多樣性。為支持私營部門發行綠色及可持續債券和貸款，政府於2021年5月設立綠色及可持續融資資助計劃。此計劃由香港金融管理局管理，鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，並鼓勵更多綠色顧問和外部審閱機構在此建立或擴展業務。\n\n第三，作為外匯基金的經理，金管局已確保環境、社會和管治（ESG）因素在其投資流程和資產配置決策中扮演不可或缺的角色。在本報告的後一部分，金管局將首次披露外匯基金投資組合的氣候情景分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四，香港金融管理局正加強自身的綠色辦公室措施，以確保其營運符合應對氣候風險的最佳實踐。作為初步，金管局已評估並確立其第一類和第二類溫室氣體排放範圍的碳足跡，並作出相應披露。與此同時，金管局已實施措施以提升行業整體營運效率，並盡量減少資源消耗。此外，金管局致力履行高標準的企業社會責任，並與其利益相關者合作，促進金融普及及提升金融素養。\n\n將金融體系轉型為綠色金融需要中央銀行和監管機構緊密合作。金管局積極參與國際社群，在全球政策制定和可持續發展標準的協調方面發揮作用。金管局亦已發表聲明支持中央銀行和監管機構綠色金融體系網絡（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言⁵，重申致力落實 NGFS 的建議，並採取必要措施促進綠色金融體系的發展。\n\n為推動這些可持續發展倡議，並評估與氣候相關的機遇和風險，可持續發展和綠色考量已融入香港金融管理局的管治和風險管理框架，而領導層積極參與設定整體目標和指導原則，並諮詢於外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及其轄下委員會。香港金融管理局的企業社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦會評估可持續發展和氣候相關議題對機構的潛在影響，並制定策略以減輕這些影響。相關策略和倡議的執行情況會受到密切監察，並定期向高級管理層匯報。此外，香港金融管理局已聘請外部顧問，就特定工作範疇提供意見。\n\n本章後續章節將深入探討香港金融管理局在履行其各項職能時，在綠色金融和可持續發展方面採取的管治、策略及風險管理措施。\n\n本報告乃參考二零二一年十二月發布的網絡綠色金融工作小組（NGFS）《中央銀行氣候相關披露指南》中建議的披露要素編製而成。此外，有關金管局辦公室營運的資訊，廣泛參照全球報告倡議組織（GRI）標準⁶及香港交易所有限公司頒布的《環境、社會及管治報告指引》。\n\n# 中央銀行與監管機構綠色金融體系網絡\n\n網路零碳金融工作小組（NGFS）為各國中央銀行和審慎監管機構提供了一個交流經驗、分享最佳實務、促進金融業環境及氣候風險管理發展，並動員主流金融以支持轉型至永續經濟的平台。 其宗旨是界定並推廣成員內部及外部應實施的最佳實務，並進行或委託有關綠色金融的分析研究。\n\n# 氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組\n\n二零一五年十二月，金融穩定理事會成立了氣候相關財務披露工作組（TCFD），旨在為企業向投資者、貸款人及保險承保人制定更有效的氣候相關資訊披露建議，藉此促進更明智的決策。 TCFD的建議以四個主題領域為架構，這些領域代表了組織運營的核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理，以及指標與目標。\n\n# 銀行監察員\n\n作為金融體系的核心部分，銀行應積極管理氣候風險，並支持將更多資本引導至綠色和可持續活動。作為銀行監管機構，金管局著重提升銀行抵禦氣候風險的能力，並加速銀行支持轉型至低碳經濟的努力。\n\n# 香港金融管理局的三階段策略總覽\n\n自二零一九年五月起，香港金融管理局已分三個階段推廣綠色及可持續銀行業：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n制定評估個別銀行「綠色基準線」的通用框架，並與國際組織合作，向香港的銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二階段\n\n諮詢業界及其他利害關係者，以了解綠色及永續銀行業的監管期望與要求。\n\n# 第三期\n\n專注於落實監管要求，並監控和評估銀行在綠色及永續銀行業務方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 氣候風險管理的監管要求\n\n於2020年，金管局與業界合作，共同制定評估個別銀行「綠色基線」的通用框架。金管局亦完成了首輪銀行綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行為新的監管要求作準備，金管局於2020年6月發表一份白皮書，闡述其對氣候風險管理的初步監管期望。\n\n於二零二一年十二月，香港金融管理局在聽取業界意見後，發佈了銀行將氣候考慮因素融入企業管治、策略、風險管理和披露的監管要求。具體而言，在二零二五年之前，明確規定銀行必須根據金融穩定理事會（FSB）的氣候相關財務信息披露工作組（TCFD）的建議，強制性披露相關信息，並訂定了具體要求和時間表。這些要求將為銀行提升風險管理能力設定基準。\n\n下一個步驟是香港金融管理局監察銀行執行相關規定。為此，香港金融管理局已加強其監管能力，在其銀行監理部內設立一個新的專責團隊，以執行氣候風險監理工作。\n\n這個分三階段的方法是一個迭代且不斷發展的過程。繼2020年進行的首輪綠色金融評估後，香港金融管理局正在檢視該框架，以納入有關氣候風險管理的最新監管要求，並可能擴大範圍，例如涵蓋其他環境風險以及支持淨零轉型的措施。香港金融管理局計劃於2022年下半年推出更新後的框架。\n\n# 良好實踐以支持邁向碳中和的轉型\n\n除了將氣候風險納入風險管理框架外，部分銀行已投入資源並採取措施支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並為實現全球淨零排放做出貢獻。香港金融管理局於2021年12月發出通函，與業界分享這些銀行的良好做法，供業界其他銀行在制定氣候策略時參考。 這些良好做法歸納為四大範疇：減少銀行自身營運的溫室氣體排放、透過投資組合調整減少融資排放、協助客戶過渡，以及推動集體努力協助經濟實現淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色金融資金流動\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度，並促進綠色金融政策的協調一致，金管局一直與其他金融監管機構合作，探討本地綠色分類框架，以協助各金融行業在國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）8制定的共同基礎分類法（CGT）與中國及歐盟採用的綠色定義之間穿梭應用。這項工作將以互通性、可比較性和包容性原則為指導，同時考慮其他綠色定義、過渡活動以及本地情況。此舉將降低漂綠風險，提升產品可比較性，並最終加強投資者保護。\n\n# 評估：氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化帶來的潛在衝擊的能力，香港金融管理局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試點演練，共有20間主要零售銀行及七家國際銀行分行參與。一份匯總試點CRST演練結果的報告於2021年12月發布。結果顯示，即使面對極端的氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍保持韌性，但這些衝擊可能對銀行財務狀況造成重大不利影響。CRST演練有助於提升銀行衡量和評估氣候風險的能力。根據CRST結果，參與銀行已制定計劃以加強其氣候策略和風險管治框架。香港金融管理局將繼續與業界合作，強化銀行能力並完善CRST框架，並吸取試點演練的經驗教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit\n","zh":"# 匯豐儲備基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署　香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財務司\n\n# 觀點\n\n我謹此證明，我已審核了第217至319頁所載的交換基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）財務報表，包括截至2021年12月31日止的交換基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及其收入及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包括重要的會計政策摘要。\n\n本人認為，截至二零二一年十二月三十一日，該基金及本集團的財務報表真實及公允地反映了該基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港財務報告準則」）編製，且已遵照根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官指示妥善編製。\n\n# 觀點依據\n\n我依照《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官指示及審計署審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則的責任，於我的報告內「審計師就財務報表審計的責任」一段中進一步闡述。我符合該等準則的要求，與本集團保持獨立，並已履行其他專業道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據充分及適當，為我提供發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我對截至2021年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計過程中，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。 這些事項已在整個財務報表審計的背景下加以處理，並在形成我的審計意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 金融資產與金融負債以公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n於二零二一年十二月三十一日，本集團的金融資產總額為港幣四萬五千零二十五億七千五百萬元，金融負債總額為港幣一萬一千五百零八億六千一百萬元，均以公允價值計量。\n\n對於這些金融資產的89%及所有金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價 (第一級輸入)，或使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術估計 (第二級輸入)。\n\n對於其餘11%的這些金融資產，其公允價值是使用估值技術估計，而這些技術的輸入數據並非基於可觀察的市場數據（第三層輸入）。 這些金融資產總額為5,173.16億港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於其金額重大且涉及估計，以公允價值衡量金融資產和金融負債為關鍵審計事項。\n\n對金融資產及金融負債以公允價值衡量之審計程序包括：\n\n瞭解評估不同類別金融資產及金融負債程序（包括相關控制）；\n評估及測試相關控制，包括電腦系統之相關應用控制；\n取得外部函證以確認金融資產及金融負債之估值、存在、權利義務及完整性；\n當使用報價市場價格時，核實價格與獨立來源是否一致；\n當使用以可觀察市場數據為輸入的估值技術時，評估估值方法之適當性及假設之合理性，並將輸入數據與獨立來源核對；以及\n當使用非以可觀察市場數據為輸入的估值技術時，評估估值方法之適當性及假設和輸入數據之合理性。\n\n# 投資物業以公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n本集團的投資物業以其公允價值入賬，於2021年12月31日總額為270.89億港元。本集團亦於一間聯營公司及二十一間合營企業中擁有權益，總額為451.72億港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由本集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營企業持有，均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。 該等估值涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所用假設。\n\n投資物業以公允價值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱本集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公允價值乃基於估值報告中所列的估值；\n評估估值師的獨立性及資格；以及\n評估估值方法之適當性，以及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資料。 這些資料包括香港金融管理局2021年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計報告。\n\n我的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此等資訊表示任何形式的保証結論。\n\n與我審核財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或我在審核過程中所得知的其他資訊存在重大不符，或在其他方面存在重大錯誤陳述。如果根據我所進行的工作，我得出結論認為該等其他資料存在重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。就此，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 香港外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣當局及審核委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，編製真實公允的財務報表，並為此建立內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及採用持續經營為基礎會計處理。\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會審核小組負責監察本集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確定財務報表整體而言是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論該錯誤陳述是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並發出包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並不能保證依照審計署審計準則進行的審計，總能發現當重大錯誤陳述存在時予以偵出。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，如果這些錯誤陳述單獨或彙總起來，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則認為其屬重大。\n\n作為根據審計署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我貫徹專業判斷，並於審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，不論是由於欺詐或錯誤所致，設計及執行對應於這些風險的審計程序，並獲取充足及適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。因欺詐而導致的重大錯誤陳述未被發現的風險，較因錯誤而導致的風險為高，因為欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n了解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計適於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n評估貨幣管理局所使用會計政策的適當性，以及會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n對貨幣管理局使用持續經營會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大不確定性的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我需要於審計報告中引起注意財務報表中的相關披露，或者，如果該等披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計報告日所獲取的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致本集團停止持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體列報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允列報的方式反映其基礎交易和事件；及\n獲取關於本集團內實體或業務活動的充分適當審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的方向、監督和執行。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我會與證券基金諮詢委員會審核小組就審計範圍和時間安排（包括我於審計過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷）以及重大審計發現等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向彼等通報所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及如適用，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事宜，我確定本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，並將其定為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為在報告中溝通該事項會導致負面後果合理預期超過此類溝通的公共利益，否則我會在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n朱約翰 審計署署長\n"}
