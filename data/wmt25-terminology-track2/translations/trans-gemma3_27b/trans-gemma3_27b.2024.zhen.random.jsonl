{"zh":"# 保持警惕，應對風浪\n\n2024年，金管局在錯綜複雜的外部環境中迎難而上。年內，區域性軍事衝突不斷、多國舉行重要的選舉，全球經濟走向欠明朗，令世界局勢持續震盪。然而，各地的決策者在控制通脹飈升和支持經濟發展之間尋求適當平衡，推動主要經濟體實現穩健增長。此外，隨着美國啟動四年來首次減息，加上內地連串支持經濟的政策出台，令市場情緒轉趨樂觀。整體而言，全球宏觀環境仍充滿變數。\n\n面對複雜形勢，我們的應對策略是繼續充分發揮香港離岸人民幣業務、金融科技與綠色和可持續金融的樞紐作用和獨特優勢，持續鞏固香港國際金融中心的領先地位。2024年，金管局在這些重點領域取得顯著進展。年度盛事「國際金融領袖投資峰會」等多項活動和計劃反應熱烈，充分展現出國際社會對香港國際金融中心發展前景的堅定信心。\n\n面對香港經濟的周期性調整和結構性轉型，我們與銀行界緊密合作，加強對中小型企業（中小企）的支援，紓緩企業在高息環境下的還款負擔，同時助力它們持續發展。加上中央和香港特區政府推出的多項政策措施，香港經濟得以穩步復甦。2024年，本港經濟錄得2.5%的溫和增長。\n\n踏入2025年，全球經濟在更趨複雜的地緣政治形勢下繼續面臨諸多不確定性。貿易保護主義升温和關稅壁壘增加，將導致全球供應鏈受阻，地緣經濟割裂加劇，為全球經濟前景增添更多變數。倘若地緣政治緊張局勢進一步升溫，將可能對實體經濟和環球金融市場造成雙重衝擊。\n\n面對複雜嚴峻的經濟和金融環境，金管局將保持警惕，切實履行我們的職責，竭力維護香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定，並持續鞏固香港國際金融中心地位。我們將深化與市場各界的聯繫，積極推動新興領域的發展，確保香港在全球金融格局中保持領先優勢。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度：穩健基石\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）實施40多年來，一直是香港貨幣與金融穩定的基石，成功抵禦了多個經濟和利率周期的挑戰，展現出強大的抗震力。\n\n儘管2024年美國利率政策充滿不確定性，但港元貨幣市場繼續按照聯匯制度的機制暢順運行。年內港元滙率在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的兌換範圍內上落，在年初首四個月因流動性回軟而稍為走弱，其後逐步轉強，至年底時接近強方兌換保證水平。穩定的匯率充分反映了市場對聯匯制度的信心。同時聯匯制度亦持續獲得國際貨幣基金組織及國際金融界的高度認可。\n\n市場對聯匯制度的信心，建基於我們持續主動向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的運作機制和優點，以及嚴密的市場監察工作。通過收集詳細數據，結合先進的數據分析和人工智能技術，我們對市場進行更及時、更全面的監察和金融穩定性評估。\n\n# 銀行體系：多重挑戰下保持穩健\n\n2024年，香港銀行體系在多重宏觀挑戰下展現出強大的韌性，資本和流動性保持充裕。2024年底，本地銀行綜合總資本比率達21.8%，高於8%的國際最低要求。流動性方面亦同樣充裕，第4季度大型銀行流動性覆蓋比率達178.4%，高於100%的法定最低門檻。受利率持續高企、部分內地房企債務問題尚未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱等因素影響，特定分類貸款比率於年底上升至1.96%。由於銀行恪守審慎的信用風險管理並維持充足撥備，相關風險總體可控。\n\n在持續密切監察銀行信貸風險包括物業按揭貸款相關風險的同時，金管局針對物業市場狀況及銀行體系相關風險的變化，於2024年對物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施實施了兩輪調整。具體而言，所有住宅物業的最高按揭成數及供款與入息比率上限均回復至2009年實施逆周期宏觀審慎措施前的水平。\n\n在持續強化銀行信貸風險管理的同時，我們亦致力提升銀行的運作與科技穩健性，應對日益依賴第三方服務提供者所帶來的新挑戰。以去年7月的CrowdStrike全球事故為例，該事故凸顯了在當今全球高度連繫的環境下，運作故障可能造成連鎖的嚴重後果。雖然事故對香港銀行業影響有限，但反映出我們必須確保銀行建立穩健架構，即使發生嚴重的情況仍能維持關鍵業務運作。令人鼓舞的是，目前香港所有銀行均建立了運作穩健性架構，並已經進入配對工作及情景測試的重要階段，通過識別和修補脆弱環節，確保關鍵業務的運作。\n\n與此同時，為應對多變的網絡威脅，金管局去年着力加強銀行體系的網絡防衛能力，包括發布新指引、開展專題審查。我們並與本地其他金融監管機構合作推進跨行業「網絡地圖」項目，評估和應對金融機構、金融市場基礎設施及科技服務供應商相互連繫可能引發的系統性網絡風險。在2024年完成試行後，該項目將於今年全面展開。\n\n科技發展帶來的另一個重大挑戰是金融詐騙威脅不斷升級且手法日趨複雜，需要銀行、監管機構、執法機構和公眾聯手應對。我們已經要求銀行進一步加強網上銀行保安措施和監察系統。反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組）去年亦將覆蓋範圍擴大至所有主要零售銀行及六家儲值支付工具持牌機構，顯著提升了情報交換的效率和規模，沒收的犯罪得益亦隨之增加。同時，促進銀行間訊息分享的法例修訂諮詢獲得廣泛支持，該法例將有助進一步提升銀行偵測及防止金融罪案的能力。\n\n除上述措施外，提升公眾對可疑交易的警覺性及自我保護意識亦同樣重要。2024年，我們擴大了「可疑帳號警示」機制的覆蓋範圍，並推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，引入更多參與機構，以擴大約章的保護網，進一步保障公眾。同時，我們亦推出「智安存服務，讓銀行存戶可選擇將部分存款分隔，提供額外保障。\n\n除上述各項協助客戶防範詐騙的措施外，我們亦針對個別客戶可能因衝動而過度借貸，在去年要求零售銀行為無抵押消費信貸產品提供至少七天的冷靜期，讓客戶在訂立貸款協議後能再三仔細考量和評估其財務責任和償還能力。同時，「信資通」個人資料基建項目亦於去年成功推出，在提升個人信貸資料服務方面取得重要進展。\n\n除監管工作外，2024年我們的另一工作重點是確保信貸供應以支持實體經濟，這對作為香港經濟重要支柱的中小企尤為重要。去年，我們與銀行業聯合推出「9+5」支持措施，協助中小企獲取銀行融資應對周轉需要，並助力其升級轉型。銀行已經作出承諾：不會要求按時供款的按揭客戶提前還款，亦不會純粹基於抵押品價值下跌而下調信貸額度。截至目前，已經有超過39,000家中小企獲得信貸支援及新批貸款，涉及信貸額度合共950億港元。銀行亦在貸款組合中預留約3,900億港元專項資金，支持中小企在市場環境變化中持續發展。此外，金管局與香港銀行公會聯合成立「中小企融資專責小組」，從具體個案及行業整體層面為中小企提供支援。鑑於當前貿易爭端及外圍經濟前景不明朗，我們於2025年4月再新增三項針對特定行業的支持措施，進一步加強對多個行業中小企的支持。與此同時，我們還推出了兩項措施以支持香港整體經濟發展。\n\n在維護銀行體系穩定和提升其運作效率方面，我們持續推動銀行業的科技應用，並着力加快銀行業採用金融科技的步伐。目前，香港所有零售銀行均已經將金融科技應用於日常營運。此外，鑑於生成式人工智能(GenAI)在強化銀行業風險管理、防範詐騙和提升客戶體驗方面的潛力，金管局與數碼港去年合作推出「GenAI沙盒」，鼓勵銀行在負責任的前提下應用GenAI。我們同時向銀行發布指引，明確規定銀行若在面向客戶的服務中應用GenAI ，必須確保客戶獲得充分保障。此外，金管局內部亦積極運用GenAI技術，提升分析和監管效率。除GenAI外，我們還通過推出全新FiNETech系列活動、建立配對平台「FintechConnect」，以及舉辦一系列跨行業交流活動，促進金融服務與科技界的連繫，推動金融科技生態圈的合作與創新發展。\n\n# 鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位\n\n儘管2024年充滿挑戰和不確定性，香港仍穩守國際金融中心的領先地位，更在多個領域和國際影響力方面持續拓展提升。\n\n香港作為連接中國內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，扮演着無可比擬的獨特角色。通過推出各項有利措施和加強與各方協作，香港不斷鞏固提升其作為區內金融科技與可持續金融樞紐的地位。有關我們在綠色和可持續金融方面的具體工作，可參閱《二零二四年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 人民幣業務增長迅速，深化與內地金融合作\n\n2024年，香港人民幣業務持續保持良好勢頭，在貿易結算支付、離岸債券發行，尤其是離岸銀行貸款方面均錄得顯著增長。人民幣即時支付結算系統創下日均交易額的歷史新高，達3.1萬億元人民幣，反映香港全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的作用更為突出。\n\n與此同時，我們持續深化香港與內地的金融互聯互通。2024年推出的「三聯通、三便利」政策，加上今年初公布的六項新措施，均取得重大政策突破。其中，金管局推出1,000億元人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，為銀行提供穩定且具成本效益的資金來源，以擴展人民幣貿易融資服務，從而支持實體經濟發展。另一項政策突破是允許投資者使用債券通「北向通」持有的在岸債券，特別是國家財政部和政策性銀行發行的在岸債券，作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排、香港場外結算公司及離岸人民幣債券回購業務的合資格抵押品。這一創新舉措提升了在岸債券對離岸投資者的吸引力，有助於促進全球投資者更大程度地參與在岸債券市場。我們去年亦推出「跨境理財通2.0」，實現了多方面的升級優化，包括提供更多元化的投資產品、更靈活的銷售與推廣安排，並擴大個人投資額度。這些措施不僅鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，也進一步強化了我們作為連接內地與國際市場的重要門戶角色。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority rose to the challenge amid a complex external environment. Throughout the year, regional military conflicts continued, and many countries held important elections, while the global economic outlook remained unclear, causing continued volatility in the situation (trade tensions). However, policymakers around the world sought an appropriate balance between controlling rising inflation and supporting economic development, driving robust growth in major economies. Furthermore, with the US launching its first interest rate cut in four years, together with a series of economic support policies implemented in Mainland, market sentiment turned optimistic. Overall, the global macroeconomic environment remains challenging.\n\nFaced with a complex situation, our strategy is to continue to fully unlock Hong Kong’s role as an offshore renminbi business hub, as well as the unique advantages of fintech and green and sustainable finance, to continuously consolidate Hong Kong’s leading position as an International Financial Centre. In 2024, the HKMA made significant progress in these key areas. A number of activities and the Annual International Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit generated strong responses, fully demonstrating the international community’s unwavering confidence in the prospects for Hong Kong’s Financial Centre development.\n\nFacing the cyclical adjustment and structural transformation of Hong Kong’s economy, we have been working closely with the banking sector to support SMEs, alleviate the repayment burden on enterprises in an environment of high interest rates, and at the same time drive their continued development. Together with a number of policy measures launched by the Central and Hong Kong SAR Government, Hong Kong’s economy has achieved a stable recovery. In 2024, Hong Kong’s economy recorded 2.5% moderate growth.\n\nStepping further into 2025, the global economy continues to face many uncertainties under a more complex geopolitical situation. The increase in trade protection and tariff barriers will lead to disruptions in global supply chains, exacerbate geopolitical economic fragmentation, and add more variables to the prospects for the global economy. Should geopolitical tensions heat up further, it could deliver a double blow to the real economy and global financial markets.\n\nFaced with a complex and challenging economic and financial environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant and earnestly fulfill our responsibilities, striving to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and banking sector, and to continue to consolidate Hong Kong’s financial centre status. We will deepen our linkages with market participants, actively promote the development of emerging areas, and ensure that Hong Kong maintains a leading edge in the global financial landscape.\n\n# Linked exchange rate system: resilient cornerstone\n\nLinked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been implemented for over the years, and has consistently been a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, successfully withstanding various economic and interest rate cycle challenges, demonstrating strong resilience.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding US interest rate policies in 2024, the Hong Kong dollar currency market continued to operate smoothly according to the linked exchange rate system’s mechanism. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, softening slightly in the first four months of the year due to moderating liquidity, before gradually strengthened, approaching the strong-side exchange rate guarantee level at the end of the year. The stable exchange rate reflects market confidence in the linked exchange rate system. At the same time, the linked exchange rate system continues to receive a high degree of authorization from the International Monetary Fund and the international financial community.\n\nConfidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System in the Market is built on our continued proactive explanation to the Public of the operational mechanisms and advantages of the Linked Exchange Rate System, as well as rigorous market monitoring work. By collecting detailed data, combined with advanced data analysis and Artificial Intelligence technologies, we conduct more timely and comprehensive monitoring of the Market and financial stability assessment.\n\n# The banking sector: remaining resilient in the face of multiple challenges.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong banking sector demonstrated strong resilience under multiple macro challenges, with capital and liquidity remaining robust. At the end of 2024, the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of local banks reached 21.8%, higher than the international minimum requirement of 8%. Liquidity was also sufficiently robust, with the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks reaching 178.4% in the fourth quarter, above the statutory minimum threshold of 100%. Affected by persistently high policy rates, unresolved debt issues of some Mainland real estate enterprises, and the soft local commercial real estate market, the ratio of classified loans rose to 1.96% at the end of the year. Due to banks’ prudent credit risk management and maintaining sufficient allocated provisions, related risks are generally manageable.\n\nWhile continuously monitoring bank credit risks including risks related to residential property mortgage lending, the HKMA, in response to changing property market conditions and risks related to the banking sector, implemented two rounds of adjustments to the countercyclical macroprudential regulation of residential property mortgage loans in 2024. Specifically, the maximum loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio for all residential properties have returned to the levels before the implementation of countercyclical macroprudential measures in 2009.\n\nWhile continuously reinforcing banking credit risk management, we also strive to enhance the resilience of banking operations and technology to address the new challenges brought about by increasing reliance on third-party service providers. Taking the CrowdStrike global incident in July of last year as an example, the incident highlighted that operational failures can cause a chain of serious consequences in today’s highly interconnected global environment. Although the incident had a limited impact on the Hong Kong banking sector, it reflects the need for us to ensure that banks have developed robust frameworks that can maintain critical business operations even when severe incidents occur. Encouragingly, all banks in Hong Kong have now developed operational resilience frameworks and have already entered an important phase of mapping and scenario testing, ensuring the operation of critical businesses by identifying and addressing vulnerable sessions.\n\nAt the same time, to respond to evolving cyber threats, the HKMA focused last year on strengthening the resilience of the banking sector’s cyber defences, including publishing new guidelines and conducting thematic reviews. We and collaborate with other local financial regulatory agencies to advance the cross-sectoral “Cyber Mapping” project, to assess and deal with systemic cyber risks that may arise from the interconnectedness of financial institutions, financial market infrastructure and technology service providers. Following completion of the pilot run in 2024, the project will be fully launched this year.\n\nAnother significant challenge brought about by technological development is the constantly upgrading threats of financial scams and their increasingly complex methods, requiring banks, regulatory agencies, law enforcement, and the public to work together to combat them. We have already asked banks to further enhance their online banking security measures and monitoring systems. The Anti-Money Laundering and fraud intelligence working group (the intelligence working group) also expanded its coverage last year to include all major retail banks and six licensed Stored Value Facility operators, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scale of intelligence sharing, with confiscated proceeds also increasing as a result. At the same time, the consultation on legislative changes to promote information sharing between banks received widespread support, and this legislation will help further enhance banks’ ability to detect and prevent financial crimes.\n\nIn addition to the above measures, enhancing public alertness to suspicious transactions and self-protection awareness is also equally important. In 2024, we expanded the coverage of the “Alert for Suspicious Account” mechanism and launched the “Consumer Protection Charter 2.0,” introducing more participating institutions to broaden the Charter’s protection network and further protect the public. At the same time, we also launched “Smart Deposit services, allowing bank depositors to choose to segregate a portion of their deposits, providing additional protection.\n\nIn addition to the various measures to assist customers in preventing scams, we also required retail banks last year to provide at least a seven-day cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products, to allow customers to carefully assess and evaluate their financial responsibility and repayment ability after entering into a loan agreement. Meanwhile, the “Credit Information Share” infrastructure project was also successfully launched last year, achieving significant progress in enhancing personal credit data services.\n\nIn addition to our supervisory work, another key work priority for 2024 is to ensure credit supply to support the real economy, which is particularly important for SMEs as a pillar of the Hong Kong economy. Last year, we jointly launched the “9+5” support initiatives with the banking sector to assist SMEs in obtaining bank financing to meet their working capital needs and to help with their upgrade and transformation. Banks have committed not to require mortgage customers who are making timely repayments to make early repayments, nor will they lower credit limits solely based on a decline in collateral value. As of now, more than 39,000 SMEs have received credit support and new loan approvals, involving a total credit amount of HK$95 billion. Banks have also reserved approximately HK$390 billion in dedicated funds within their loan portfolios to support SMEs’ continued development in a changing market environment. Furthermore, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks jointly established a Taskforce on SME Financing to provide support to SMEs from both individual cases and an industry-wide level. Given the current trade disputes and uncertain external economic prospects, we added three sector-specific support initiatives in April 2025 to further strengthen support for SMEs in various industries. At the same time, we have also launched two initiatives to support the overall economic development of Hong Kong.\n\nIn maintaining the stability of the banking sector and enhancing its operational efficiency, we continue to promote the applications of technology in the banking sector and are committed to accelerating the adoption of financial technology by banks. Currently, all retail banks in Hong Kong have already applied financial technology to their day-to-day operations. Furthermore, given the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening banking sector risk management, preventing scams and fraud, and enhancing customer experience, the HKMA collaborated with Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation last year to launch the “GenAI Sandbox,” encouraging banks to apply GenAI responsibly. We have also issued guidance to banks, clearly requiring that if they apply GenAI in customer-facing services, they must ensure adequate protection for customers. In addition, the HKMA is also actively using GenAI technology internally to enhance analysis and supervisory efficiency. Besides GenAI, we are also promoting engagement between the financial services and technology sectors through the launch of the new FiNETech series of events, the establishment of the matchmaking platform “FintechConnect,” and the organisation of a range of cross-sectoral exchange activities, to foster collaboration and innovative development within the financial technology ecosystem.\n\n# Consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre.\n\nDespite the challenging 2024 and uncertainties, Hong Kong remains a leading international financial centre, and continues to expand and enhance its position in various areas and its international influence.\n\nHong Kong plays a unique role as an indispensable bridge connecting Mainland China and international markets. By launched various favorable measures and strengthening cooperation with all parties, Hong Kong continuously consolidates and enhance its position as a regional hub for fintech and sustainable finance. For details on our work in green and sustainable finance, see the “2024 Sustainable Development Report.”\n\n# RMB business grew rapidly, deepening cooperation with Mainland financial entities.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s renminbi business continued to maintain robust growth momentum in trade settlement payments, offshore bond issuance, and particularly offshore bank lending. The Real-Time Gross Settlement system for renminbi payments recorded a new high in daily transaction volume, reaching 3.1 billion renminbi, reflecting the increasingly prominent role of Hong Kong as a hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to deepen financial connectivity between Hong Kong and the Mainland. The “Three Connect, Three Facilitate” policies launched in 2024, together with the six new initiatives announced earlier this year, have all achieved significant policy breakthroughs. Among these, the HKMA launched a RMB 100 billion trade finance liquidity facility to provide banks with a stable and cost-effective source of funds to expand trade finance services in RMB, thereby supporting the development of the real economy. Another policy breakthrough is allowing investors to use onshore bonds held through the Northbound Bond Connect as eligible collateral for the HKMA’s RMB liquidity facility, Hong Kong’s offshore clearing houses, and offshore RMB bond repurchase business, particularly onshore bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and policy banks. This innovative move enhances the attractiveness of onshore bonds to offshore investors and helps promote greater participation by global investors in the onshore bond market. We also launched “Wealth Management Connect 2.0” last year, which realized multifaceted upgrades and enhancements, including providing a more diversified range of investment products, more flexible sales and promotion arrangements, and expanding individual investment quotas. These measures not only consolidate Hong Kong’s status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business but also further strengthen our role as an important gateway connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n"}
{"zh":"# 2024 年摘要\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施， 加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n香港銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動性均十分充裕，整體資產質素維持可控。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢存在不明朗因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首4個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 銀行體系穩定\n\n金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括「生成式人工智能沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》、「智安存」，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期，以加強銀行消費者保障。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦發出數碼資產相關活動指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點及放寬多項對數字銀行的限制，並完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過加強公私營夥伴合作平台的情報交換和合作，可疑交易報告的數量顯著增加，因而能更有效沒收犯罪得益。有關促進銀行分享訊息的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持，並將進一步協助偵測及防止金融罪行。此外，金管局就應用人工智能監察可疑活動以及防範及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引，並優化「可疑帳號警示」機制。\n\n金管局在香港實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。此外，香港存款保障計劃的多個範疇均作出優化，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n金管局繼續推進確保處置機制具公信力的工作，實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的失序地提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」交易的合資格抵押品範圍；以及優化「北向互換通」。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。此外，金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。另一方面，金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好，主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，主要央行亦隨着通脹逐步放緩而陸續下調政策利率。在此背景下，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n金管局繼續致力推動資產多元化及負責任投資。與此同時，長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n# 機構職能\n\n金管局透過不同渠道與社會及市場保持密切聯繫，提升公眾對金管局政策及工作的了解。\n\n對內方面，金管局致力建立一支靈活應變及專業的工作團隊，同時遵守嚴格的財政紀律及提升數碼能力，應對變化及確保有效執行各項政策及措施。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

environment\n\nHong Kong’s economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, mainly driven by a rebound in merchandise exports as external demand improved and the global technology cycle recovered. The labor market remained resilient, and inflation stayed moderate as external price pressures further eased. The Hong Kong stock market rebounded significantly, while the property market remained largely soft due to market sentiment being pressured by continued high interest rates. Given the escalating international trade tensions, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, mainland China’s proactive launch of economic stimulus measures, together with the multifaceted support provided to local enterprises, are expected to consolidate business confidence. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen international collaboration and deepen regional cooperation.\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector remains resilient, with capital and liquidity both robust, and the overall asset quality remains manageable.\n\n# Currency stability\n\nDespite uncertainties surrounding the direction of the US monetary policy, global growth prospects and geopolitical tensions, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and monetary market continued to operate smoothly and efficiently. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened in the first four months of 2024, and then strengthened for the rest of the year. As a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience in withstanding external shocks.\n\n# Banking sector stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly launched measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, and through risk-based regulation and contingency planning provided protection for the stability of the banking sector. It also provides regulatory guidance and support to the industry to respond to new risks, in order to enhance the soundness of operations and cyber resilience of the banking sector. To encourage the application of financial technology, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a series of cross-sectoral projects, including the “Generative Artificial Intelligence Sandbox”.\n\nThe HKMA launched the “Protection of Consumers Charter 2.0” against scams, “Smart Deposit”, and a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to enhance consumer protection for banking customers. In addition, the HKMA provides guidance to banks on applying Generative Artificial Intelligence in customer-facing services, and is working closely with the industry to provide one more Payment arrangement for secondary property transactions. The HKMA also issued guidelines related to Digital asset activities, enhanced the Pilot Scheme for Wealth Management Connect business, relaxed a number of restrictions on Digital banks, and completed the full transition of personal consumer credit reference services to “CreditGo”.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays an important role in Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. Through enhanced intelligence sharing and co-operation via public-private partnership platforms, the volume of suspicious transaction reports has increased significantly, thereby enabling more effective confiscation of proceeds of crime. Consultation on legislative changes to promote banks sharing information received widespread Support, and increases further assistance in detecting and preventing financial crime. Furthermore, the HKMA issues guidance to banks on applying Artificial Intelligence to monitor suspicious activity and prevent and disrupt authorised Payment scams and fraud, and enhances the “suspicious Account alerts” mechanism.\n\nThe HKMA has made good progress in implementing International regulatory standards, including capital adequacy and disclosure. In addition, various areas of the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Scheme have been enhanced to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nThe HKMA continues to push forward with work to enhance the credibility of the resolution mechanism, implement resolution standards, require banks to update financial contracts with counterparties, and reduce the risk of disorderly early termination during resolution. In addition, the HKMA has made significant progress in determining banks’ preferred resolution strategies, dealing with barriers to resolvability, and enhancing the capacity for resolution execution.\n\n# Hong Kong’s international financial centre status\n\nThe HKMA, together with related authorities in the Mainland and Hong Kong, has launched a range of measures to jointly deepen and expand connectivity between Hong Kong and the Mainland’s Financial markets, including enhancements to “Wealth Management Connect”; expanding the scope of eligible collateral for the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity and Northbound Bond Connect transactions; and optimising “Northbound Bond Connect”. These measures help reinforce Hong Kong’s gateway role and underpin its status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s financial centre’s competitiveness, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has strengthened its market outreach to overseas and the Mainland stakeholders, ensuring they have a full understanding of the soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third ‘Investment Summit’ and various other major events were successfully held, not only helping to enhance Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre, but also creating a positive ripple effect. In addition, the HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulatory organisations, continuing to contribute to the global work of maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market development.\n\nThe HKMA has made significant progress in all areas of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure. On the other hand, the HKMA is currently working closely with the People’s Bank of China to promote the implementation of the linkage between the Hong Kong “Faster Payment System” and the Mainland’s cross-border bank-to-bank clearing system for online payments, achieving cross-border Payment.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nIn 2024, global Financial markets performed generally well, with major economies recording stable growth, and major central banks also gradually lowered policy rates as inflation softened. Against this Background, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with a rate of return of 5.2%.\n\nThe HKMA continues its efforts to promote asset diversification and responsible investment. Meanwhile, the long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains close linkages with the public and markets through various channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and work.\n\nInternally, the HKMA strives to establish a agile contingency and professional workforce, while maintaining strict financial discipline and enhancing digital capabilities, to respond to changing circumstances and ensure effective execution of various policies and measures.\n"}

{"zh":"# 2025 年工作重點及前瞻\n\n2025年環球經濟前景仍然不明朗，美國的經濟與貿易政策存在顯著的不確定性，加上美國通脹面對上行風險，以致市場憂慮美國政策利率的未來走向。與此同時，在中國內地公布及陸續推出經濟刺激措施後，內地與香港的市場氣氛改善，而政府推出的各項相關支持措施應可令訪港旅遊業進一步改善。香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局將繼續致力促進香港金融體系及基建的穩定與健全。面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，我們會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，我們會積極把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港的國際金融中心地位。我們會繼續謹慎而靈活地管理外匯基金。我們會作出適當的防禦性部署，並維持高流動性，亦會持續多元化投資，致力提高外匯基金的長期投資回報，確保外匯基金能繼續有效維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 金融體系穩定健全\n\n在新一屆美國政府下，政策走向難以預料，並引致地緣經濟碎片化，因此預期全球經濟不明朗的情況應會在2025年持續。金管局肩負促進香港金融體系穩定健全的重任，將繼續提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，確保能掌握最新發展，並作好準備隨時為香港經濟提供支援。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n展望2025年，鑑於宏觀經濟環境不明朗，環球金融市場或會出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與不穩定因素，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。我們亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，並評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n宏觀經濟環境的不確定性很可能會對銀行體系帶來挑戰。與此同時，數碼化的持續發展及生成式人工智能(GenAI)等創新科技的應用，既帶來眾多好處，亦不免為銀行增添新的業務操作與科技風險。面對上述環境，金管局將致力於透過提供政策與實務指引，以及與個別銀行以至整體業界的持續監管聯繫與溝通，進一步加強銀行抵禦不同衝擊的能力。同時，我們亦會因應科技發展、客戶預期的變化，以及國際標準與最佳做法，繼續加強及改進銀行規管架構與監管模式。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在信貸環境面臨壓力下，金管局將繼續重點監察認可機構的資產質素，並評估它們的信用風險管理手法的成效，特別是涉及貸款分類與撥備，以及問題貸款管理等範疇。同時，我們會與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，並鼓勵認可機構在維持審慎信用風險管理的首要原則下，繼續支持實體經濟。\n\n主要先進經濟體利率前景不明朗及地緣政治緊張局勢升溫，致使環球金融市場更趨波動，有見及此，金管局會繼續採取主動，監管認可機構的市場風險管理。因應宏觀經濟環境不明朗，以及銀行服務日益數碼化，我們亦會審視認可機構如何管理流動性風險，以加強它們應付突發性資金流的能力。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n金管局會繼續其提升銀行體系整體運作穩健性的工作，審視銀行在識別維持關鍵運作的潛在風險並作出補救方面的進度，以作為其實施運作穩健性架構的其中一部分。\n\n鑑於銀行業日益倚賴第三方服務供應商，金管局會進一步加強銀行對第三方風險的管理，制定新指引以實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）所制定的相關國際標準。\n\n在網絡防衛韌性方面，金管局會透過跨界別的「網絡地圖」項目評估系統性網絡風險。該項目正由金管局聯同其他本地金融監管機構按照國際貨幣基金組織的建議共同推進。此外，我們將審視銀行實施「穩固三重數據備份」安排的情況及推出網絡防衛韌性測試框架，以推動銀行加強在遇到嚴峻網絡事故時恢復關鍵運作的能力。\n\n儘管我們留意到銀行業更廣泛採用GenAI等高端技術所帶來的好處，但亦會保持警覺，留意新生風險，並按需要就相關技術的運用提供指引。\n\n我們亦會與業界及其他相關持份者合作，保持機動應對，防患未然，以提升銀行打擊數碼詐騙及防範千變萬化的詐騙手法的能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2025年，金管局將推出制度改革、創新及其他措施，以提升香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈的整體能力、減低來自非法資金流的威脅，以及與最新的國際標準及最佳做法看齊。\n\n作為政府跨部門合作的一部分，我們將協助進行第三次香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的全面評估，以加深對科技發展所帶來的潛在弱點的了解，並根據評估結果制定有效且適度的指引，以配合新的穩定幣發行人監管制度的實施。\n\n我們將會繼續在能帶來公眾價值的領域帶領及推廣負責任地應用科技，包括人工智能。相關工作包括加強可疑活動監察，讓銀行能識別及制止更多詐騙及傀儡戶口，從而進一步增加向執法機構提交的優質及有助作出跟進的情報。\n\n為加強打擊詐騙和其他金融罪行的力度，我們將提出所需的法例修訂建議，為銀行間分享個人戶口的訊息創造必要的途徑與保障。為加強偵測非法資金流的速度與數量，金管局將展開有關支付數據分析平台的工作。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n在2025年，金管局會就認可機構在證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務方面的操守進行現場及非現場審查。我們會重點留意高收益複雜產品、數碼資產及相關投資產品、「跨境理財通」業務、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、長期保險產品及保費融資業務，並會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，按需要就銷售證券、投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準提供指引。為促進數碼資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，我們會繼續與政府及其他監管機構合作，確保為數碼資產行業制定穩健、周全和平衡的監管架構。\n\n此外，金管局會促進及監察業界實施「跨境理財通」優化措施的情況，並繼續與業界及相關監管當局聯繫，以進一步優化該計劃及其他銀行相關的跨境項目。\n\n我們亦會按需要整合及釐清有關財富管理及強積金相關業務的現行指引，讓業界更容易掌握金管局的監管規定，便利遵守。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案於2025年1月1日在香港生效。金管局將就最終改革方案在詮釋方面的常見問題持續向認可機構提供指引並加以釐清，以確保業界一致地採納該方案。\n\n巴塞爾委員會在2022年12月發出銀行審慎處理加密資產風險承擔的新標準，再於2024年7月發出具針對性修訂，進一步釐清穩定幣得到優惠監管待遇的準則。同時，巴塞爾委員會亦發表題為「加密資產風險承擔的披露」的文件，列載更新的加密資產風險承擔披露規定。為於香港實施相關標準，金管局會研究可能需要對《銀行業（資本）規則》、《銀行業（披露）規則》、《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》（《風險承擔限度規則》）及《銀行業（流動性）規則》等各套規則作出的法例修訂。金管局亦會因應實施經驗及業界回饋，對《風險承擔限度規則》提出若干優化建議。金管局將於2025年上半年就修訂進行法定諮詢，以能按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2026年1月1日實施新標準。金管局亦會制定相關銀行業申報表及輔助指引，以便利認可機構實施新標準。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為緊貼最新國際標準、監管方法及銀行業的發展，金管局計劃更新多個《監管政策手冊》單元，包括CA-G-5「監管審查程序」、CA-B-2「具系統重要性銀行」、IC-5「壓力測試」、IR-1「銀行帳內的利率風險」及IC-3「認可機構外聘核數師根據《銀行業條例》提交報告書的規定」。《監管政策手冊》單元CR-G-13「對手方信用風險管理」會作出修訂，以反映巴塞爾委員會在2024年12月發出的「對手方信用風險管理指引」提出的穩健做法。\n\n# 巴塞爾委員會的有效監管銀行業的主要原則\n\n巴塞爾委員會於2024年4月發出經修訂的《有效監管銀行業的主要原則》（《主要原則》）。經修訂《主要原則》反映自對上一次在2012年進行修訂以來監管與規管方面的發展，以及最近的結構性趨勢對銀行與銀行體系的影響。金管局將於2025年進行詳盡的自我評估，以確保其監管及規管架構符合經修訂《主要原則》。\n\n# 會計準則\n\n國際會計準則理事會計劃在2025年就動態風險管理(Dynamic Risk Management)發出徵求意見稿。金管局將與其他有關當局合作，就建議的動態風險管理會計模型對現行審慎監管規定的影響作出研究。\n\n# 執法\n\n金管局在2024年就擴大金融管理專員的調查及執法權力的建議諮詢銀行業，以確保他仍具備必要權力有效履行在《銀行業條例》下的職能。經考慮在諮詢中收到的意見後，金管局將調整有關建議，並制定必要的法例修訂，以進一步諮詢各持份者。\n\n# 處置機制\n\n金管局正繼續推行為期多年的項目，以建立運作暢順的認可機構處置機制。在2025年，金管局優先進行以下範疇的工作（表1）：\n\n表1 2025年處置機制的工作重點\n\n# 處置政策及標準\n\n- 就有關金管局對處置中的估值採取的方法，以及認可機構為支持適時穩健的處置估值而須具備的事前能力及安排的《實務守則》篇章進行諮詢，並完成相關制定工作\n- 推進制定處置重組的政策標準的工作\n\n# 國際及跨境合作\n\n- 參與國際處置政策發展及有效實施方面的工作，尤其金融穩定理事會透過轄下的處置機制督導小組及各工作小組計劃於2025年進行的12項處置機制改革措施\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

economic prospects remain uncertain in 2025, with significant uncertainty surrounding the US’s economic and trade policies, together with upward risk to US inflation, leading to market concerns about the future direction of US policy rates. At the same time, following the announcement and successive launches of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China, market sentiment in the Mainland and Hong Kong has improved, and the various related support measures launched by the Government should be able to further improve the Hong Kong tourism industry. Hong Kong’s financial system, backed by the resilient shock resistance capabilities and robust buffers developed over the years, has adequate ability to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to strive to promote the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system(s) and infrastructure. Facing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we will remain vigilant, seeking to quickly identify emerging risks and respond to them with agility. At the same time, we will actively capture opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong’s international financial centre status. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund prudently and with agility. We will implement appropriate defensive deployments and maintain high liquidity, and will also continue to diversify investments, striving to enhance the long-term investment return of the Exchange Fund, ensuring it can continue to effectively maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Financial system stability and integrity\n\nUnder the new US Government, policy direction is difficult to predict and leads to geo-economic fragmentation; therefore, the expectation is that the global economic situation will remain unclear and continue into 2025. The HKMA bears the important responsibility of promoting the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system(s), will continue to enhance vigilance, prevent various potential risks, ensure it can grasp the latest developments, and prepare to provide support for the Hong Kong economy at any time.\n\n# Be vigilant about potential risks.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, global financial markets may experience volatility. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, thanks to the resilience and buffers developed over the years, has adequate ability to withstand adverse shocks. The HKMA also has the capabilities, resources and determination to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor the risks and instability factors in the local and external environment, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system(s). We will also study issues that affect the Hong Kong economy, and assess potential risks related to these matters.\n\n# Maintain banking sector stability.\n\nThe uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment will likely bring challenges to the banking sector. At the same time, the continued development of digitalization and the application of innovative technologies such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) bring numerous benefits, but also introduce new business operations and technology risks for banks. Facing the above environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will strive to further strengthen the resilience of banks to various shocks by providing policy and practical guidance, as well as continued supervisory engagement and communications with individual banks and the industry as a whole. Simultaneously, we will, following technological developments, changing customer expectations, and international standards and best practices, continue to enhance and improve the banking regulatory framework and supervisory model.\n\n# Risk-based regulatory priority.\n\n# Credit, liquidity, and market risks\n\nUnder pressure in the credit environment, the HKMA will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess the effectiveness of their credit risk management approaches, particularly in areas involving loan classification and provisioning, as well as management of problem loans etc. At the same time, we will maintain close communications with the banking sector and business community, and encourage authorized institutions to continue supporting the real economy under the primary principle of maintaining prudent credit risk management.\n\nThe unclear prospects for interest rates in major advanced economies and heightened geopolitical tensions have led to increased volatility in global financial markets. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to take the initiative in supervising the market risk management of authorized institutions. Following the uncertain macroeconomic environment, and as banking services become increasingly digital, we will also review how authorized institutions manage liquidity risks, to strengthen their ability to handle sudden capital flows.\n\n# Business tasks and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work to enhance the overall resilience of the banking sector, reviewing banks’ progress in identifying potential risks to maintaining critical operations and making remedies, as part of its implementation of the operational resilience framework.\n\nGiven the increasing reliance of the banking sector on third-party service providers, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will further deepen the management of risks to banks from third parties, and develop new guidance to implement the relevant international standards determined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee).\n\nIn terms of cyber resilience, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will assess systemic cyber risks through the cross-sectoral “Cyber Mapping” project. The project is currently being jointly driven by the HKMA together with other local financial regulatory bodies in accordance with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund. In addition, we will review the implementation by banks of the “robust three-tier data backup” arrangements and launch a cyber resilience testing framework to promote banks’ enhancement of their ability to restore critical operations when facing severe security incidents.\n\nAlthough we keep itself informed of the benefits brought by the wider adoption of high technologies such as GenAI in the banking sector, we will also remain vigilant, closely monitor new risks, and provide guidance on the use of related technologies as demand.\n\nWe will also collaborate with the industry and other related stakeholders, remain agile to respond to challenges, prevent problems before they occur, and enhance banks’ capability to combat digital scams and prevent the ever-changing scam tactics.\n\n# Anti-Money Laundering and countering the Financing of Terrorism.\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will launch regime reforms, innovation and other measures to enhance Hong Kong’s overall resilience in anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism ecosystem, reduce threats from illicit financial flows, and align with the latest international standards and best practices.\n\nAs part of the Government’s inter-departmental co-operation, we will assist in conducting the third Hong Kong Anti-Money Laundering and terrorism Financing risks assessment, to enhance understanding of the potential vulnerabilities brought by technological developments, and to formulate effective and proportionate guidance based on the assessment results, in order to adapt to the implementation of new regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers.\n\nWe will continue to lead and promote the responsible application of technology, including Artificial Intelligence, in areas that bring value to the Public. Related work includes increasing monitoring of suspicious activities, allowing banks to identify and disrupt more scams and fraudulent Account holders, thereby further increasing the high-quality intelligence submitted to law enforcement agencies, which should be helpful in follow-up investigations.\n\nTo strengthen Anti scams and fraud and other financial crime efforts, we will propose the necessary legislative changes recommendations, to create necessary pathways and Protection for banks to share personal Account information. To enhance the speed and volume of detection of illicit funds flows, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will launch related Payment data analysis Platform work.\n\n# Wealth management and related Mandatory Provident Fund business.\n\nIn 2025, the HKMA will conduct on-site and non-site due diligence on authorized institutions’ conduct in relation to their Securities, investment products, trusts, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related business. We will closely monitor high return complex products, Digital assets and related products, “Wealth Management Connect” business, digital distribution and consultation platforms, long-term insurance products and premium financing business, and will take into account the latest market developments and amendments to international standards.\n\nThe HKMA will also maintain close contact with other regulatory agencies and the banking sector, providing guidance on regulatory standards for the sale of securities, investments, insurance and MPF products as needed. To promote the sustainable development of the digital asset industries, We will continue to collaborate with the Government and other regulatory agencies, ensuring a resilient, comprehensive and balancing regulatory framework is developed for the digital asset industries.\n\nBesides, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will promote and monitor the implementation of enhancements to the Wealth Management Connect measures, and will continue to engage with the industry and related regulatory authority to further optimise the Scheme and other bank-related cross-border projects.\n\nWe will also integrate and harmonise existing guidance related to wealth management and Mandatory Provident Fund related business as needed, making it easier for industry practitioners to grasp the HKMA’s regulatory regulation, facilitated maintaining compliance.\n\n# Formulate policies\n\n# Implementing Basel standards in Hong Kong.\n\nThe final reform package of “Basel III” will take effect in Hong Kong on Jan 1, 2025. The HKMA will continue to provide guidance to authorized institutions on common questions regarding the interpretation of the final reform package and will harmonise them, to ensure consistent adoption of the solution by the industry.\n\nThe Basel Committee issued new standards for banks’ prudential treatment of crypto-asset risks in December 2022, and further issued targeted amendments in July 2024 to further harmonise the criteria for stablecoins to receive preferential regulatory treatment. At the same time, the Basel Committee also published documents titled “Disclosure of Crypto-asset Risk Exposures”, setting out updated disclosure requirements for crypto-asset risk exposures. To implement the relevant standards in Hong Kong, the HKMA will study the legislative changes that may be required to the “Banking (Capital) Rules”, “Banking (Disclosure) Rules”, “Banking (Limits on Exposure) Rules” (“Exposure Limits Rules”) and “Banking (Liquidity) Rules”, etc. The HKMA will also, following implementation experience and industry feedback, propose several enhancement recommendations to the “Exposure Limits Rules”. The HKMA will conduct statutory consultation on the amendments in the first half of 2025, to implement the new standards on 1 January 2026, in accordance with the Basel Committee’s timeline. The HKMA will also develop relevant banking sector reporting forms and supporting guidance to facilitate authorized institutions in implementing the new standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines.\n\nTo keep pace with the latest international standards, supervisory methods, and developments in the banking sector, the HKMA plans to update various modules of the Supervisory Policy Manual, including CA-G-5 “Supervisory Review Procedures”, CA-B-2 “Systemically Important Banks”, IC-5 “Stress Testing”, IR-1 “Interest Rate Risk in Banks’ Balance Sheets”, and IC-3 “Requirements for Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors to Submit Reports under the Banking Ordinance”. Module CR-G-13 “Counterparty Credit Risk Management” of the Supervisory Policy Manual will be revised to reflect the robust practices outlined in the “Guidelines for Counterparty Credit Risk Management” issued by the Basel Committee in December 2024.\n\n# Basel Committee’s key principles for the effective supervisory banking sector.\n\nThe Basel Committee issued the revised “Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision” (the “Core Principles”) in April 2024. The revised Core Principles reflect developments in supervision and regulation since the last revision in 2012, as well as the impact of recent structural trends on banks and the banking sector. The HKMA will conduct a detailed self-assessment in 2025 to ensure that its supervisory and regulation framework meets the revised Core Principles.\n\n# Accounting Standards\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board plans to issue a discussion paper on Dynamic Risk Management in 2025.

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有四項：\n\n- 在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；\n- 促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；\n- 協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持及發展香港的金融基建；及\n- 管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授予金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全（惟同時須顧及外匯基金的主要目的），藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》訂明金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。金融管理專員獲賦予一系列權力，對不可持續經營的銀行界實體進行有秩序處置（有關實體倒閉可能構成系統性風險），以維持金融穩定，同時力求保障公帑。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n保險業監管局根據《保險業條例》就銀行的保險相關業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》授權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例下有關客戶盡職審查及備存紀錄的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付的持牌銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察某些重要的結算及交收系統，以及在香港營運的零售支付系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理用作儲存金錢價值並符合該條例指明準則的電子及實物「工具」的發牌制度。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, Functions and responsibilities of the Monetary Authority are set out in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facility Ordinance and other related Ordinances. The Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority exchanged letters on June 25, 2003, which set out the division of functions and responsibilities between them in respect of monetary and financial affairs, and also discloses that the Financial Secretary delegated certain powers to the Monetary Authority. The letters are public documents and can be found on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Ordinance, and is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance requires the Exchange Fund to be primarily used to affect the Hong Kong dollar exchange value. The Financial Secretary may also use the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary financial system(s) (while also considering the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund), with a view to maintaining Hong Kong’s position as an International financial centre.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Chief Executive under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to assist the Financial Secretary in the execution of functions conferred on him under the Ordinance, as well as the execution of other Ordinances and functions assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Monetary Authority is known as the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority is the Chief Executive.\n\nThe Monetary Authority, vested with the mandate and powers conferred upon it under the Banking Ordinance, regulates and supervises banking business and taking deposits. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Monetary Authority has responsibility for handling authorization matters concerning licensed banks, restricted license banks, and authorized institutions accepting deposits in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Mechanism) Ordinance provides that the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for entities in the banking sector. The Monetary Authority is vested with a range of powers to effect the orderly resolution of unsustainable operating entities in the banking sector (the failure of such entities may pose systemic risk), for maintaining financial stability, while seeking to protect public funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance vested the Monetary Authority with certain powers related to bank securities and Mandatory Provident Fund businesses.\n\nThe Insurance Authority, under the Insurance Ordinance, delegates investigation powers relating to the insurance businesses of banks to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Monetary Authority to supervise banks to maintain the requirements of the Ordinance related to customer due diligence and record-keeping.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance confers responsibility on the Monetary Authority to provide assistance with the operations of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to launch payment of compensation from the Exchange Fund Fund to depositors of licensed banks that have failed to meet their obligations.\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under the statutory framework of the Ordinance on Payment Systems and Stored Value Payment Instruments, may specify and monitor certain important clearing and settlement systems, as well as retail payment systems operating in Hong Kong. The Ordinance also empowers the Monetary Authority to manage the licensing regime for “tools” used to store monetary value and meet the Standards specified in the Ordinance.\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n\n- 建立了一套清晰的機構管治架構；\n- 維持高問責性及透明度，並與各持份者保持緊密聯繫；及\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準。\n\n金管局的管治架構涵蓋幾個主要部分，包括給予意見和指導的各法定諮詢委員會、問責性與透明度，以及內部監控與外部審計。\n\n# 金管局與特區政府\n\n金管局是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及管理層\n\n# 諮詢委員會\n\n諮詢委員會就金管局主要工作範疇給予意見和指導。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》成立，就與財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權相關的事宜向其提供意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員各以本身的專業知識及經驗獲得委任，使外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下設有五個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定範疇的工作和給予意見，並透過諮詢委員會向財政政司長報告及提出建議。有關外匯基金諮詢委員會及其轄下五個專責委員會的詳情，請參閱第53至63頁。\n\n銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會就有關《銀行業條例》，特別是有關銀行、接受存款公司及有限制牌照銀行經營銀行業務或接受存款業務（視屬何情況而定）的事宜，向香港特別行政區行政長官提供意見。兩個委員會均由財政司司長擔任主席，成員包括金融管理專員及財政司司長根據行政長官的授權而委任的人士。有關銀行業務諮詢委員會及接受存款公司諮詢委員會的詳情，請參閱第64至65頁。\n\n# 管理層\n\n總裁委員會由金管局總裁、副總裁及其他高層人員組成，並由金管局總裁擔任主席。總裁委員會定期開會，向總裁匯報金管局各部門主要工作的進度，並就與金管局運作有關的政策事項向總裁提供意見。有關總裁委員會成員名單，請參閱第66至67頁。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n# 與公眾溝通\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任。金管局與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫，又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局亦盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項，尤其透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n此外，金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放六日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能一章（第185至191頁）。\n\n# 立法會\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年三次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。金管局總裁定期在財經事務委員會作出的簡報載於金管局網站。\n\n此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 資訊披露\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演講辭及簡報會資料文件。\n\n金管局不時檢討外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的披露是否足夠。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n# 內部監控與外部審計\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任識別及評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和匯報各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

central banking institution, deeply understands the importance of good governance to maintain and uphold Public confidence in the HKMA fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, and therefore continues its efforts to adhere to high standards of corporate governance.\n\nTo fulfill the commitment to good corporate governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n\nA clear corporate governance framework has been established;\nmaintaining high accountability and transparency, and operating in co-operation with all stakeholders; and\nimplementing refined robust controls to manage risk, and ensuring the behaviours of staff at all levels and their day-to-day operations all meet specified standards.\n\nThe HKMA’s governance frameworks cover several key parts, including the various statutory Advisory Committees providing advice and guidance, accountability and transparency, and internal controls and external audit.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the SAR Government\n\nThe Monetary Authority is part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the SAR Government) framework, but can hire staff under terms of employment different from those of civil servants, to attract talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority and its staff are all public staff. The day-to-day operations of the Monetary Authority are highly autonomous within the scope of statutory powers vested or delegated to the Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives and monetary structure of Hong Kong. In a letter to the Monetary Authority dated June 25, 2003, the Financial Secretary provides that monetary stability shall be maintained through the monetary issuance system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at around 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Monetary Authority is responsible on his own for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including determining the related strategies, tools and implementation method, and has responsibility for maintaining the stability and integrity of the Hong Kong monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Affairs and the Treasury Bureau, has responsibility for maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s financial system(s), as well as the policy of preserving Hong Kong’s financial centre status. To implement these policies, the Monetary Authority’s mandate includes:\n\n- Promote the overall stability and effective operations of the banking sector;\n- Collaborate with other related institutions and organisations to develop the debt market;\n- Handle matters related to the issuance and circulation of statutory banknotes and coins;\n- Through developing payment, clearing and settlement systems, and being responsible for operating related systems where appropriate, promote the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure; and\n- Collaborate with other related institutions and organisations to promote confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and implement appropriate market development measures to assist in strengthening the international competitiveness of Hong Kong financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Monetary Authority shall be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the deployment and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on powers delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Advisory Committee and Management levels\n\n# Advisory Committee\n\nThe Advisory Committee provides advice and guidance on the HKMA’s main areas of work.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance to provide advice to the Financial Secretary on matters related to the exercise of control over the Exchange Fund. The Financial Secretary serves as the ex-officio Chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and other members (including the Monetary Authority) are appointed by the Financial Secretary, with the authorization of the Chief Executive, in a personal capacity. Each member is appointed with their own professional knowledge and experience to benefit the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized committees under it, responsible for monitoring the HKMA’s work in specific areas and providing advice, and reporting to and offering recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Advisory Committee. For details regarding the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and its five specialized committees, see pages 53 to 63.\n\nThe Advisory Committees on banking business and Deposittaking company provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region regarding the Banking Ordinance, Special relating to banks, Deposittaking companies and restricted license banks operating banking business or taking deposits (depending on the case). Both committees are chaired by the Financial Secretary, with members including the Monetary Authority and individuals appointed by the Financial Secretary with the authorization of the Chief Executive. For details on the Advisory Committees on banking business and Deposittaking company, See pages 64 to 65.\n\n# Management\n\nThe Chief Executive Committee is comprised of the Chief Executive of the HKMA, the Deputy Chief Executive, and other high-level staff, and serves as Chair by the Chief Executive of the HKMA. The Chief Executive Committee will hold regular meetings, report progress on the main work of various departments of the HKMA to the Chief Executive, and provide advice to the Chief Executive on policy issues related to the operations of the HKMA. For the list of Chief Executive Committee members, see pages 66 to 67.\n\n# Accountability and transparency\n\nRegarding the methods adopted for day-to-day operations and implementing government policy objectives, the HKMA has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy, and is complemented by high accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the Monetary Authority is responsible to the Public through the Financial Secretary; and as the powers of the Monetary Authority are determined by legislation passed by the Legislative Council, the Monetary Authority is also responsible to the Public through the Legislative Council. The Monetary Authority also recognises its own broader responsibilities, promote public understanding of the Monetary Authority’s role and objectives, and closely monitor issues of concern to individuals. In carrying out its day-to-day work and maintaining extensive contacts with the community, the Monetary Authority adheres to efforts to enhance transparency and maintain open policies. This policy has two main objectives:\n\nTo the extent permissible under statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market sensitivity, commercial secrecy, and confidential data, enable the financial community and the Public to have a full understanding of the work of the HKMA; and\nensure the HKMA stays in touch with the pulse of society, and make appropriate responses to public opinion.\n\n# Communicate with the Public\n\nThe HKMA strives to promote monetary and banking sector stability, effectively manage official Reserves, develop and monitor resilient and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s international Financial Centre status and promote Hong Kong’s economic development.\n\nThe HKMA must effectively fulfill its responsibilities to gain the trust of people. Therefore, the HKMA adopts a rigorous approach to fulfill its responsibility to explain its policies and work to the public. The HKMA maintains extensive contacts with the media and leverages social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the Digital age. The HKMA also strives to handle matters of public concern involving the scope of the HKMA’s duties, especially by clarifying inaccurate information and rumors related to the HKMA’s policies through traditional and social media.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA office is equipped with an Information Centre, which comprises a library and exhibition area, open to the Public six days a week for visits and use. Related work of the HKMA’s communications and linkage with the Public, See chapter 1 (pages 185 to 191) for more details.\n\n# Legislative Council\n\nThe relationship between the HKMA and the Legislative Council is very important for enhancing accountability and transparency. The Chief Executive of the HKMA has committed to providing briefings to the Financial Affairs Committee of the Legislative Council three times a year on the HKMA’s various work and policies, and to answer related questions. Briefing sessions provided by the Chief Executive of the HKMA to the Financial Affairs Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\nBesides, representatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority attend meetings of the Legislative Council Affairs Committee and sub-committee meetings from time to time to explain and discuss particular issues, and to assist Members in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Information disclosure\n\nThe hkma strives to achieve International highest standards in terms of transparency, published various Chinese and English journals and publications. The hkma’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) not only carries a special session set out economic research, statistical data, supervisory resources, consumers information and other topics, but also are included a large number of publications, press releases, speeches and briefing session documents published by the hkma.\n\nThe HKMA periodically reviews the adequacy of disclosure of Exchange Fund and Currency Board accounting data. The HKMA began to participate in the International Monetary Fund’s “Special Data Dissemination Standard” for central banks in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Currency Issuance Committee, as well as reports on the operations of the Currency Board System. Since 1996, the HKMA website has included banking sector regulatory policies and guidance.\n\n# Internal controls and external audit\n\nThe HKMA adopts robust and effective control mechanisms, ensuring high standards of staff conduct, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessment of whether the control mechanisms are adequate and have an impact.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance to staff on ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring all staff at all levels behaviours meet specified standards.\n\n# Internal controls\n\n# Operations controls\n\nAs a first line of defense in risk management, all departments and divisions are responsible for identifying and assessing the risks of their work processes, and for developing appropriate controls to ensure the HKMA’s day-to-day operations are proper.\n\n# Corporate risk management\n\nRisk management is also conducted at the corporate level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, is one of the cornerstones of the institution’s risk management framework.\n\nThe risk committee reviews and reports on potential and new risks identified by each department, as well as whether related controls and mitigating strategies are sufficient, and establishes appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Internal audit\n\nThe HKMA’s internal audits department independently assesses the governance procedures, risk management and control measures of different departments to determine their adequacy and effectiveness, and issues recommendations for improvement.\n\n# external audit\n\nAccording to section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Audit Commission of the Hong Kong SAR Government. The Audit Commission does not charge costs for this service. The audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund are published in the HKMA annual report.\n"}
{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2024年錄得溫和增長，主要受惠於貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦下有所反彈。勞工市場保持穩健，通脹在外圍價格壓力進一步減退下維持溫和。本港股市顯著回升，而物業市場則因市場氣氛在持續高息環境下受壓而大致疲弱。鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升級，預計2025年香港經濟將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，中國內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，加上為本地企業提供的多方面支持，應能鞏固營商信心。香港亦會繼續加強國際交往合作，以及深化區域合作。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n香港經濟在2024年溫和增長。實質本地生產總值繼2023年錄得3.2%的增幅後，在2024年按年上升2.5%（表1及圖1）。外圍方面，貨物出口在外部需求改善及全球科技周期復甦的帶動下恢復正增長，成為整體經濟增長的主要動力。服務輸出亦隨着訪港旅遊業的持續復甦，以及跨境金融及集資活動於下半年顯著增加而進一步增長。然而，由於服務輸入在出境旅遊業持續增長下顯著上升，抵銷了服務輸出對整體經濟增長所帶來的正面效應。本地方面，私人消費開支在本地居民的消費模式轉變下有所回軟。相反，物業成交增加以及營商氣氛在貨幣狀況逐步放寬下有所改善，帶動整體投資支出錄得輕微增長。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n註：經季節性調整的本地固定資本形成總額按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n儘管新簽訂私人住宅租金逐步上升，本地成本壓力仍大致受控，加上外圍價格壓力逐步減退，本地通脹在2024年維持溫和（圖2）。2024年全年合計，基本及整體通脹率分別為1.1%及1.7%。\n\n勞工市場在2024年表現穩健，失業率全年在2.9%至3.1%的低位徘徊（圖3）。自第1季起，總就業人數（圖3）逐步上升，勞動人口亦見增加，反映勞工需求與供應大致保持穩定。與此同時，隨着經濟持續增長，名義工資與勞工收入均錄得穩健增長。此外，政府在2024年《施政報告》中宣布進一步優化香港的吸引人才計劃，以紓緩不同行業的人手短缺問題，並透過吸納更多年輕人，為本地人口注入新動力。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處\n\n# 股市\n\n本港股市隨着9月中以來的大幅反彈，於2024年顯著轉向。具體而言，隨着美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）減息及內地推出積極的經濟刺激措施，市場氣氛顯著改善，帶動恒生指數在10月7日升至全年高位，收報23,100點（圖4）。然而，11月初舉行的美國總統選舉觸發市場對全球經濟前景及美聯儲放寬貨幣政策步伐的憂慮，本港股市略為回調。儘管如此，恒生指數於年底收報20,060點，較2023年年底大幅上升17.7%，終結連續四年下挫的走勢。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2024年首三季大致疲軟，但在第4季出現回穩跡象。在2月底及10月中相關政策措施放寬，以及9月開始的減息周期的支持下，全年住宅成交量由2023年43,002宗的歷史低位大幅上升23.5%至2024年的53,099宗。然而，持續高企的按揭利率及一手市場累積的庫存，繼續對樓價構成下調壓力。因此，樓價在2024年按年下跌7.1%，置業負擔能力亦因而稍為改善，雖然仍屬偏緊。非住宅物業市場仍然疲弱。其中，寫字樓的空置率在供應充裕的情況下仍然高企，零售商舖則面對旅客與本地居民消費模式轉變所帶來的挑戰。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n鑑於貿易緊張局勢不斷升溫，並很可能會對國際貿易與資金流造成干擾，預計香港經濟於2025年將會面對充滿挑戰的外圍環境。然而，各有關當局及銀行業持續提供多方面的支持，應能提升本地企業的抗禦能力。內地積極推出經濟刺激措施，並且在前沿科技領域取得重大突破，亦應能提振營商信心。與此同時，香港會進一步深化區域合作，並加快聯動新興市場。同時，在內地當局的惠港旅遊政策，以及政府致力提振香港旅遊業的支持下，預計訪港旅遊業將會進一步增長。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預期本地通脹於2025年將保持溫和。由於房屋租金上升將逐步傳遞至消費物價，本地成本可能面對輕微的上升壓力。然而，儘管環球經濟前景的不確定性有所增加，但外圍價格壓力應會保持溫和。另一方面，勞工市場或會因貿易緊張局勢升溫而面對挑戰。然而，各項吸引人才計劃應有助繼續建立優質人才庫，為經濟長遠發展提供支持。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健，銀行的資本及流動性均十分充裕。在宏觀經濟環境充滿挑戰下，年內銀行體系面對的信用風險增加，但銀行的整體資產質素維持可控。受惠於來自持有作交易的投資收益與收費及佣金收入上升，零售銀行盈利較2023年有所增長。\n\n# 資產質素\n\n銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的1.57%上升至2024年底的1.96%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由1.24%升至1.55%（圖5）。特定分類貸款比率上升，主要是部分內地房地產發展商以及本地中小型發展商和投資者的貸款評級被下調所導致。然而，中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由2023年底的2.58%，下降至2024年底的2.38%。銀行撥備維持充足。截至2024年底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即信貸撥備和特定分類貸款比率）約為65%。若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，經調整的銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約145%。與此同時，2024年底住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低水平，分別為0.11%及0.35%（圖6）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的資產質素\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 6 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2024年的整體除稅前經營溢利增加8.4%，同期除稅後平均資產回報率則由0.88%上升至0.93%（圖7）。盈利增長主要是由於持有作交易的投資收益（+97.0%）與收費及佣金收入增加（+15.4%），但部分升幅被淨利息收入減少（–5.2%）所抵銷。零售銀行淨息差由2023年的1.67%收窄至 2024 年的 1.52%（圖8）。與此同時，零售銀行成本與收入比率由2023年的38.9%微升至2024年的39.2%（圖9）。\n\n圖 7 零售銀行的表現\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 8 零售銀行淨息差\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 9 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n資料來源：金管局\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n銀行體系資產負債表在2024年擴大4.3%，主要是因為可轉讓債務工具增加（+13.4%）。由於借貸成本高企，貸款需求受壓，2024年貸款總額減少2.8%。其中在香港使用的貸款與在香港境外使用的貸款分別減少2.1%及5.7%，貿易融資則增加4.6%。中國內地相關貸款於2024年減少8.7%。\n\n在資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額於2024年增加7.1%，相比2023年的增幅為5.1%。由於貸款總額減少而存款總額增加，整體貸存比率由2023底的62.8%降至2024年底的57.0%（圖10）。\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n銀行體系在2024年資本維持充裕。2024年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率為21.8%，相比上一年為21.1%；一級資本比率為19.9%（圖11）。兩者均遠高於相關國際最低要求。《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率於2024 年底為 8.0%（圖12）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n資料來源：金管局\n\n圖 11

流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在2024年第4季為178.4%，第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為67.0%（圖13）。銀行體系的主要資金來源仍然是客戶存款。於2024年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率及第2A類機構的核心資金比率分別為143.4%及186.7%（圖14）。以上所有四個比率均遠高於法定最低要求。\n\n圖 13

economy recorded moderate growth in 2024, mainly driven by a rebound in merchandise exports as external demand improved and the global technology cycle recovered. The labor market remained resilient, and inflation remained moderate as external price pressures further eased. The Hong Kong stock market rebounded significantly, while the property market remained largely soft due to market sentiment being pressured by continued high interest rates. Given the escalating international trade tensions, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, mainland China’s proactive launch of economic stimulus measures, together with the multifaceted support provided to local enterprises, are expected to consolidate business confidence. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen international collaboration and deepen regional cooperation.\n\n# Economic review\n\n# Real economic activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy experienced moderate growth in 2024. Real Gross Domestic Product, following a 3.2% increase in 2023, rose by 2.5% year on year in 2024 (Table 1 and Chart 1). On the external front, merchandise exports rebounded to positive growth, driven by improving external demand and the recovery of the global technology cycle, becoming a major impetus for overall economic growth. Exports of services also grew further, supported by the continued recovery of inbound tourism, as well as a significant increase in cross-border finance and fundraising activities in the second half of the year. However, as imports of services rose significantly due to continued growth in outbound tourism, this offset the positive effect of exports of services on overall economic growth. Domestically, private consumption expenditure softened somewhat due to changes in the consumption patterns of local residents. Conversely, increased property transactions and an improved business atmosphere, as monetary conditions were gradually relaxed, led to a slight increase in overall investment expenditure.\n\nFigure 1 Contribution to the growth of real local gross domestic product by sector\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Growth of Real Local Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Approach (Compared with Previous Period)\nNote: The increases or decreases in the quarterly total of fixed local capital formation, seasonally adjusted, are not detailed.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nDespite newly signed residential rental income gradually increasing, local cost pressures remain broadly manageable, together with diminishing external price pressures, keeping local inflation moderate in 2024 (Chart 2). For the year as a whole in 2024, the basic and overall inflation rates were 1.1% and 1.7% respectively.\n\nThe labour market demonstrated robust performance in 2024, with the unemployment rate remaining low at between 2.9% and 3.1% throughout the year (Figure 3). Total employment numbers (Figure 3) have gradually increased since the first quarter, and the labour force has also grown, reflecting a broadly stable balance between labour demand and supply. Simultaneously, with the continued economic growth, nominal wages and labour income both recorded resilient growth. Furthermore, the Government announced in the 2024 Policy Report that it would further enhance Hong Kong’s talent attraction Scheme to alleviate manpower shortages in various industries, and by attracting more young people, inject new impetus into the local population.\n\nFigure 2 Basic Consumption Price Inflation\nSource of Information: Census and Statistics Department\n\nFigure 3 Labour Market Situation\nSource of information: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market showed a significant turnaround in 2024 following a substantial rebound since mid-September. Specifically, with the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and the Mainland launching proactive economic stimulus measures, market sentiment improved significantly, driving the Hang Seng Index to a year-to-date high of 23,100 points on Oct 7, closing at that level (Figure 4). However, the US presidential election held in early November triggered concerns about the global economic prospects and the pace of the Federal Reserve’s relaxation of monetary policy, leading to a slight pullback in the Hong Kong stock market. Despite this, the Hang Seng Index closed at 20,060 points at the end of the year, a substantial increase of 17.7% compared to the end of 2023, ending a streak of annual declines over four years.\n\n# property market\n\nThe residential property market was generally soft in the first three months of 2024, but showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter. With the support of relaxed related policy measures at the end of February and mid-October, as well as the beginning of the interest rate cut cycle in September, the whole year’s residential transactions surged by 23.5% from a record-low of 43,002 transactions in 2023 to 53,099 transactions in 2024. However, persistently high mortgage interest rates and accumulated inventory in the primary market continued to put downward pressure on property prices. As a result, property prices declined by 7.1% year on year in 2024, and housing affordability was also slightly improved, although it remained tight. The non-residential property market remained soft. Among them, the vacancy rate of office buildings remained high amid robust supplies, while retail shops faced challenges brought about by changes in the consumption patterns of visitors and local residents.\n\nFigure 4 Asset Prices\nSource of information: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# economic prospects\n\n# Economic environment\n\nGiven the heightened trade tensions, which are likely to disrupt international trade and capital flows, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to face a challenging external environment in 2025. However, various related authorities and the banking sector continue to provide multifaceted support, which should enhance the resilience of local enterprises. Mainland China is proactively launching economic stimulus measures and has also achieved significant breakthroughs in cutting-edge technology, which should also boost business confidence. At the same time, Hong Kong will further deepen regional cooperation and accelerate linkages with emerging markets. Furthermore, with Mainland authorities’ favorable tourism policies for Hong Kong and the Government’s dedication to boosting Hong Kong’s tourism industry, inbound tourism is expected to grow further.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nLocal inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2025. As rising rental income gradually passes through to consumer prices, local costs may face slight pressure. However, despite heightened global economic uncertainties, external price pressures should remain mild. On the other hand, the labour market may face challenges as trade tensions increase. However, various talent attraction schemes should help continue to develop a quality talent pool, providing support for long-term economic development.\n\n# Banking sector performance\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector remains resilient in 2024, with banks’ capital and liquidity both robust. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, credit risks facing the banking sector increased during the year, but the overall asset quality of banks remains manageable. Driven by gains from investments held for trading and increasing fees and commission income, retail banking profit grew compared to 2023.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe banking sector’s sector-specific classified loan ratio rose from 1.57% at the end of 2023 to 1.96% at the end of 2024, while the ratio of delinquent and restructured loans increased from 1.24% to 1.55% during the same period (Figure 5). The increase in the sector-specific classified loan ratio was mainly due to downgrades in the loan ratings of some Mainland real estate developers, as well as local small and medium-sized developers and investors. However, the sector-specific classified loan ratio for Mainland China-related loans decreased from 2.58% at the end of 2023 to 2.38% at the end of 2024. Banks’ loan loss reserves remained sufficient. As at the end of 2024, the banking credit provisioning coverage ratio (i.e., credit provisioning and sector-specific classified loan ratio) was about 65%. If the value of collateral is deducted from the outstanding balance of bad debts, the adjusted banking credit provisioning coverage ratio is approximately 145%. At the same time, the delinquency ratios for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans at the end of 2024 remained at low levels, at 0.11% and 0.35% respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset quality of the banking sector\nData source: HKMA\n\nFigure 6: Delinquency ratios of residential mortgage loans and credit card loans\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Profit trend\n\nRetail banking’s overall profit before tax increased by 8.4% in 2024, while the average return on assets after tax for the same period rose from 0.88% to 0.93% (Figure 7). Profit growth was mainly due to gains from investments held for trading (+97.0%) and increased fee and commission income (+15.4%), but part of the increase was offset by a decrease in net interest income (–5.2%). The net interest margin of retail banking narrowed from 1.67% in 2023 to 1.52% in 2024 (Figure 8). At the same time, the cost-to-income ratio of retail banking rose slightly from 38.9% in 2023 to 39.2% in 2024 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7 Retail banks’ performance\nSource: The Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 8 Retail bank net interest margin\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 9 Retail banking cost and income ratios\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet expanded by 4.3% in 2024, mainly due to an increase in transferable debt instruments (+13.4%). Due to still-high borrowing costs, loan demand was suppressed, and the total loan amount decreased by 2.8% in 2024. Among these, loans used in Hong Kong and those used outside Hong Kong decreased by 2.1% and 5.7% respectively, while trade finance increased by 4.6%. Related loans to Mainland China decreased by 8.7% in 2024.\n\nRegarding the liability side of the balance sheet, the total amount of deposits increased by 7.1% in 2024, compared to an increase of 5.1% in 2023. Due to a decrease in the total amount of loans and an increase in the total amount of deposits, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 62.8% at the end of 2023 to 57.0% at the end of 2024 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital adequacy ratio\n\nThe banking sector maintains robust capital in 2024. At the end of 2024, the consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions was 21.8%, compared to 21.1% for the previous year; the primary capital ratio was 19.9% (Chart 11). Both are well above the related International minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 8.0% at the end of 2024 (Chart 12).\n\nFigure 10: Loans and deposits in the banking sector\nData source: Monetary Authority.\n\nFigure 11 Local incorporated authorized institutions’ consolidated capital ratios\nSource: HKMA\n\nFigure 12 Local incorporated authorized institutions’ consolidated leverage ratios\nSource: HKMA\n\n# Liquidity situation\n\nThe banking sector’s liquidity position remains resilient. The quarterly Average liquidity coverage ratio of category... institutions was 178.4% in the 2024 fourth quarter, and the quarterly Average liquidity maintenance ratio of 2nd category... institutions was 67.0% (Chart 13). The primary source of funds for the banking sector remains customer deposits. At the end of 2024, the net stable funding ratio of 1st category... institutions and the core capital ratio of 2A category... institutions were 143.4% and 186.7%, respectively (Chart 14). All four of these ratios are well above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13 specified authorized institutions’ liquidity ratios\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 14: Coverage ratio of designated authorized institutions\nSource of information: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管美國貨幣政策走向、環球增長前景及地緣政治局勢緊張存在不明朗因素港元外匯及貨幣市場繼續保持暢順有序。港元匯率在2024年首四個月回軟，然後在年內其餘時間轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率的走勢，同時亦受本地供求情況影響。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一直展現強大抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n- 負債證明書（為三間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）；\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣；\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）；及\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在2024年首四個月，港元隨着流動性回軟而稍為轉弱。在4月下旬至5月中期間，主要在股息相關資金需求及股票市場交投活躍的支持下，港元匯率轉強。在8月初，由於市場一度憂慮美國經濟可能出現衰退，以及預期美國聯邦儲備局將以更快及更大幅度減息，觸發套息交易平倉及港元短倉平倉，使港元轉強至兌換保證範圍的強方。港元在9月下旬進一步走強，受惠於內地公布一系列經濟刺激措施後，本港股市交投急增。港元其後於11月初稍為轉弱，部分由於本港股市的升幅有所回落，部分則由於其時美國經濟表現強勁，給予聯邦公開市場委員會空間謹慎地調低聯邦基金利率所致。其後港元在年底季節性資金需求帶動下回升。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2024年全年繼續運作正常（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 2024年市場匯率\n\n由於年內並無觸發兌換保證，總結餘變動不大，維持在447億港元左右。與此同時，未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由12,455億港元，稍增至13,839億港元。因此，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2023 年底的 12,904 億港元，增加至 2024 年底的 14,287億港元（圖2）。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2024年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，香港銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，當中短期拆息亦受本地供求情況影響。隨着市場對美國政策利率下調的預期逐漸升溫，香港銀行同業拆息在2024年首八個月大致回軟（圖3）。在季末季節性資金需求及股市交投活躍的推動下，香港銀行同業拆息於9月下旬收緊，隔夜拆息於季末更一度升至6厘以上。其後香港銀行同業拆息大致穩定，至年底前因流動性相對減少而上升。全年計，隔夜、一個月及三個月香港銀行同業拆息分別下跌45、69及78基點至年底時的5.65厘、4.58厘及4.37厘。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，基本利率下調三次，合共一個百分點（即100基點），由5.75厘下跌至4.75厘（圖3）。在零售層面，隨着美國下調政策利率，多間銀行在9月中調低最優惠貸款利率25基點，並在11月初及12月下旬分別再調低25基點及12.5基點。在此情況下，新造按揭貸款平均利率亦由2023年的4.13厘下跌至2024年12月的3.59厘。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2023年的388億港元增至2024年的500億港元；貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。\n\n圖 3 2024年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年以來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，展現強大應對挑戰的能力。儘管美國政策利率走向存在不確定因素，以及地緣經濟碎片化，港元外匯及貨幣市場維持有序運作，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在《2024年對外部門報告》一再重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、龐大的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本狀況以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備抵禦衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性與利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）由2023年底的110.73%上升至2024年9月10日的112.65%高位，超出112.5%的觸發上限（圖4），當中主要來自投資的利息及投資按市價重估。按照外匯基金諮詢委員會批准的安排，從支持組合轉撥資產至投資組合，令支持比率於9月11日降至110.08%左右。其後支持比率大致保持穩定，於12月31日收報109.56%。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2024年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2024年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港銀行業對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔，以及主要先進經濟體的最新貨幣政策實施框架。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n圖 5

香港鈔票\n\n年內金管局舉辦14場有關香港鈔票設計及防偽特徵的講座，吸引超過2,600人參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、零售店舖收銀員及學生，有助提高他們鑑別鈔票的知識及技巧。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃繼續受到市民歡迎。有關計劃詳情載於《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「可持續發展的金管局」一章。\n\n# 美元流動資金安排\n\n金管局推出美元流動資金安排的優化措施，包括將交收周期由T+1縮短至T+0，於5月24日生效。此項恆常流動資金安排可在持牌銀行有需要時為其提供備用流動性，尤其是在5月28日美國開始實施交收周期縮短至T+1的情況下。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及債券\n\n外匯基金票據及債券計劃繼續暢順運作。截至2024年底，未償還外匯基金票據及債券名義總值約為13,068億港元（表2）。\n\n表 2 未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n在2024年，金融學院轄下負責研究工作的香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）發表15份對香港以至區內具戰略重要性的貨幣與金融研究議題的研究論文，並透過五期開放取用電子期刊與全球讀者分享研究成果。研究中心亦出版兩份《Insights from MonetaryResearch》，就其近期發表的研究論文為公眾提供高層次非技術性的概要。\n\n除研究工作外，研究中心舉辦一系列知識交流活動，促進與不同參與者的聯繫。年內舉辦31場以本地參與者為對象的研討會或網上研討會，探討重要貨幣及金融研究議題。在國際層面，金融學院與研究中心聯同學術機構、各國央行及國際金融機構舉辦四次國際會議及五次研討會或圓桌會議，促進就廣泛經濟及金融事務的對話與交流。\n\n這些國際活動包括：\n\n4月11日\n\n與金管局及香港科技大學合辦\n\n6月6至7日 「NBER東亞經濟研討會2024」\n\n與美國全國經濟研究所、國際結算銀行及香港科技大學商學院合辦\n\n7月15至16日\n\n與基金組織、國際結算銀行及東盟與中日韓宏觀經濟研究辦公室合辦\n\n10月14至15日\n\n第14屆年度中國經濟國際研討會—「中國及全球貿易結構的演變：挑戰與機遇」\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

surrounding the direction of the US monetary policy, global growth prospects, and geopolitical tensions, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and monetary market continued to operate smoothly and orderly. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate softened in the first four months of 2024, and then strengthened for the rest of the year. Under the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong interbank offered rates generally followed the trend of US interest rates, while also being affected by local supply and demand. As a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated strong resilience in withstanding external shocks.\n\n# objective\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, that is, to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange value, to enable the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar in the external exchange market to remain within the range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 to 1 US dollar. This monetary system adopts a currency board system, requiring that the US dollar Reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100 percent support to the monetary base; if there are changes in the monetary base, US dollar Reserves shall also make corresponding increases or decreases, in order to adapt to the percentage change in the monetary base.\n\nCurrency foundation (Table 1) includes:\n\n- Liabilities Certificate(s) of Indebtedness (provided full support for banknotes issued by three banks);\n- Currency notes and coins issued by the Government;\n- Aggregate Balance of clearing Account(s) held at the HKMA (i.e. Aggregate Balance); and\n- Exchange Fund Bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1 Currency foundation\n\nThe HKMA maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automated interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange Convertibility. When the strong-side (or weak-side) exchange guarantee is triggered, the HKMA will be standing ready to sell Hong Kong dollars and purchase US dollars to banks at 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar (or purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar) upon bank request, to increase (or decrease) the Aggregate Balance, causing Hong Kong dollar interest rate to fall (or rise), thereby prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the exchange scope of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nIn the first four months of 2024, the Hong Kong dollar weakened slightly as liquidity softened. From late April to mid-May, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened, supported by demand for dividends and vibrant trading in the stock market. In early August, the Hong Kong dollar strengthened to the strong-side of the Convertibility range, triggered by initial market concerns about a potential recession in the US and expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates at a faster and more substantial pace, prompting unwinding of carry trades and short positions in the Hong Kong dollar. The Hong Kong dollar further strengthened in late September, driven by a surge in local stock trading following the announcement of a range of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China. The Hong Kong dollar then weakened slightly in early November, partly due to a moderation in the gains of the local stock market, and partly because the strong US economic performance at the time gave the Federal Open Market Committee room for prudent reductions in the Federal funds rate. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar rebounded under the impetus of seasonal funding demand at the end of the year. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2024 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 2024 markets exchange rate\n\nAs there was no triggering of the exchange guarantee during the year, the Aggregate Balance remained relatively stable at around HK$447 billion. At the same time, the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Notes and bonds increased slightly from HK$12,455 billion to HK$13,839 billion. Consequently, the Aggregate Balance and the outstanding amount of Exchange Fund Notes and bonds increased from HK$1,290.4 billion at the end of 2023 to HK$1,428.7 billion at the end of 2024 (Figure 2). The overall monetary foundation remains fully backed by foreign exchange Reserves.\n\nFigure 2 2024 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window activities) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and bonds\n\n# Currency Market\n\nUnder the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally follow the trend of US interest rates, with short-dated rates also affected by local supply and demand. As market expectations for a reduction in US policy rates gradually increase, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rates broadly softened in the first eight months of 2024 (Figure 3). Driven by end-of-quarter seasonal funds demand and vibrant stock market activity, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rates tightened in late September, with the overnight rate briefly rising above 6 percent at the end of the quarter. Thereafter, Hong Kong’s interbank offered rates were generally stable, rising before the end of the year due to a relative decrease in liquidity. For the whole year, the overnight, one-month, and three-month Hong Kong’s interbank offered rates fell by 45, 69, and 78 basis points respectively, to 5.65 percent, 4.58 percent, and 4.37 percent at year-end.\n\nFollowing the downward adjustment of the US Federal funds rate target range, the base rate was lowered three times, totaling one percentage point (i.e., 100 basis points), from 5.75 percent to 4.75 percent (Figure 3). At the retail level, as the US lowered policy rates, more banks lowered their best lending rates by 25 basis points in mid-September, and further lowered them by 25 basis points and 12.5 basis points respectively in early November and late December. Under these conditions, the average interest rate for new mortgage loans also fell from 4.13 percent in 2023 to 3.59 percent in December 2024. Overall, the Hong Kong currency market continued to operate normally. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$38.8 billion in 2023 to HK$50 billion in 2024; the usage of the Discount Window showed no abnormality.\n\nFigure 3 2024 year Hong Kong interbank lending rate.\n\n# Linked exchange rate System\n\nSince 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate system has been an important pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, demonstrating a strong ability to respond to challenges. Despite uncertainties surrounding the direction of US policy rates and geo-economic fragmentation, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and currency market has maintained orderly operations, reflecting the resilience and effectiveness of the Linked Exchange Rate system. The Government also remains firmly committed to maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate system. The International Monetary Fund (the Fund) repeatedly emphasized in its 2024 External Sector Report that Hong Kong has transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange Reserves, robust financial regulation and supervision, an agile economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate system.\n\nA resilient banking sector plays a critical role in the smooth operations of the linked exchange rate system. Hong Kong’s banking sector continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions being robust by international standards. To ensure the banking sector has the ability to withstand shocks, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as stress testing results, and maintaining supervision of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, since October 1998, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets have been designated to support the monetary base. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) rose from 110.73% at the end of 2023 to a high of 112.65% on September 10, 2024, exceeding the trigger limit of 112.5% (Figure 4), primarily due to interest from investments and the revaluation of investments at market prices. In accordance with arrangements approved by the Advisory Committee, assets were allocated from the supporting portfolio to the investment portfolio, bringing the support ratio down to around 110.08% on September 11. Subsequently, the support ratio remained broadly stable, closing at 109.56% on December 31. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the supporting portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund’s assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s large financial resources, together with Hong Kong’s resilient banking sector, provide a strong backing for safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nFigure 4 2024 year support ratio daily changes\n\n# Currency issuance Committee\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Currency Issuance Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing topics related to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. In 2024, the topics explored by the Currency Issuance Committee include the exposure of Hong Kong banks to non-bank financial institutions, and the implementation framework of the latest monetary policies in major advanced economies. Records of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the reports on the operations of the Exchange Fund System submitted to the HKMA are all published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\nFigure 5 2024 at the end of the year breakdown of banknotes circulation amount by issuing bank.\n\nFigure 6 2024 year-end circulation of banknotes distribution situation\n\nFigure 7 2024 at the end of the year bank banknotes circulation amount.\n\nFigure 8 2024 at the end of the year government issuance notes and coins circulation amount.\n\nFigure 9 2024 at the end of the year government issuance circulation banknotes and coins analysis\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority held 14 sessions related to the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, attracting more than 2,600 persons to participate, including bank teller personnel, retail establishments cashiers and students, which help enhance their knowledge and skills in identifying banknotes.\n\n# coins collecting plan\n\nThe coin collection plan continues to be popular with residents. Details of the plan are included in the “Sustainable Banking and Finance” chapter of the “2024 Sustainable Development Report”.\n\n# US dollar liquidity arrangements\n\nThe HKMA launched enhancements to the US dollar liquidity facility, including shortening the settlement cycle from T+1 to T+0, effective May 24. This standing liquidity facility can provide backup liquidity for licensed banks when needed, particularly given the United States’ implementation of a shortened settlement cycle to T+1 starting on May 28.\n\n# External Exchange Fund Notes and bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bond schemes continued to operate smoothly. As at the end of 2024, the outstanding nominal total of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and bonds was about 13,068 billion Hong Kong dollars (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 outstanding Exchange Fund Notes and bonds\n\n# Currency Research\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Research Centre (Research Centre) assisted by the Finance Academy published 15 research papers on currency and financial research topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the regional area, and through five issues of open access e-journals share research achievements with global readers. The Research Centre also published two issues of “Insights from Monetary Research”, providing the public with high-level non-technical statements of its recently published research.\n\nBesides research work, the Research Centre organises a range of knowledge exchange activities to promote connections with different participants. Throughout the year, 31 workshops or online seminars were held for local participants to explore important currency and financial research topics. On the international level, the Academy of Finance together with the Research Centre, in collaboration with academic institutions, central banks of various countries and International Financial institutions, held four International Conferences and five workshops or round table meetings, to promote dialogue and exchange on a wide range of economic and financial affairs.\n\nThese International activities include:\n\nApr 11\n\nCo-host with the HKMA and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nJune 6 to 7 “NBER East Asia Economic Conference 2024”\n\nCo-organise with the US National Economic Institute, the International settlement bank(s), and the Business School of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nJuly 15 to 16 days\n\nCo-host with fund organisations, the International Settlement Bank, and the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office.\n\nOctober 14 to 15 days\n\nThe 14th Annual China economic International conference—\"China and worldwide trade structure evolution: Challenge(s) and opportunities\"\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管面對宏觀經濟挑戰及地緣政治的不確定性，香港銀行體系在2024年維持穩健。金管局迅速採取措施支援本地中小型企業，並透過風險為本監管與應變規劃保障銀行體系穩定，另又提供監管指引及支持業界應對新生風險，以提升銀行業的運作穩健性與網絡防衛韌性。為鼓勵應用金融科技，金管局推出連串跨行業項目，包括生成式人工智能「沙盒」。\n\n金管局推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》，以加強銀行消費者保障。我們又推出「智安存」協助存款人有效保護存款，以及有關銀行無抵押消費信貸產品的冷靜期以減低衝動及過度借貸的風險。此外，金管局向銀行提供有關在面向客戶的服務中應用生成式人工智能的指引，又就二手物業買賣交易提供多一種支付安排與業界緊密合作。金管局亦透過發出數碼資產相關活動的指引、優化「跨境理財通」業務試點，以及簡化銷售投資及保險產品程序，提升客戶體驗，並同時確保投資者保障。年內完成個人信貸資料服務全面過渡至「信資通」。\n\n金管局在香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度方面扮演重要角色。透過提高經由反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組交換情報的速度及數量，與2023年相比，情報主導的可疑交易報告增加303%，促使凍結或充公的犯罪得益增加34%。有關促進銀行分享訊息以協助偵測及防止金融罪行的法例修訂的諮詢得到廣泛支持。金管局在4月根據交易監察系統專題審查結果提供指引，以及在9月推出計劃促進業界應用人工智能監察可疑活動。金管局亦與銀行業及香港警務處合作，優化「可疑帳號警示」機制及加強宣傳工作，並就防範、偵測及制止授權支付詐騙向銀行發出指引。\n\n香港在實施包括資本充足及披露等國際監管標準方面取得良好進展。香港存款保障委員會優化了存款保障計劃的多個範疇，以加強對存款人的保障。\n\n為確保處置機制具公信力，金管局實施處置標準，規定銀行須更新與對手方的金融合約，減低處置中的提前終止風險。此外，金管局在制定銀行的首選處置策略、應對處置可行性障礙以確保有足夠財政資源及處置中的運作持續性，以及提升處置執行能力方面均取得顯著進展。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響金融體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。事實上，作為一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，我們有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、減低系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建面對金融危機的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而影響其穩定。\n\n# 2024年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局向一間在香港成立為法團的銀行及一間在香港以外成立為法團的銀行授予銀行牌照。金管局亦核准一間在香港以外的交易商經紀成為貨幣經紀。此外，年內金管局撤銷三間持牌銀行、一間有限制牌照銀行及一間接受存款公司的認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第311至314頁及第320至323頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 檢討銀行三級制\n\n在2024年，金管局完成有關簡化銀行三級制至二級制的公眾諮詢，回應者普遍支持簡化建議。經考慮所收到的意見，金管局就建議提出若干新的關鍵事項，以精簡過渡過程及減少對接受存款公司現有客戶的影響。\n\n# 「虛擬銀行」易名\n\n此外，金管局完成有關「虛擬銀行(Virtual Bank)」易名為「數字銀行(Digital Bank)」的公眾諮詢。易名建議得到廣泛支持，金管局遂於10月修訂法定指引《數字銀行的認可》，有關建議正式生效。\n\n# 數字銀行的檢討\n\n在2024年完成的另一項工作是全面檢討數字銀行，檢討報告已於8月發表。有關檢討顯示數字銀行發展至今已達到在香港引入數字銀行的三項政策目標，即推動金融科技與創新、提供新的客戶體驗，以及促進普及金融。在數字銀行和傳統銀行的多樣化發展下，金管局認為現時數字銀行牌照的數量合適，現階段沒有必要在市場上引入更多新的數字銀行參與者。10月發出的修訂指引《數字銀行的認可》放寬了數項對業界的限制，包括容許數字銀行經營零售銀行業務以外的銀行業務，以及在從客戶體驗與業務策略的角度而言屬合理的情況下設立實體分行，前提是數字銀行繼續主要透過數碼渠道提供銀行服務。\n\n# 銀行牌照費的檢討\n\n金管局於年內完成對牌照費的檢討，並於6月提高費用水平。\n\n# 香港的公司遷冊制度\n\n金管局就於香港引入公司遷冊制度向政府提供支援，包括協助修訂《銀行業條例》及其附屬法例以及其他與金管局有關的法例的立法程序。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n年內金管局共進行174次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治及風險管理。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。此外，金管局對認可機構的各項業務進行現場審查，包括信用、市場及流動性風險管理方面的管治與做法。\n\n鑑於認可機構應用科技的情況越趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。金管局亦進一步加強對認可機構氣候風險管理的監管，以提高認可機構應對氣候變化的能力。金管局在全球經濟不明朗的環境下維持金融穩定及促進經濟穩健增長等方面的工作得到肯定，獲《亞洲銀行家》雜誌(The AsianBanker)評選為「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構」(BestMacroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific)。\n\n助理總裁（銀行監理）朱立翹女士（中）代表金管局領取《亞洲銀行家》雜誌頒發的「亞太區最佳宏觀經濟監管機構獎項\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、信託、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務，以及消費者保障事項進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視新的項目或被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2024年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\na. 聚焦於運作穩健性的額外監管工作包括一項金管局調查及認可機構進行自我評估以審視實施進度和識別需要加強的環節，以及就架構制定與做法在雙邊與業界層面進行廣泛的外展活動。\nb. 此外，監管工作集中評估認可機構對特定信貸組合的審批和持續風險管理的策略與手法，例如對商用物業及中小型企業貸款。\nc. 包括與認可機構舉行諮詢會議，以檢視其實施金管局《監管政策手冊》單元GS-1「氣候風險管理」的情況。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2024年貸款總額減少2.8%，2023年的跌幅為3.6%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2024年內地相關貸款總額減少8.7%至38,590億港元（表3）。\n\n鑑於利率仍然高企、部分內地房地產發展商的債務問題還未完全緩解，以及本地商業房地產市場疲弱，金管局在2024年繼續密切監察認可機構的資產質素及評估其信用風險管理手法。年內銀行體系的資產質素持續面對壓力，但風險形勢仍屬可控。銀行體系的特定分類貸款比率於2024年底為1.96%，高於2023年底的1.57%，而同期內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率則由2.58%下降至2.38%。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，當中重點包括對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款、無抵押零售貸款、對香港境外業務的信用風險的監察，以及對非銀行金融機構的風險承擔。\n\n表

macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, Hong Kong’s banking sector remained resilient in 2024. The HKMA swiftly took measures to support local small and medium-sized enterprises, and through risk-based regulation and contingency planning, ensured the stability of the banking sector, while also providing regulatory guidance and supporting industry practitioners to respond to new risks, to enhance the operational soundness and cyber resilience of the banking industry. To encourage the application of financial technology, the HKMA launched a series of cross-sectoral projects, including a “Sandbox” for Generative Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched the “Protecting Consumers from Scams Charter 2.0” to enhance consumer protection for banking customers. We have also launched “Smart Deposit” to assist depositors in effectively protecting their deposits, as well as a cooling-off period for unsecured consumer credit products to reduce the risk of impulsive and excessive borrowing. In addition, the HKMA provides guidance to banks on applying Generative Artificial Intelligence in customer-facing services, and is working closely with the industry to provide an additional payment arrangement for secondary property transactions. The HKMA also enhances customer experience by issuing guidance on digital asset-related activities, optimising the Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme, and streamlining the procedures for selling investment and insurance products, while ensuring investor protection. The full transition of personal credit reference services to “CreditInfo” will be completed within the year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority plays a key role in Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime. By enhancing the speed and volume of intelligence sharing through the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Intelligence Group, intelligence-led suspicious transaction reporting increased by 303% compared to 2023, leading to a 34% increase in proceeds frozen or confiscated from criminal activity. Consultation on legislative changes to promote banks sharing information to assist in the detection and prevention of financial crime received widespread support. In April, the HKMA provided guidance based on the findings of a targeted review of transaction monitoring systems, and in September launched a Scheme to promote the application of Artificial Intelligence by the industry to monitor suspicious activity. The HKMA also collaborated with the banking sector and the Hong Kong Police Force to enhance the “suspicious account alert” mechanism and strengthen publicity efforts, and issued guidance to banks on preventing, detecting and disrupting authorized payment scams.\n\nHong Kong has made good progress in implementing International regulatory standards including capital adequacy and disclosure etc. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Committee has enhanced various areas of the deposit protection Scheme to strengthen protection for depositors.\n\nTo ensure a credible resolution mechanism, the Monetary Authority implements resolution standards, requiring banks to update financial contracts with counterparties, reducing the risk of early termination during resolution. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in formulating banks’ preferred resolution strategies, responding to barriers to resolvability to ensure adequate financial resources and continued operations during resolution, and enhancing resolution execution capabilities.\n\n# objective\n\nOne of the HKMA’s objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking sector. To achieve this objective, it is essential to developed and maintain a financial system with a high degree of resilience and capable of providing the critical financial services needed for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the financial system due to their operational method(s), or even due to disorderly failure in extreme cases. As a supervisory authority, the Monetary Authority plays an important role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring banks have the resilience to withstand shocks and respond to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failure. The Monetary Authority is responsible for prudential supervision of banks, as well as authorization of licensed banks in Hong Kong, restricted license banks and deposit taking companies (collectively named “authorized institutions”).\n\nHong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime is not designed to ensure “zero risk”. In fact, as a resolution authority, the Monetary Authority seeks to ensure that, should an authorized institution become non-viable, its failure can be resolved in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a corporate resolution mechanism, with the Monetary Authority serving as the resolution authority for authorized institutions under that mechanism. To implement Hong Kong’s resolution mechanism, it is necessary to determine resolution rules and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove barriers to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and build the HKMA’s capabilities to operate the resolution of authorized institutions nearing failure. To effectively carry out the above work, the HKMA adopts methods consistent with and coordinate with international standards.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for designating and monitoring certain financial market infrastructures. The HKMA’s monitoring of financial market infrastructures aims to promote the overall safety and efficiency of the related infrastructures, reduce systemic risks, and enhance transparency. Enhancing the resilience of financial market infrastructures to financial crises can protect Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system(s), and prevent disruptions to their operations from affecting its stability.\n\n# 2024 Year in Review\n\n# License matters.\n\nWithin the year, the HKMA granted banking licenses to a bank established as a corporation in Hong Kong and a bank established as a corporation outside of Hong Kong. The HKMA also approved a broker outside of Hong Kong to become a currency broker. In addition, during the year, the HKMA revoked the authorization of three licensed banks, one bank with restricted licenses, and one deposit-taking company.\n\nFor additional information related to Hong Kong’s authorized institutions and Local offices, See appendices and Table D to F, which are included on pages 311 to 314 and 320 to 323 respectively.\n\n# Reviews of the three-level banking system.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed related Public consultation on streamlining the three-tiered banking system to a two-tiered system, and respondents generally Support the streamlining recommendations. After considering the feedback received, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has put forward several new critical matters regarding the recommendations, in order to achieve streamlining of the transition process and reduce the impact on existing customers of Deposittaking companies.\n\n# \"Virtual banks\" are rebranded.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA completed related public consultation on renaming “Virtual Bank” to “Digital Bank”. The renaming proposal received widespread support, and the HKMA therefore revised the statutory guidance “Authorization of Digital Banks” in Oct, with the related recommendations officially taking effect.\n\n# Reviews of digital banks.\n\nAnother task completed in 2024 was a comprehensive review of digital banks, with the review report published in August. The review shows that the development of digital banks has, to date, achieved the three policy objectives of introducing digital banks in Hong Kong, namely to promote financial technology and innovation, provide new customer experiences, and promote financial inclusion. With the diversified development of both digital banks and traditional banks, the HKMA believes that the current volume of digital bank licenses is appropriate and there is no necessary to introduce additional new digital bank participants into the market at this stage. Amendments to the guidance “Authorization of Digital Banks” issued in October relaxed several restrictions on the industry, including allowing digital banks to operate banking business beyond retail banking, and to establish physical branches where reasonable from the perspective of customer experience and business strategies, provided that digital banks continue to primarily provide banking services through digital channels.\n\n# Reviews of bank license fees.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority completed a review of license fees within the year and increased the costs level in June.\n\n# Hong Kong’s company migration System\n\nThe HKMA provides support to the Government regarding the introduction of a company migration regime in Hong Kong, including assisting with the legislative procedures for amendments to the banking legislation and its subsidiary legislation, as well as other legislation related to the HKMA.\n\n# Regulatory work overview\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA conducted 174 non-site examinations covering a wide scope, including CAMEL assessment of authorized institutions, corporate governance and risk management. To further enhance the risk governance levels of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 36 meetings in total with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors or committees under the boards, and co-chaired 38 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors. In addition, the HKMA conducted on-site examinations of various business tasks of authorized institutions, including governance and practices in credit, market and liquidity risk management.\n\nGiven the increasing prevalence of technology adoption by authorized institutions, risk management of business operations and technology risks is another supervisory priority. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also further strengthened its supervisory work on climate risk management by authorized institutions, to enhance their ability to respond to climate change. The HKMA’s work in maintaining financial stability and promoting robust economic growth amid a global economic uncertain environment has been recognized, and it was selected by *The Asian Banker* magazine as “Best Macroeconomic Regulator in Asia Pacific”.\n\nAssistant Chief Executive (Bank Supervision) Ms. Zhu Liqiao (in) represents the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to receive the “Asia-Pacific Best Macroeconomic Regulatory Institution Award” presented by The Asian Banker magazine.\n\nIn terms of supervisory conduct, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducts on-site examination of the securities, investment products, trusts, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related business of authorized institutions, as well as consumer protection issues, and uses thematic assessments to ensure compliance, to review new projects or areas assessed as high risks.\n\nTable 1 includes a summary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory work in 2024.\n\nTable 1 Regulatory work overview\n\na. Focusing on operational resilience, additional supervisory work includes an investigation by the HKMA and authorization of institutions to conduct self-assessment to review implementation progress and identify areas for improvement, as well as extensive outreach activities at both bilateral and industry levels regarding the development of frameworks and practices.\nb. Furthermore, supervisory work focuses on assessing authorized institutions’ approval and continued risk management strategies and practices for specific credit portfolios, such as those for commercial properties and small and medium-sized enterprise loans.\nc. This includes holding consultation meetings with authorized institutions to review their implementation of the HKMA’s “Supervisory Policy Manual” module GS-1 “Climate Risk Management” situation.\n\n# Credit risks\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality.\n\nIn 2024, the total loan amount decreased by 2.8%, while the decline in 2023 was 3.6%. Table 2 sets out the growth situation of various types of loans and advances. In 2024, the total amount of Mainland-related loans decreased by 8.7% to HK$385.9 billion (Table 3).\n\nGiven that policy rates remain high, debt problems of some Mainland real estate developers have not been fully alleviated, and the local commercial real estate market is soft, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of authorized institutions and assess their credit risk management approaches in 2024. Throughout the year, the asset quality of the banking sector continued to face pressures, but the risk situation remained manageable. The banking sector’s sector-specific classified loan ratio at the end of 2024 was 1.96%, higher than 1.57% at the end of 2023, while the sector-specific classified loan ratio for Mainland-related loans decreased from 2.58% to 2.38% during the same period.\n\nWithin the year, the HKMA conducted a special assessment to review the credit risk management of authorized institutions, with key focuses including exposure to risks in sectors more easily affected, mortgage lending to private banking and wealth management customers, unsecured retail lending, monitoring of credit risks related to business outside Hong Kong, and exposure to risks from non-bank financial institutions.\n\nTable 2 Growth of loans and advances\n\nTable 3 Mainland related loan growth\n\n# Alleviating funding pressures on bank customers.\n\n# Support local SMEs.\n\nSMEs are a cornerstone of the Hong Kong economy, and the HKMA has been closely monitoring their access to bank financing. Since the HKMA and the banking sector established the “banking sector SMEs loan coordination mechanism” (SME coordination mechanism) in 2019, a total of multiple rounds of support measures for SMEs have been launched, including the “pre-approved principal repayment holiday scheme”, to assist SMEs through the difficulties during the COVID-19 period.\n\nIn 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector launched additional measures to support SMEs whose operating situation remains challenged by economic transformation, and to assist SMEs to continue to develop and upgrade their transformation.\n\n# New support measures for SMEs.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched nine initiatives through the SME coordination mechanism in March to assist SMEs in obtaining bank financing and support their continued development.\n\nThe nine initiatives to support SMEs announced in March.\n\n1. No requirement for mortgage customers to make early repayments on scheduled installments.\n2. Adjust credit amounts and provide customers with a minimum transition period of six months.\n"}

香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n金管局於2024年在加強香港作為具全球競爭力的國際金融中心的地位方面取得重要進展。\n\n金管局與內地及香港有關當局合作，推出一系列措施，共同深化及擴展香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通，包括優化「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」；擴大金管局人民幣流動資金安排及「北向互換通」的合資格抵押品範圍；優化「北向互換通」；以及優化一級流動性提供行安排。這些措施有助強化香港的門戶角色，並鞏固其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位\n\n金管局在鞏固香港金融平台的競爭力方面亦取得良好進展，涵蓋債券發行、資產及財富管理、綠色和可持續金融，以及企業財資中心等範疇。為宣傳香港的金融服務，金管局加強面向海外及內地持份者的市場推廣工作，讓大家充分認識香港金融體系的穩健及其帶來的機遇。第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」及多項其他盛事成功舉辦，不僅有助提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的形象，更製造正面的漣漪效應。金管局積極參與多個國際及區內的央行及監管組織，繼續對維持金融穩定及促進金融市場發展的全球工作作出貢獻。\n\n金管局在「金融科技2025」 策略的各個範疇均取得顯著進展，包括央行數碼貨幣及數據基建。\n\n快速支付系統「轉數快」的登記數目及交易量繼續穩步增長，於2024年底達到1,580萬個登記，全年平均每日處理港元即時交易增至165萬宗。金管局正與中國人民銀行緊密合作，推動落實香港「轉數快」與內地網上支付跨行清算系統互聯，實現跨境支付。\n\n# 概覽\n\n在2024年，金管局繼續致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n金管局擴展及優化香港與內地間的互聯互通機制，有助鞏固香港作為內地與國際金融市場間的橋樑角色。年內，多項有關「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（「跨境理財通」）的優化措施出台，便利粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）個人投資者進行跨境投資。於2月，金管局將中華人民共和國財政部（國家財政部）發行的在岸國債和內地政策性銀行發行的政策性金融債納入人民幣流動資金安排的合資格抵押品名單。於7月，兩地相關部門公布進一步支持境外投資者使用通過「債券通」持有的在岸債券作為「北向互換通」交易的履約抵押品，並於2025年1月實施。此外，「北向互換通」於年內進行優化，增加投資者在對沖策略和管理投資組合方面的靈活性及效率。\n\n在2024年，香港的離岸人民幣業務穩健增長。金管局推出一級流動性提供行安排的優化措施，包括增加提供行數目及擴大安排規模。於年底前，香港人民幣即時支付結算系統的夜間跨境服務能力提升，以更好應付全球各地對跨境人民幣支付的需要。\n\n金管局推出大灣區金融合作下的多項利民便商措施，包括促進企業跨境融資的跨境徵信互通業務試點，以及便利香港居民在大灣區置業的跨境匯款支付安排。\n\n金管局繼續致力提升香港整體金融平台的競爭力。具體而言，為增強香港作為首選基金管理中心及家族辦公室業務樞紐的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業緊密合作，締造更便利的稅務及監管環境。此外，金管局透過Evergreen項目發行第二批代幣化債券，並推出「EvergreenHub」一站式數碼債券知識庫和「數碼債券資助計劃」，繼續推動香港債券市場創新。於10月，金管局公布「可持續金融行動計劃」，訂明進一步鞏固香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融樞紐的具體目標。\n\n另一方面，金管局繼續加強市場拓展工作，向海外及內地持份者介紹香港的金融服務。金管局在11月舉辦第三屆「國際金融領袖投資峰會」。峰會為期三日，主題為「在變局中前航」，雲集全球各地金融業界翹楚分享各自獨到的觀點。峰會先由國務院副總理何立峰先生作開幕主題演講，接着是三間內地金融監管機構的分享環節，以及由國際金融領袖參與的專題討論。峰會共匯聚350多位來自超過120間國際金融機構的領袖參與，充分體現國際金融界對香港的支持和信心。\n\n年內金管局亦舉辦各項其他研討會及會議，包括：\n\n- 於9月與迪拜金融服務管理局合辦聯合氣候金融會議；\n- 於10月與全球風險管理專業人士協會合辦第15屆全球風險論壇；\n- 於10月亦與國際結算銀行合辦國際金融研討會；及\n- 於12月舉辦金融穩定理事會全體會議，是自2016年以來首次在亞洲舉行的同類會議，匯聚超過50個國家財政金融機關及12個國際標準制定機構的領袖和高級官員。\n\n年內金管局亦積極加強與其他地區的雙邊聯繫。於12月，金管局分別與阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）及沙特中央銀行（沙特央行）在香港舉行雙邊會議，促進中東與亞洲地區之間的投資及金融市場聯繫。金管局與阿聯酋央行簽署諒解備忘錄，建立兩地債務資本市場基建的互聯互通，並促進跨境債務證券發行及投資活動。在此之前，金管局於10月訪問卡塔爾多哈，加強兩地金融服務領域的合作。\n\n此外，金管局於12月舉行第七次香港與瑞士金融合作對話，討論內容涵蓋區內及本地的前景與政策挑戰，以及可持續金融、金融科技與市場互聯互通領域的最新發展及潛在合作空間。\n\n金管局分別於1月及5月訪問泰國和馬來西亞，與中央銀行、金融機構和企業會面，推廣香港作為國際金融中心的地位，並進一步加強雙邊金融聯繫和合作。重點領域之一是推廣使用人民幣和本地貨幣作跨境投資和貿易結算，以及香港的競爭優勢。\n\n在國際層面，金管局積極參與中央銀行領域的事務，並繼續在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。金管局現為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組和金融穩定理事會轄下亞洲區域諮詢小組的聯席主席，另又擔任金融穩定理事會轄下金融創新網絡聯席主席（至2024年7月止）。金管局亦為國際結算銀行轄下主要新興市場經濟體行長會議和金融穩定理事會轄下加密資產框架同業評審小組的主席。在2018至2024年間，金管局一直連任東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室與各銀行部門繼續實施「金融科技2025」策略，促進業界廣泛採用金融科技，並提升香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。年內推行的主要措施包括：\n\n- 進一步推動銀行在五個主要範疇的金融科技應用，包括財富科技、保險科技、綠色科技、人工智能及分布式分類帳技術；\n- 推動央行數碼貨幣的工作，以了解其效益及潛在的應用場景，包括：\n    - 推進「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目，以改善跨境支付；\n    - 進一步研究在香港發行「數碼港元」(e-HKD)的可行性；及\n    - 開始探索以央行數碼貨幣支持香港代幣化市場的發展；\n- 透過「商業數據通」便利中小企借貸；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；及\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」。\n\n「轉數快」的使用在2024年繼續增加，登記數目與交易量在過去六年穩步上升。截至2024年底，「轉數快」登記數目增至1,580萬個，全年每日平均交易宗數較上年上升33%。除個人對個人支付及商業支付穩步增長外，透過「轉數快」繳付政府帳單、支付予商戶及為儲值支付工具電子錢包或銀行帳戶增值持續增加，是帶動「轉數快」交易量持續增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）監察六個指定零售支付系統，並監管15項持牌儲值支付工具（其中四項由持牌銀行發行）。年內金管局繼續與業界緊密合作，因應詐騙風險上升加強管控措施及保障消費者。\n\n財經事務及庫務局與金管局就在香港實施穩定幣發行人監管制度的立法建議，於2月完成為期兩個月的公眾諮詢後，於7月聯合發表諮詢總結，並於12月將《穩定幣條例草案》提交立法會審議。為更了解穩定幣發行人的業務模式，並制定適切的監管制度，金管局亦推出穩定幣發行人「沙盒」，並於7月公布三間進入「沙盒」的參與機構。與此同時，金管局繼續積極參與國際組織在數碼資產相關課題（包括穩定幣及代幣化）的工作，確保相關監管框架符合國際標準及最佳做法。\n\n#

status\n\nThe HKMA has made significant progress in 2024 in strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a global financial centre.\n\nThe HKMA, together with related authorities in the Mainland and Hong Kong, has launched a range of measures to jointly deepen and expand connectivity between Hong Kong and the Mainland’s financial markets, including enhancements to the “Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect”; expanding the scope of eligible collateral under the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity arrangements and the “Northbound Bond Connect”; optimising the “Northbound Bond Connect”; and enhancing Primary liquidity providing arrangements. These measures help reinforce Hong Kong’s gateway role and underpin its status as a global hub for offshore renminbi business.\n\nThe HKMA has also made good progress in consolidating Hong Kong’s financial centre’s competitiveness, covering bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and corporate treasury centres, among other areas. To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA has strengthened its market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders, ensuring they have a full understanding of the soundness of Hong Kong’s financial system and the opportunities it brings. The third edition of the ‘Investment Summit’ and various other major events were successfully held, not only helping to enhance Hong Kong’s image as a leading international financial centre, but also creating a positive ripple effect. The HKMA actively participates in various international and regional central banks and regulatory organisations, continuing to contribute to the global work of maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market development.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in all areas of the “Financial Tech 2025” strategy, including central bank digital currency and data infrastructure.\n\nThe Faster Payment System “Faster Payment” registration numbers and turnover continued to grow steadily, reaching 15.8 million registrations at the end of 2024, with the Average daily handling of Hong Kong dollar real-time transactions increasing to 1.65 million items for the whole year. The HKMA is currently working closely with the People’s Bank of China to promote the implementation of the linkage between the Hong Kong “Faster Payment” and the Mainland cross-border bank-to-bank clearing system, achieving cross-border Payment.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn 2024, the HKMA continues its efforts to enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an International Financial Centre.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has expanded and enhanced the connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the Mainland, which helps to consolidate Hong Kong’s role as a bridge between the Mainland and international financial markets. Throughout the year, a number of enhancements to the “Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Wealth Management Connect” ( “WMC”) were implemented, facilitating cross-border investment for individual investors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area). In February, the HKMA included onshore national debt issued by the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China and policy financial debt issued by Mainland policy banks in the list of eligible collateral under the RMB Liquidity arrangements. In July, relevant departments on both sides announced further support for offshore investors to use onshore bonds held through “Bond Connect” as collateral for “Northbound Swap Connect” transactions, to be implemented in January 2025. In addition, “Northbound Swap Connect” underwent enhancements during the year, increasing the agility and efficiency of investors in hedging strategies and managing investment portfolios.\n\nIn 2024, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi business grew robustly. The HKMA launched enhancements to the Primary Liquidity Providing Facility arrangements, including increasing the number of providing institutions and expanding the facility size. Before the end of the year, the resilience of Hong Kong’s real-time gross settlement system for overnight cross-border payments will be enhanced to better meet the demand for cross-border renminbi payments worldwide.\n\nThe HKMA launched a number of facilitative measures under Financial cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, including a pilot scheme for cross-boundary credit information exchange to promote cross-border financing for enterprises, and arrangements facilitating payments for Hong Kong residents buying properties in the Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe HKMA continues to strive to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s overall financial platform. Specifically, to strengthen Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund Management Centre and family office business hub, the HKMA is working closely with the Government and the financial sector to create a more facilitated tax and regulatory environment. In addition, the HKMA is continuing to promote innovation in the Hong Kong bond market by issuing the second batch of tokenized bonds through the Evergreen project and launching the “EvergreenHub” one-stop digital bond knowledge repository and the “Digital Bond Funding Scheme”. In Oct, the HKMA announced the “Sustainable Finance Action Plan”, provides specific objectives for further consolidating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub.\n\nOn the other hand, the HKMA continues to strengthen market expansion work, to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and the Mainland stakeholders. The HKMA held the third Investment Summit in Nov, which lasts three days, with the theme of “Sailing Ahead Amidst Change”, bringing together leaders from the global financial community to share their unique perspectives. The summit began with an opening keynote speech by Vice Premier He Lifeng, followed by sharing sessions from three Mainland financial regulatory agencies, and a special discussion with International leaders. The summit gathered more than 350 leaders from over 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrated the support and confidence of the international financial community for Hong Kong.\n\nWithin the year, the HKMA also held various other workshops and meetings, including:\n\n- Co-organise a Joint Climate Finance Conference with the Dubai International Financial Centre in Sep;\n- Co-host the 15th Global Risk Forum with the Global Association of Risk Professionals in Oct;\n- Also organise an International Financial seminar with the Bank for International Settlements in Oct; and\n- Hold a plenary meeting of the Financial Stability Board in Dec, which is the first such meeting held in Asia since 2016, bringing together leaders and senior officials from financial authorities of more than 50 countries and 12 international standards-setting institutions.\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA also actively strengthened bilateral linkages with other regions. In December, the HKMA held bilateral meetings in Hong Kong with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (the UAE Central Bank) and the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA), to promote investment and Financial Market connectivity between the Middle East and Asia regions. The HKMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UAE Central Bank to developed cross-border debt capital markets Infrastructure, and promote cross-border debt Securities issuance and investment activities. Prior to this, in October, the HKMA visited Doha, Qatar, to strengthen cooperation in the two jurisdictions’ financial services areas.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA held the seventh Hong Kong-Switzerland Financial collaboration dialogue in December, with discussions covering regional and local prospects and policy challenges, as well as the latest developments and potential collaboration space in sustainable finance, financial technology and market connectivity.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority sent representatives to Thailand and Malaysia for interviews in Jan and 5, meeting with central banks, financial institutions and enterprises to promote Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, and to further strengthen bilateral financial links and co-operation. A key area of focus is the promotion of using Renminbi and local currency for cross-border investment and trade settlement, as well as Hong Kong’s competitive advantages.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA actively participates in central banking affairs and continues to play a leadership role in various regional and international committees. The HKMA currently co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Asia Regional Consultative Group under the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and also serves as co-chair of the FSB’s Innovative Use Cases Taskforce (until July 2024). The HKMA also chairs the meetings of Governors of Major Emerging Market Economies under the Bank for International Settlements and the Peer Review Group for Crypto-asset Frameworks under the FSB. From 2018 to 2024, the HKMA has consistently served as Chairman of the Financial Market Workstream under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks Group (EMEAP).\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Financial Technology Promotion Office and various bank departments continue implementing the “Financial Technology 2025” strategy, promote the widespread adoption of financial technology within the industry, and enhance Hong Kong’s status as a financial technology hub in Asia. Key measures to be implemented within the year include:\n\n- Further promote banking application of financial technology in five key areas, including wealth tech, insurance tech, green technology, Artificial Intelligence and distributed ledger technology;\n- Drive work relating to central bank digital currency to understand its benefits and potential use cases, including:\n    - Advancing the “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Cross-border Network” (mBridge) project to improve cross-border payments;\n    - Further study the resolvability of issuing “Digital Hong Kong dollar” (e-HKD) in Hong Kong; and\n    - Begin to explore supporting the development of a tokenized market in Hong Kong with central bank digital currency;\n- Facilitate borrowing for SMEs through “Commercial Data Interchange”;\n- Strengthen cross-border financial technology cooperation; and\n- Promote wider use of the Faster Payment System “Faster Payment”.\n\n“Faster Payment System” usage continued to increase in 2024, with the number of registrations and turnover steadily growing over the past six years. As at the end of 2024, the number of “Faster Payment System” registrations increased to 15.8 million, and the average daily number of transactions for the whole year grew by 33% compared to the previous year. In addition to stable growth in person-to-person payments and Commercial payments, continued increases were seen in using “Faster Payment System” to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up electronic wallets or bank accounts, which are the main reasons driving the continued growth in “Faster Payment System” turnover.\n\nTo ensure the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) monitors six specified retail payment systems under the “Payment Systems and Stored Value Facility Ordinance” (“Payment Ordinance”) and regulates 15 licensed Stored Value Facility (SVF) tools (among which four main are issued by licensed banks). During the year, the HKMA continued to collaborate closely with the industry, following the increasing fraud risks by strengthening supervisory measures and protecting consumers.\n\nThe Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly published a consultation summary in July, following the completion of a two-month public consultation in February, on legislative proposals for the supervisory and regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong, and submitted the “Stablecoins Ordinance Draft” to the Legislative Council for deliberation in December. To further understand the business models of stablecoin issuers and to develop appropriate supervisory arrangements, the HKMA also launched a stablecoin issuer “Sandbox” and announced three participating institutions entering the “Sandbox” in July. At the same time, the HKMA continues to actively participate in the work of international organisations on issues related to digital assets (including stablecoins and tokenisation), ensuring that the relevant regulatory framework meets international standards and best practices.\n\n# The HKMA’s overview of measures to enhance Hong Kong’s international financial centre competitiveness in 2024.\n\nDeepen Hong Kong’s financial market connectivity with the Mainland to consolidate Hong Kong’s role as a hub for offshore renminbi business and strengthen links within the region.\n\n- Enhance “Wealth Management Connect” and “Northbound Bond Connect”\n- Expand the scope of eligible collateral under the HKMA’s RMB Liquidity Arrangement and “Northbound Bond Connect” to include onshore RMB bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and Mainland policy banks.\n- Enhance Primary Liquidity Providing arrangements.\n- Enhance the overnight cross-border service capabilities of Hong Kong’s RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement system to better meet the demand for cross-border RMB payments globally.\n- Provide support for bond issuance in Hong Kong by the Shenzhen Municipal Government, Guangdong Provincial Government, and Hainan Provincial Government.\n- Facilitate cross-border financing for corporates through cross-border credit information exchange and cooperation.\n- Implement facilitative measures for cross-border remittances for property purchases in the Greater Bay Area.\n- Deepen engagement and communications between relevant Mainland institutions and the Hong Kong financial sector, and capture business opportunities.\n\n# Strengthen contacts with the global community.\n\n- To hold a series of international events: the Investment Summit, the plenary meeting of the Financial Stability Board, and a workshop co-organised with the Bank for International Settlements.\n- To strengthen market expansion work, promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and the Mainland stakeholders, and lay a solid foundation for cooperation with the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regions.\n- To actively participate in international and regional central banks and supervisory organisations.\n\n# Enhance financial platform competitiveness.\n\nThrough the Evergreen project to promote bond market innovation, including assisting the government in issuing the world’s first multi-currency digital bonds and launching a one-stop digital bond knowledge repository “EvergreenHub,” and also launching the “Digital Bond Funding Scheme.”\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。主要經濟體錄得穩定增長，而通脹亦回落至更接近政策目標的水平。多個主要央行陸續下調政策利率，有利投資環境。2024年全年計，外匯基金錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，投資回報率為5.2%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子，其存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，利率視乎實際資產配置而定。於2024年，投資組合與長期增長組合在未來基金的目標資產配置約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括環球定息市場投資，並透過不同的衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取外聘投資經理的市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，穩健的風險管理更見重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並設置風險管理程序，為策略性規劃及多元化投資工作提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信適度強調負責任投資及投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。為積極支持負責任投資，金管局已將ESG因素融入外匯基金的投資管理過程中，其指導性原則是：當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見《二零二四年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2024年的金融市場\n\n2024年環球金融市場表現大致良好。\n\n主要股票市場於2024年升幅顯著，當中美國股市在經濟和通脹基調大致向好和人工智能熱潮背景下，首三季升幅尤其突出。不過第4季市況因憂慮通脹升溫及債息上升等而變得波動並從高位回落，投資者亦轉趨審慎。內地和香港股市方面，受惠於中央在第3季出台的一系列刺激經濟和股市的政策措施，投資者信心有所好轉。然而市場認為實體經濟增長依然不明朗的情況下，兩地股市於第4季回軟。\n\n環球債券市場在2024年的表現亦有較大波動。儘管主要央行大致確立減息的大方向，但減息的節奏和幅度年內出現多次轉變。及至第4季，市場開始注視美國2025年的財政政策，美國國債收益率季內大幅上升，債價受壓。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣於2024年，特別是第4季，因為息口走勢和美國經濟表現相對強勁而走強。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2024年的表現。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2024年錄得2,188億港元的投資收入，其中包括：\n\n- 債券投資收益1,359億港元；\n- 股票投資收益909億港元（其中香港股票投資收益218億港元，其他股票的投資收益691億港元）；\n- 非港元資產外匯估值下調356億港元；及\n- 外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益276億港元。\n\n另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得28億港元估值收益。\n\n於2024年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,810億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為5,412億港元，其中私募股權為4,348億港元，房地產為1,064億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,886億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2024年的投資回報率為5.2%，其中投資組合的回報率為7.2%，支持組合為4.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2024年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2024年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2022至2024年的平均回報率為2.0%、2020至2024年為3.1%、2015至2024年為3.1%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2024年12月31日的貨幣比重。詳情參閱第203至309頁外匯基金的經審計2024年度財務報表。\n\n圖1

financial markets performed generally well. Major economies recorded stable growth, and inflation also retreated to levels closer to policy objectives. Several major central banks successively lowered policy rates, which was favorable to the investment environment. For the year as a whole in 2024, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion, with a rate of return of 5.2%.\n\n# External Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly affect the Hong Kong dollar exchange value, and may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system(s), with a view to maintaining Hong Kong’s position as an International financial centre. The HKMA is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the deployment and investment management of the Exchange Fund, based on the powers delegated by the Financial Secretary and the provisions for delegations of powers.\n\n# External Exchange Fund Management\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee formulates the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) Protect capital;\n(ii) ensures the overall currency foundation is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets at all times;\n(iii) ensures sufficient funds for maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) seeks to maximize investment return, to the extent possible under the above (i) to (iii), for safeguarding the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe above objectives fully address the statutory purpose of the Exchange Fund and have already been reflected in the portfolio structure and target asset allocation of the Exchange Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Exchange Fund’s Portfolio\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: a Support Portfolio and an Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing fully Support for the monetary foundation as required by the monetary authority System. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and stock markets of economies that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in order to protect the value and long-term purchasing power of the asset(s).\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the HKMA is prudently and incrementally allocating a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets to more diversified asset classes, including emerging markets and the Mainland’s bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure) and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The target asset allocation of the long-term growth portfolio, along with the allocation of other asset classes, is determined in accordance with prudent risk management principles and a diversified asset portfolio strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government for strategic purposes as part of the Exchange Fund accounts. Due to the unique nature of this Portfolio, its performance is not included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund’s investments.\n\n# In the Exchange Fund’s deposits.\n\nThe Exchange Fund takes deposits from fiscal Reserves, Government Fund and statutory bodies from time to time, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, but in the future the Fund is a major individual example, with the interest rate on its deposits linked to the investment portfolio and long-term growth portfolio return, and the interest rate depends on the actual asset allocation. In 2024, the investment portfolio and long-term growth portfolio accounted for about 35:65 of the target asset allocation for the future Fund.\n\n# Investment procedures\n\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected as an investment benchmark, meaning the long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as guidance and, through tactical asset allocation, seeks to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation—that is, the strategic allocation—and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is known as “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consultation with the Advisory Committee, formulates the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorised to determine the strategic asset allocation and set the allowable scope of tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage their positions within the allowable range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market changing.\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Exchange Fund Investment Office is specifically responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. Staff of the office are responsible for directly managing around 70% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and part of the portfolio. This internally managed portfolio includes global fixed-income market investments, and through different derivative tools, executes the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy.\n\n# External investment manager\n\nBesides managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also employs external investment managers responsible for managing approximately 30% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special asset classes. The primary purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment talent in the market for Exchange Fund investments, to effect sustainable return, and to allow the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment method(s), as well as to learn from the external investment managers’ market experience and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to employing external investment managers include fund management and depository fees, transaction fees, withholding taxes and other taxes. These expenses are mainly affected by market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, making robust risk management even more important. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides stringent controls and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and established rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has three lines of defense for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority regularly monitors major investment risk categories (including credit, Market, liquidity, and operational risks), and implements risk management procedures, providing a resilient framework for strategic planning and diversified investment tasks.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA believes that appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and the sustainable long-term performance of investments can more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce the environmental, social and governance (ESG) related risks involving investment activities. To actively support responsible investment, the HKMA has already integrated ESG factors into the investment management process of the Exchange Fund, with its guiding principles being: when the risk-adjusted long-term gains of ESG investments are similar to those of other investment projects, ESG investments will generally be prioritized. See chapter “Responsible Investment” of the “2024 Sustainable Development Report” for further information regarding the HKMA’s work in responsible investment.\n\n# The performance of the foreign exchange Fund.\n\n# The financial markets in 2024.\n\n2024 global financial markets performance was generally good.\n\nMajor stock markets increased significantly in 2024, with the US stock market experiencing particularly robust growth in the first three quarters amid a generally positive economic and inflation outlook and the Artificial Intelligence boom. However, market conditions became volatile and retreated from their highs in the fourth quarter due to concerns over rising inflation and increasing interest rates, and investors also turned prudent. Regarding the Mainland and Hong Kong stock markets, investor confidence improved, driven by a range of economic and stock market stimulus policy measures implemented by the Central government in the third quarter. However, with the market believing that economic growth remained uncertain, the two jurisdictions’ stock markets softened in the fourth quarter.\n\nGlobal bond markets experienced substantial volatility in 2024. Although major central banks largely established a general policy direction of interest rate cuts, the pace and magnitude of these cuts changed multiple times throughout the year. By the 4th quarter, the market began to focus on US fiscal policy in 2025, and US bond yields surged by 23.5% during the quarter, putting pressure on bond prices.\n\nIn the monetary market, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to interest rate trends and the relatively strong economic performance of the United States.\n\nTable 1 sets out the performance of major currencies, debt markets, and stock markets in 2024.\n\n# The performance of the foreign exchange Fund.\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$218.8 billion in 2024, including:\n\n- Bond investments gains 135.9 billion Hong Kong dollars;\n- Stock investments gains 90.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (of which gains from investments in Hong Kong stocks were 21.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, and gains from investments in other stocks were 69.1 billion Hong Kong dollars);\n- The exchange value of non-Hong Kong dollar assets was lowered by 35.6 billion Hong Kong dollars; and\n- Gains from other investments held by Exchange Fund investment-related subsidiaries were 27.6 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nOn the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded gains of 28 billion Hong Kong dollars in value.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the total value of the Exchange Fund’s assets reached HK$408.10 billion. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments was HK$541.2 billion, of which private equity was HK$434.8 billion and real estate was HK$106.4 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn down for investment within the long-term growth portfolio was HK$288.6 billion.\n\nThe Exchange Fund (excluding strategic portfolios) achieved a rate of return of 5.2% on its investments in 2024, with the portfolio’s rate of return at 7.2% and Support at 4.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has provided an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2% since its inception in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 sets out the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2024. Table 2 shows the investment rate of return of the Exchange Fund in 2024 and the average investment rate of return for different periods. The average rate of return of the Exchange Fund for the years 2022 to 2024 was 2.0%, for 2020 to 2024 was 3.1%, for 2015 to 2024 was 3.1%, and 4.5% since 1994. Table 3 lists the currency composition of the Exchange Fund’s assets as at December 31, 2024. For details, see the audited financial statements of the Exchange Fund for the annual 2024 on pages 203 to 309.\n\nFigure 1 Exchange Fund investment rate of return (1994 to 2024 year)\n"}

The effectiveness of the cross-media promotion activities has been recognized, achieving international promotion honors.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Nguyen Quoc Heng (right) participated in performing the anti-fraud song.\n\nCross-media publicity activities strengthen public awareness of fraud prevention.\n\n# \"Cross-border financial new opportunities\" video series.\n\nThe HKMA and a local video provider jointly created a series of video shorts, “New Opportunities in Cross-boundary Wealth Management,” to assist the public in further understanding the opportunities and facilitated access that the “Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Wealth Management Connect” (“WMC”) brings to retail investors in cross-boundary investments. This series of video shorts uses “classic scenes” from five well-known Hong Kong-produced films to explain the framework of the “WMC,” investor eligibility requirements, the products offered by “Northbound Bond Connect” and “Southbound” access, risk management, and issues to note when making cross-boundary investments, and will be promoted through video, Digital media and social platforms.\n\nThe short video introduces “Wealth Management Connect” in a humorous and engaging way.\n\n# Hong Kong Financial Championship\n\nTo enhance students’ financial knowledge, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is collaborating with various related institutions to hold the “Hong Kong-wide Financial Literacy Championship”. The activity enters its tenth year in 2024, with the theme of “Future Financial Talent”, aiming to enable students to learn about innovations, financial technology, Artificial Intelligence and other developments and future trends, and to promote students upholding sustainable development and environmental, social and governance principles.\n\nThe first part of the Championship is an online quiz, testing students’ financial knowledge and understanding of popular financial topics.

The second part of the Championship, the “Young Financial Talent Scheme,” is conducted in a mentorship form, with senior practitioners from different areas serving as mentors to train students to participate in the “Design Thinking Challenge.” In 2024, this part of the Championship further added a “Greater Bay Area Invitational,” to promote engagement among students in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive Chen Wei-min delivered a welcome address at the Championship final, and as encouragement to the final contestants.\n\nStudents participating in the \"Youth Financial Talent Plan\" will meet with their mentors.\n\n# Board education game\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched its first financial education board game, “$mart理財321”, in 2023 and continued promotion in 2024, allowing more persons to become familiar with this original board game and strengthening its purpose as an education tool, enabling primary school students to understand different payment methods, basic financial concepts, financial technology and cyber security in a simulation scenario.\n\nAt the community level, we set up a booth at the “Hong Kong Book Fair 2024” and organised workshops in the community during Christmas and the Lunar New Year, as well as held parent-child workshops at the HKMA offices, to further promote financial and money management concepts. In addition, we arranged activities at primary schools to allow primary school students to try the board game, and held training workshops to encourage secondary school teachers to use board games as one of the teaching materials in the newly established junior secondary subject “Civic, Economic and Social Studies”’ financial education module. The board game has been recognised by the Education Bureau as one of the outstanding teaching tools and was used as prizes for winning schools in its “Financial Education School Award Scheme” (2023\/24). The HKMA held a total of about 40 board game workshops in 2024, with participation from over 3,600 students, parents, teachers and social workers.\n\nBased on the experience of developing the \"$mart manage finances 321\" board game, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the strategic board game \"Corporate Green Transformation\" and distributed it as a souvenir at the \"Hong Kong Book Fair 2024\" booth. This is the first board game in Hong Kong to convey green financial knowledge to students.\n\nFurthermore, we continue to support the work of the investors and financial education committee, enhance the financial knowledge and money management abilities of Hong Kong residents, and will study further collaboration with different stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community participation efforts.\n\nThrough board game activities, we promote financial education to teachers, students, and parents.\n\n# Financial disclosures\n\nTo maintain high transparency, the HKMA adopts International Financial Disclosure Standards applicable to central bank operations, including Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the International Monetary Fund’s Data Template on Financial Access. The accounting department, with assistance from independent auditors and other professional accounting staff, prepares the Exchange Fund financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.

億港元。\n\n86%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘14%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共5,522.51億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金 融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2024年12月31日共值211.32億港元。集團亦於聯營公司及合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2024年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告會計準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n\n-計劃並執行集團審計，以就集團中實體或業務單位的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，作為對財務報表形成意見的基礎。我負責指導、監督和審視為進行集團審計而履行的審計工作。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（除特別註明外，所有金額均以港幣百萬元位列示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註31。\n","terms":{"企業":["corporate(s)","corporations","enterprises","corporate","enterprise","companies","entity","entities","corporates"],"市場":["market","markets","Market"],"因衝動":["impulsive"],"償還":["repayment","repay"],"特定":["sector-specific","classified"],"提升":["enhance","enhancing","promote","further

Report\nExternal Fund financial statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Report from the Independent Auditor to the Financial Secretary\n\n# opinion\n\nI hereby certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 209 to 309, which financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2024, and the income and expenditure account, comprehensive income statement, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended that date, as well as the notes to the financial statements, including data on significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that these financial reports have already been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Association of Accountants and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the group as at December 31, 2024, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended that date, and have already been prepared in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The foundation of opinion.\n\nI have already conducted the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the audit Standards of the Auditor's. My responsibilities under those Standards are set out in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report” section of this Report. In accordance with those Standards, I am independent of the group, and have already fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a foundation for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nCritical audit matters are those matters determined by my professional judgment to be of most importance to the audit of the financial statements for the year ended Dec 31, 2024. I addressed these matters in the course of my audit and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Fair value accounting for financial assets and financial liabilities valuation.\n\nSee financial table note 2.5, 2.6 and 37.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Group’s financial assets at fair value totaled 39,151.17 billion Hong Kong dollars, and financial liabilities totaled 13,862.99 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\n86% of these Financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are valued at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation methods with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 14% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation method(s), and the inputs used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). The total value of these financial assets is HK$552.251 billion, including non-listed investment fund(s) etc..\n\nGiven the large amount involved and the estimation, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a critical audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\nUnderstand different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities’ valuation procedures, including related controls.\n\nAssessment and testing of control measures, including related application monitoring measures for computer systems;\n\nObtaining confirmation letters regarding the valuation, existence, control, and responsibilities and integrity of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\nIf using Market prices, verify the prices according to independent sources;\n\nIf the inputs used in the valuation method are based on observable market data, assess whether the valuation method is appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the inputs according to independent sources; and\n\nIf the inputs used in the valuation method are not based on observable market data, assess whether the valuation method is appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and inputs are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties measured at fair value.\n\nSee financial statements note 2.11, 17 and 18.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value, and were valued at a total of HK$21.132 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Group also held powers in associated companies and joint ventures, whose principal business is the holding of overseas investment properties. Whether held directly by the Group or by associated companies or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is primarily determined based on the estimation by independent professional valuers. These estimations involve significant judgment and estimation, including the valuation method(s) and assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures for the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\n\nTo effect and review valuation reports of investment properties held directly by the Group or held by associated companies or joint ventures, and to verify that fair value is determined based on the valuations listed in the related valuation reports.\n\nAssess the independence and qualifications of the valuer; and\n\nAssess whether the valuation method is appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and inputs are reasonable.\n\n# Other data\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for other data. Other data includes all information in the Monetary Authority’s 2024 annual Report, but does not include financial reports and my auditor's Report.\n\nMy opinion regarding the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not publish any form of assurance conclusions regarding other information.\n\nRegarding the audit of the financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other data to consider whether the other data has a material contradiction with the financial statements or the situation I learned during the audit process, or appears to have a material misstatement. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe the other data has a material misstatement, I need to report that fact. In this regard, I have no reporting.\n\n# The Monetary Authority and Advisory Committee on Exchange Fund’s audits committee shall bear the responsibility for financial statements.\n\nThe Monetary Authority shall be responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Association of certified public accountant(s) and the directions provided by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the Monetary Authority shall be responsible to assess the Group’s continued viability, and where applicable, disclose matters related to continued viability, and use continued viability as the accounting foundation.\n\nThe Advisory Committee under the Exchange Fund is responsible for the supervision of the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The auditor's responsibilities regarding the audit of financial statements.\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the overall financial reports are free from material misstatement caused by fraud or error, and to provide an auditor's report including my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high standard of assurance, but it cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing Standards will always detect any material misstatement that exists. A misstatement can arise from fraud or error and is considered material if it is reasonably expected to affect economic decisions made by users of the financial reports, either individually or in aggregate.\n\nIn the process of conducting an audit in accordance with the audit Standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and implement audit procedures to respond to those risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as the foundation for my opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of failing to detect material misstatements resulting from fraud is highly greater than the risk of failing to detect those resulting from error.\n\nTo understand and appreciate internal controls related to the audit, in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not designed to publish opinions on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n\nAssess whether the accounting policies adopted by the Monetary Authority are appropriate, and whether the accounting estimates made and related data disclosures are reasonable.\n\nDetermining whether the practices adopted by the Monetary Authority to assess ongoing viability as the accounting foundation are appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determining whether there is material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw users’ attention to relevant disclosures in the financial reports within the auditor's report. Should the related disclosures be insufficient, I shall issue an auditor's report with a qualified opinion. My conclusion is based on audit evidence obtained as at the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or situations may lead to the Group being unable to continue operating.\n\nAssessment of the overall presentation, structure and content of financial statements, including disclosure of information, and whether the financial statements fairly represent transactions and matters; and\n\nPlan and execute the Group audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial data of entities or business units within the Group, as a foundation for forming an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for guidance, supervision, and review of the audit work performed to carry out the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s under Audit Committee regarding the audit scope and time of the Scheme, as well as significant audit findings etc., including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identify during the year.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, explain that I have met the relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that could reasonably be seen as affecting my independence, as well as related mitigating strategies where applicable.\n\nFrom matters communicated with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Committee, I will determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for this period, and therefore constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor's report, unless legal regulations do not allow for public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare cases, because the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report are reasonably expected to outweigh the public benefit that would result, and I decide not to communicate that matter in the report.\n\n# External Exchange Fund – Financial Statement Notes\n\n(Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are listed in Hong Kong dollars in millions.)\n\n# 1 Main business\n\nThe Monetary Authority, acting in its capacity as manager of the Exchange Fund (the Fund) and pursuant to the powers conferred by the Financial Secretary, manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).
