{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","zh":"二零一九年絕非平淡無奇的一年。\n\n美中貿易緊張局勢仍然是巨大的變數。 關於全球兩大經濟體之間貿易談判的持續不確定性，動搖了投資者的信心，並削弱了國際貿易、製造業、投資甚至消費。 全球經濟擴張不再是理所當然。 在該年度，全球經濟進入同步放緩的階段。 為了應對增長放緩，世界各主要中央銀行已逆轉其貨幣政策正常化的進程。\n\n本地在下半年發生的社會事件進一步打擊了香港經濟。零售、旅遊和餐飲行業受到的影響尤為嚴重。2019年全年，香港經濟萎縮了1.2%，為十年來的首次年度下滑，而失業率從年初的多年低位2.8%上升至3.3%。2020年伊始，新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19）疫情對全球及本地經濟構成又一重大威脅。\n\n面對如此不明朗且充滿挑戰的環境，維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定至關重要，正如我於二零一九年十月一日接任香港金融管理局行政總裁時所明確表示。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心之基石\n\n自1983年實施的聯繫匯率制度，協助香港度過無數挑戰和衝擊，充分顯示其作為香港經濟繁榮的基石以及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管今年面對嚴峻的外部和內部環境，聯繫匯率制度運作依然暢順且有秩序，再次證明其在不確定時期所展現的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦保持穩健和強勁。事實勝於雄辯：港元匯率保持穩定，並在近幾個月增強至可兌換約束區強側，而銀行存款在年內持續增長。總而言之，未見港元或銀行體系出現明顯資金外流情況。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行體系穩定，反映出我們體系不僅穩健，更備受信心。這並非一蹴可幾，而是多年來累積緩衝，加強監管的成果，並輔以我們對社交媒體平台上的謠言迅速作出回應。\n\n多年來為應對突發情況所做的準備，為香港的貨幣及銀行體系奠定了堅實的基礎，並構建了強大的緩衝。除了我們庫房中龐大的外匯儲備外，我們的銀行體系擁有雄厚的資本緩衝、充裕的流動性以及優良的資產質素，無論以國際標準或歷史經驗來看皆是如此。自2009年起實施的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，針對房地產按揭貸款，亦大大提升了銀行在房地產市場下行時的抗風險能力。\n\n市場監察和銀行監理是我們維持貨幣和銀行穩定的核心工作，我們一直致力加強監察和監理框架。除了密切監控銀行的信貸和流動性風險外，本年度我們的新舉措是善用科技和從銀行收集的精細數據，以更深入和及時的方式增強我們對港元資金和金融市場活動的監控能力。鑒於經濟和經營環境快速變化，我們也加強了壓力測試和應急規劃。\n\n事實上，我們穩健的監管制度已獲得國際社會的高度肯定。年內，國際貨幣基金組織重申香港具備充分緩衝，能夠有效應對週期性和結構性轉變。此外，香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖融資方面的有效法律及制度框架，亦獲得金融行動專案組（FATF）的正面評估，使香港成為亞太地區首個在FATF相互評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基石，對於維護貨幣及金融穩定至關重要。為了維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能對香港貨幣或銀行體系產生懷疑的惡意謠言保持高度警惕，並迅速作出回應。鑑於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及，這尤其重要。在社會動盪期間，雖然有不懷好意者在社交媒體平台上散布各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速且清晰地澄清這些謠言，證明是有效且有益的，有助於澄清事實、阻止虛假謠言進一步蔓延，並維護國際及公眾對我們體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的基石，在確保社會和經濟順暢運作方面扮演著舉足輕重的角色。儘管自今年下半年以來營運環境充滿挑戰，銀行業仍與各方攜手努力，竭盡所能維持核心功能的正常運作，並繼續為企業和公眾提供服務。\n\n除了基本的銀行服務，例如存款和轉帳外，銀行的一項重要功能是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們充分意識到並關注企業，尤其是中小企業在艱難的經濟環境下所面臨的現金流問題。在維護銀行體系穩定的前提下，我們已推出一系列舉措，以確保持續向中小企業提供資金支持。具體而言，銀行逆周期資本緩衝比率已於2019年10月和2020年3月兩次下調，總計150個基點，降至1.0%；銀行存款準備金率亦於2020年4月減半。這些措施釋放了約1萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行向包括中小企業在內的企業提供更多貸款空間。我們還成立了一個平台——銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，匯集香港主要銀行，共同探討和商議加強對中小企業資金支持的具體措施。我很高興看到許多銀行積極響應我們的號召，並推出了減輕客戶負擔的措施，例如為有需要的客戶提供本金延期償還，以共渡難關。\n\n鑒於部分中小企業反映開設銀行帳戶困難，而開設銀行帳戶是獲取各項銀行服務的首要步驟，過去幾年我們已致力解決此問題。我們的努力正在開花結果，企業開設帳戶的情況已見改善。為進一步促進金融普及化，香港金融管理局帶頭推出分級銀行服務，即簡約銀行戶口（簡易戶口），採用簡化的客戶盡職審查程序，為初創企業和中小企業提供傳統銀行戶口的替代方案。至今已開設超過2,800個簡易戶口。\n\n# 國際金融中心：更上一層樓\n\n我們一直都意識到需要在規管和發展之間取得合理平衡。鑑於各金融中心競爭激烈，我們必須努力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其長遠穩定。目前有四大重點工作領域：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融互聯互通，以及人才培養。\n\n# 擁抱數位時代的科技\n\n自二零一六年金融管理局設立金融科技促進辦公室，以及二零一七年推出「智慧銀行」倡議以來，香港在推廣金融科技方面一直步步為營。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的蓬勃發展，體現在快速支付系統（FPS）的強勁發展勢頭上。FPS是全球首個多幣種、跨銀行及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台。在短短15個月內，FPS的註冊人數已達四百萬，相當於七百五十萬人口中的高滲透率。政府亦已採用FPS，為公眾提供繳納稅款、地價及水費等項目的更大便利。預期越來越多的企業將使用這快捷、安全和方便的支付方式來收付款，從而提高營運效率。\n\n在銀行業方面，金融科技應用於銀行服務和業務營運方面取得了顯著進展。香港金融管理局的一項研究顯示，近九成受訪零售銀行已採用或計劃採用人工智能於其業務應用中。在金管局的推動下，銀行已將大數據和消費者行為分析應用於個人信貸產品。銀行亦已在首兩期推出超過八百個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋一系列銀行產品和服務。在鼓勵銀行使用金融科技的同時，我們亦未忽視加強科技風險管理和數碼銀行服務消費者保護的需要。我們已及時向銀行提供在這方面的監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行另一個備受關注的領域，因為它有潛力讓銀行更高效、更具成本效益地進行法規遵循和風險管理，尤其是在反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為了促進業界更廣泛採用監管科技並建立更完善的監管科技生態系統，金管局於十一月舉辦了首屆反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資監管科技論壇，並發佈了第一期監管科技通訊，探討監管科技的潛在應用案例。與此同時，作為銀行監管機構，金管局也在探索監管科技（Suptech）的應用，包括新的數據科學和分析技術，以提升工作效能和效率。我們已經展開了一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年內實施監管科技的路線圖。\n\n從更宏觀的角度來看，這僅僅是金融科技在銀行業發展的開端。香港金融管理局在今年內發出了八張虛擬銀行牌照。其中一間虛擬銀行已於2020年3月正式啟動服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行則已透過金管局的金融科技監管沙盒展開先導試驗。我期待其他虛擬銀行能盡快推出服務，並為香港市民帶來更多創新且多元化的銀行服務，從而提升我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n預期在國際層面亦會有更多令人振奮的發展。在成功完成一個概念驗證（PoC）試驗，將我們的區塊鏈貿易融資平台「貿連通」與其歐洲對應平台連接後，我們正與中國人民銀行平台進行另一次PoC試驗，為跨境貿易的數碼化鋪平道路。我們已與泰國銀行展開一項聯合研究項目，以研究央行數字貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際結算銀行亦於十一月在香港設立其首個創新樞紐中心，以促進中央銀行界別內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地證明香港在全球金融科技發展領域的領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色及可持續金融，共創美好未來\n\n與氣候相關的風險近年來備受全球關注。為貢獻全球應對此挑戰的努力，香港金融管理局於五月公布三項重點措施，以不同方式促進香港綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局正採取分三階段的方式推動綠色和可持續銀行發展。第一階段已制定評估銀行「綠色程度」的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定銀行業的監管期望和要求，以及第三階段的實施鋪平道路。\n\n作為外匯基金的經理，金管局積極推動負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入投資活動中。具體而言，我們已採納以風險調整後基準，在長期回報相若的情況下，優先考慮綠色及ESG投資的原則。自2015年作為早期投資者之一進入綠色債券市場以來，我們將繼續擴大綠色債券投資組合，並投資其他ESG資產。我們亦會攜手志同道合的投資者和監管機構，透過參與國際組織及ESG社群，推廣ESG的最佳實務。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、中美貿易紛爭持續，以及本地社會事件的影響。由於下半年經濟狀況急速惡化，勞動市場面臨日益增大的壓力。此外，由於豬肉價格急升，通脹亦有所增加。預計2020年的經濟表現仍將充滿挑戰，因為新型冠狀病毒疫情打擊了本已疲弱的經濟。鑑於艱難的經濟環境，政府及金管局已推出多項措施以支持經濟，特別是家庭和中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n繼2018年增長2.9%後，香港經濟於2019年收縮1.2%，為自2009年以來的首次年度負增長。尤其是在下半年，經濟陷入衰退，經季節性調整的實質國內生產總值（GDP）連續第二、三、四個季度下降（表1）。經濟活動的下滑反映了本地需求的顯著減少（圖1）。由於年底本地社會事件嚴重影響了消費活動和情緒，私人消費支出自2003年以來首次錄得年度下降。整體投資支出也因企業情緒低落而下降。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩以及中美貿易緊張局勢下額外徵收的關稅導致香港商品出口下降。由於社會事件導致入境旅遊嚴重惡化，服務出口也錄得歷史上最大的年度降幅。由於本地需求和轉口需求減少，商品和服務的進口也隨之惡化。綜合來看，淨貿易在2019年對GDP的貢獻為正（圖1），因為總進口下降的速度比總出口更快。\n\n鑒於嚴峻的經濟逆風，政府於二零一九年八月至十二月期間推出多輪措施，以減輕居民的財政負擔、保障就業和支援企業，特別是中小企業以及受影響較大的行業，例如零售、餐飲、交通和旅遊業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，並有助減緩經濟週期，金管局於十月十四日宣布將銀行的逆週期性資本緩衝比率由百分之二點五降至百分之二點零，藉此為銀行提供更多彈性，釋放二千億至三千億港元的銀行信貸予企業，包括中小企業，並成立銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制。九月份推出為中小企業融資擔保計劃（簡稱「信保計劃」）八成擔保產品的新紓緩措施，讓現金流轉差的中小企業借款人申請本金延期，以獲得即時支援。此外，十二月份推出信保計劃下的全新九成貸款擔保產品，為中小企業、經營經驗相對較少的企業以及尋求自立專業人士提供額外融資支援。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順且有秩序。港元匯率在全年大致保持穩定。由於三月份觸發了弱方兌換承諾，金管局以每1美元兌7.85港元的匯率向銀行買入港元，並賣出美元，導致根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，總結餘有所下降。港元銀行同業拆息長端維持大致穩定，而短期利率普遍上升。在零售層面，多間零售銀行在美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調後，於十月底將最優惠貸款利率下調12.5個基點。至於貨幣總量方面，2019年銀行總貸款增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%為高，而全年總存款增長2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n剔除政府一次性救濟措施的影響後，核心通脹率在2019年略微上升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%有所增加。通脹溫和上升主要受到自五月起鮮豬肉供應受阻導致豬肉價格上漲的影響（圖表2）。撇除基本食品價格，全年的物價壓力維持在適度水平。具體而言，由於私人住宅新租賃市場的整固，消費者物價指數中的住房成分有所回軟。更廣泛地看，名義工資溫和增長以及商業租金增長放緩有助於控制本地企業成本。外部方面，進口物價通脹有所緩和，與全球經濟增長放緩下部分香港主要進口來源地的通脹下降相符。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年勞動力市場大致保持韌性，但下半年面臨日益增大的壓力（圖表3）。在首兩個季度維持於多年低位的2.8%後，經季節性調整的失業率在第三季度上升至2.9%，第四季度進一步升至3.3%。其中，與消費和旅遊相關行業的失業率上升幅度更為顯著，這與社會事件有關。整體勞動力需求在年底亦明顯收縮，總就業人數和私營部門空缺職位均有下降。勞動力需求減少尤其明顯地體現在零售、住宿和餐飲服務業，以及進出口貿易和建築業。在勞動力供給方面，勞動參與率略有下降，部分原因是經濟衰退的週期性影響。隨著勞動力市場壓力不斷增大，年底名義工資和收入增長出現放緩跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了劇烈的波動。在首四個月的市場反彈後，恆生指數在五月份因美國與中國貿易緊張局勢再次升級的憂慮而大幅下跌（圖表4）。儘管在六月份受到主要中央銀行釋出更寬鬆貨幣政策信號的帶動，部分彌補了前期損失，但股價再次受到全球經濟增長放緩和本地社會事件的壓力。 年底，在美國與中國大陸達成「第一階段」貿易協議的消息公布後，股價重新獲得一些上升動力。恆生指數以28,190點收尾，全年總計上漲9.1%。相比之下，平均每日成交額較去年下降約19%。 一家大型大陸科技公司和一家領先的啤酒製造商的上市，有助於通過首次公開募股（IPO）籌集的股本資金在2019年擴大至3142億港元。香港在2019年連續第二年成為全球IPO籌資額最高的地區。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n2019年首五個月住宅物業市場強勁反彈，但下半年則普遍趨於軟化。市場情緒在2019年初有所改善，部分原因是美中貿易緊張局勢一度緩和，但隨後因美中貿易緊張局勢再次升級、社會事件持續以及本地經濟狀況轉弱而受到打擊。整體而言，樓價在五月高峰期至十二月期間溫和下跌了5%，但由於首五個月反彈了10%（圖表4），全年仍錄得5%的增長。2019年交易量較前一年增加4%，達到59,797個單位，反映年初強勁的交易活動。房屋負擔能力仍然吃緊，價收入比和按揭成數比分別維持在17.9和80.9的高位，遠高於長期平均水平。為協助有即時住房需求的購房者，香港按揭證券公司（港按證）於十月中旬提高了符合按揭保險計劃的已落成住宅物業估值上限。另一方面，2019年非住宅物業市場面臨更大的下行壓力。特別是，零售商鋪的價格和租金錄得自2008年全球金融危機以來最大跌幅，反映當年惡化的商業環境。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港於2020年的經濟表現預料將極具挑戰，並伴隨新冠疫情爆發所帶來的重大下行風險。零售、住宿、餐飲、旅遊和交通等行業，尚未從社會事件造成的擾亂中復甦，將會遭受雙重打擊。然而，在2020\/21年度財政預算案中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金派發以及在信貸保障計劃下提供政府百分百擔保的新優惠低息貸款，預計將為經濟提供一定支持，特別是家庭和中小企業。香港金融管理局於2020年3月16日進一步將銀行的逆周期資本緩衝比率從2.0%降低至1.0%，這將有助於銀行更積極地支持本地經濟，特別是預期因新冠疫情爆發而面臨額外短期壓力的行業和個人。從GDP組成部分分析，由於消費者和企業信心脆弱，私人消費和投資可能仍然疲弱。雖然政府消費將有助於經濟增長，但隨著部分大型基礎設施項目的完成，公共投資支出預計將相對緩慢。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議短期內對本地經濟的影響被評估為略為正面。然而，香港的對外貿易表現將繼續受到全球經濟增長和貿易流量疲軟的影響。特別是，新冠疫情爆發可能導致區域供應鏈中斷和跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，從而制約香港的出口。政府預測2020年實際GDP增長介於-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織和私人分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n預期由於經濟狀況欠佳、私人住宅租賃市場整合以及溫和的進口通膨，2020年的通膨壓力將會緩和。市場普遍預測2020年的整體通膨率為1.8%，而政府預測整體及核心通膨率將分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動市場方面，鑑於經濟前景疲弱及新型冠狀病毒疫情的影響，失業率在短期內可能進一步上升。私人分析師預計2020年的失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年的經濟展望偏向謹慎，並受到多項不確定性和風險影響，其中包括全球經濟增長放緩、中美貿易關係、中國大陸經濟表現、本地社會事件，以及新型冠狀病毒疫情持續擴散等因素。特別是，疫情長期延燒可能引發更明顯的全球經濟衰退和資產重新定價，由此產生的不利宏觀經濟環境和更趨緊縮的金融狀況，將對本地實體經濟活動構成更大的下行壓力。然而，主要中央銀行採取更協調一致的貨幣寬鬆政策，或可為疫情造成的負面經濟衝擊提供一定程度的緩衝。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在2019年表現出韌性，儘管當時面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張以及本地社會事件等多重挑戰。銀行資產負債表趨勢保持穩定，貸款和存款均呈現溫和增長。銀行業的資本和流動性狀況依然穩健，資產質素也維持良好水準。銀行業盈利能力保持穩定，資產報酬率平均值亦保持不變。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順且有秩序。港元匯率全年保持穩定，並在年底逼近兌換達陣區間強方。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一次又一次地展現了其抵禦衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這指的是港幣兌美元在港幣7.75至7.85元的區間內，於外匯市場保持穩定的外匯價值。 貨幣制度的結構以聯繫匯率制度為特色，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有100%的美元儲備於外匯基金作支持，而貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對等。\n\n貨幣基礎（表 1）包括：\n\n債務憑證，為三家發券銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保。\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣流通量，即銀行於金管局所持結算戶餘額總和。\n\n由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及儲蓄證。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，仰賴自動調整利率機制的運作，以及香港金融管理局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方兌換承諾水平每1美元7.75港元時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求，出售港元以換取美元。此舉將增加結餘，以降低港元利率，從而營造有利於港元遠離強方限位，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區間內的貨幣狀況。反之，若港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方兌換承諾水平每1美元7.85港元時，金管局亦隨時準備應銀行要求，購入港元。此舉將減少結餘，以提高港元利率，從而推動港元遠離弱方限位，並維持在兌換區間內。\n\n# 二零一九年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，且本地經濟增長放緩，港元在2019年仍保持穩定，並以暢順有序的方式進行交易。年初時，港元對美元利率差擴大，吸引了賣出港元買入美元的套利交易活動，導致港元匯率逼近弱方兌換保證位7.85（圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續走弱，三月份最終觸發了八次弱方兌換保證位。此後，港元繼續在弱方兌換保證位7.85附近徘徊。自五月底以來，由於規模較大的首次公開募股（IPO）活動、企業股息支付需求以及半年度結算，港元需求強勁，推動港元匯率走強。雖然港元在半年度結束後一度回落，但從十月底起再次回升，並在年底保持在強方兌換保證位。這反映了部分與股權相關的需求，包括首次公開募股，以及由於年底前流動性收緊而平倉的港元空頭頭寸。總體而言，2019年全年港元外匯市場運作正常。\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換機制，於2018年末的總結餘（不包括再貼現窗口）及未償還的交換基金票據總額，由港幣1,136.2億元下降至2019年末的港幣1,133.0億元（圖表2）。年內，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，應銀行要求以弱方兌換價7.85購入總額為港幣22.1億元，導致總結餘（不包括再貼現窗口）由2018年末的港幣76.4億元減少至2019年末的港幣54.3億元。未償還的交換基金票據在年內略有增加，由港幣1,059.8億元增至港幣1,078.7億元，反映了根據既定慣例發行交換基金票據以吸納交換基金票據的利息支付。整體貨幣基礎完全以外匯儲備支持。於2019年末，總結餘（不包括再貼現窗口）及未償還的交換基金票據總額為港幣1,133億元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n於二零一九年，港元同業拆息長端大致維持穩定，而短期拆息則普遍上升（圖表三）。短期拆息亦因首次公開招股（IPO）相關的資金需求及季節性資金狀況而出現較大波動。自二零一八年四月起，總結餘減少，或已導致港元同業拆息對本地市場港元資金供需變動的敏感度提高。\n\n基準利率於8月1日、9月19日及10月31日共下調75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至11月初的2.00%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次下調，總計75個基點，從2.25%至2.50%降至1.50%至1.75%。於11月18日至26日及12月19日至31日，基準利率設定在2.00%以上，反映出當年最後兩個月隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）顯著上升的趨勢。因此，基準利率在2019年底收報2.49%。基準利率的調整符合2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，該公式規定基準利率定為美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限以上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月HIBOR五日移動平均值的平均數，取較高者。在零售方面，聯邦基金利率目標區間於10月底下調後，多家零售銀行隨之將最佳貸款利率下調12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期點差在首兩個月擴大，大致追隨港元兌美元利率差的走勢，2月至中期12個月港元遠期點差達負708點左右（圖表4）。隨後，隨著港元兌美元負利率差的縮窄，港元遠期點差逐步收窄，並在年底轉為溢價。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順。於2019年，再貼現窗口借款減少至383億港元，較2018年的402億港元為低。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度在過去三十多年來對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了重要貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其韌性。在今年發生的社會事件背景下，一些無根據的謠言在社交媒體上流傳，質疑聯繫匯率制度及香港的金融穩定。金管局迅速且有力地運用傳統媒體和社交媒體闢謠，向公眾保證聯繫匯率制度將維持不變，香港不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局發佈了多篇文章，幫助公眾了解聯繫匯率制度的運作、資金流向及利率前景。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯繫匯率制度的信心，全年市場運作井然有序便可證明。政府亦堅定支持聯繫匯率制度。外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了公眾對政府承諾及使用港元作為支付及價值儲存手段的信心。國際貨幣基金會在2019年對香港進行第四條諮詢時，重申了其長期以來對聯繫匯率制度的支持，認為聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港適當的匯率安排，並以香港透明的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管和監督、彈性的經濟以及審慎的財政框架為基礎。\n\n健全的銀行體系對於聯網系統的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系具有高度流動性及穩健性，流動性狀況及資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局一直密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業、物業相關及與內地相關貸款的監管。與往年相比，結餘總額較小，銀行普遍已加強其流動性管理安排，並更積極地管理其日常資金狀況。此外，金管局與銀行保持緊密溝通，以確保市場上流動資金的順暢循環，尤其是在大型首次公開招股認購期之前及期間。年內並未出現結算堵塞情況，貼現窗口繼續有效率地運作。\n\n為提高外匯基金賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分指定用於支持貨幣基礎。19年，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在109.9%至112.1%的區間內波動，未觸及上下限觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率收報111.2%（圖表5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可動用以支持港元匯率。若出現突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強有力的支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣板子委員會（編委會）監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2019年，編委會審議的議題包括一份有關「聯繫匯率承擔系統」（LERS）操作的事件研究、總結餘與香港利率之間的關係、改善及更具彈性的方法以評估期貨市場對「聯繫匯率承擔系統」的看法，以及未來首次公開招股對香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）的影響。編委會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予編委會的貨幣板運作報告，均已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融管理局研究學院（香港貨幣研究所以改組而成）致力於研究與貨幣政策、銀行及金融相關且具有政策意義的課題。這體現在香港金融管理局研究學院研究人員及海外訪學學者所探討的廣泛議題，以及其舉辦的研討會和活動中。香港金融管理局研究學院與主要中央銀行和政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為導向的研討會。其研究訪學計劃支持針對香港金融管理局、香港及區域內重要政策議題的研究項目。\n\n二零一九年，香港金融管理局研究院共接待了十四位研究學者，發表了十七篇工作論文，並舉辦了十一場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。此外，研究院還組織了三次國際研討會：\n\n第十屆國際中華經濟會議於一月十日至十一日在香港舉行，主題為「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」。本次會議由香港中文大學中國經濟研究所、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合主辦。會議為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業界的頂尖經濟專家提供了一個世界級的論壇，以探討金融改革及中國大陸經濟發展帶來的變化下，中國大陸金融業所面臨的風險等議題。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港銀行業在二零一九年保持穩健及穩定，儘管受到全球及本地經濟逆風的影響。 業界通力合作下，銀行業在社會事件期間繼續正常運作，並盡力將對公眾造成的 불편 降至最低。 年內，金管局將監管重點放在認可機構的信貸及流動性風險管理上。 鑑於網絡威脅日益增加，以及業界對科技的依賴程度不斷提高，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。 在行為監理方面，金管局簡化了投資者保護措施，以提升顧客體驗，同時保障顧客權益。 我們亦加強了數碼金融服務的消費者保護，並繼續推廣以顧客為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/打恐）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動專案組對香港反洗錢\/打恐制度第四輪相互評估的完成，評估結果顯示整體符合且有效，並特別肯定銀行界對風險的良好理解，以及金管局在反洗錢\/打恐領域的風險為本監管工作。金管局繼續參與公私合作夥伴關係，以分享有關詐欺和洗錢的情報，並積極支持銀行界採用反洗錢\/打恐監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，金管局於二零一九年發出八張虛擬銀行牌照，並公布了一項分三階段的策略，以促進香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。金管局與銀行業界保持緊密合作，優化監管政策和流程，並開展能力建設措施，以促進人才發展。\n\n與此同時，在本地實施國際監管標準方面亦取得顯著進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險敞口標準。香港金融管理局亦繼續致力確保認可機構設有可信的決議機制，包括實施關於損失吸收能力的要求，以提升認可機構的可決算性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。實現此目標取決於金融體系具備高度韌性，並能為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式，甚至在極端情況下通過混亂倒閉，都可能影響體系穩定。作為監管機構，香港金融管理局在確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位，最終有助於防止破產方面，發揮關鍵作用，以維護金融穩定。香港金融管理局負責對香港銀行進行審慎監理，包括授權設立持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。金融管理局亦負責指定和監察若干金融市場基礎設施。\n\n然而，金管局並不能保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決機構，致力於確保當認可的金融機構（AI）出現非可行情況時，其破產能夠以有序的方式處理。為此，香港已建立適用於金融機構的解決機制，金管局在此機制下擔任認可的金融機構的解決機構。為了確保香港的解決機制能夠有效運作，制定解決法規和政策標準、進行解決規劃以消除認可的金融機構可解決性的障礙，以及發展金管局處理破產認可的金融機構的運營能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採取與國際接軌且協調一致的方法。\n\n# 二零一九年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n於二零一九年，共進行了196項離場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括駱駝評級評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為金管局持續努力加強風險管治的一環，已與認可機構的董事會或董事級委員會舉行了26次會議。此外，金管局、認可機構及其外部審計師之間召開了32次三方會議。\n\n除了場外活動外，香港金融管理局還會定期進行現場檢查，並針對被評估為風險較高的領域進行主題審查。本年度共進行了405次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一個主要關注點是科技風險和營運風險管理。香港金融管理局也增加了針對流動性風險和市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足率框架實施情況的現場檢查和主題審查數量。與此同時，專業團隊對人工智能在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金業務中的活動進行了現場檢查和主題審查。\n\n表 1 載列香港金融管理局 2019 年監理活動的整體摘要。\n\n# 信用風險監控\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n銀行貸款於2019年呈現溫和增長。總貸款增長6.7%，較2018年的4.4%為高。如表2所示，用於香港及用於香港以外的貸款分別錄得7.7%及5.8%的增長。\n\n與內地相關的貸款於2019年底增長7.4%，達到4,564億港元（表3）。\n\n人工智能資產質量保持良好。零售銀行不良貸款比率由2018年底的0.51%略降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。整體銀行業的不良貸款比率則略微上升，由0.55%增至0.57%。具體而言，在與中國大陸相關的貸款方面，零售銀行不良貸款比率由2018年的0.63%增至2019年的0.79%，但仍處於歷史低位。整體銀行業的該比率則由去年的0.55%增至0.75%。\n\n年內，金管局加強監管力度，確保認可金融機構在不明朗的經濟環境下繼續採取審慎的信貸風險管理標準。壓力測試的覆蓋範圍和壓力假設均得到加強，以涵蓋更全面的風險。經加強的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極端衝擊。金管局進行了針對性和主題性的檢查，以評估認可金融機構在不同領域的信貸風險管理實務，例如向從事高風險業務的公司貸款、複雜融資安排以及向私人銀行及財富管理客戶提供的抵押貸款。鑑於中小企業在經濟下行期間可能面臨更大的挑戰，金管局於十月成立銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，旨在鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內，繼續支持中小企業的融資需求。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自2009年起，金管局已實施八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，顯著增強了香港銀行界抵禦房地產市場下行的韌性。在首次推出逆周期措施前，2009年9月，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率為64%，至2019年12月則下降至53%。同期，新按揭貸款的平均債務收入比率亦從2010年8月的41%下降至2019年12月的36%，當時首次應用了債務收入比率的上限（圖表1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監控\n\n香港金融管理局採取分三階段方式，推行於「網絡安全加強計劃」（CFI）下的網絡韌性評估框架。第一階段評估已於二零一八年完成，涵蓋所有主要銀行。第二及第三階段涵蓋的金融機構已大致如期完成評估。香港金融管理局亦已著手全面檢討「網絡安全加強計劃」，以根據過去數年的經驗，對該計劃進行微調。\n\n十月，香港金融管理局發佈了經修訂的《監理政策手冊》中關於「電子銀行風險管理」的章節。 修訂旨在為業界提供更大的彈性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。 金融管理局亦同時發佈了一系列關於人工智能應用的高層原則，以供業界參考。\n\n自六月社會事件開始以來，金管局一直與業界保持緊密溝通，以監察事件對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）的現金，並盡快維修被破壞的設施。金管局亦迅速行動，闢謠止謗，以維護公眾對銀行體系的信心。 感謝銀行業界通力合作，受影響的銀行分行及設施迅速恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的不便亦減至最低。 鑑於社會事件帶來的營運風險日益增加，銀行被要求採取額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險管理之監控\n\n於年內，已進行一輪主題審查，以評估認可金融機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點在於認可金融機構流動性壓力測試計劃及應急資金管理的穩健性。香港金融管理局亦評估認可金融機構在計算流動性覆蓋率（LCR）方面的合規情況，以確保計算所用數據的審慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著演算法交易在銀行業日益普及，香港金融管理局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估人工智能在該領域的風險管理實務。鑑於倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止刊發，香港金融管理局提醒人工智能機構為轉移至另類參考利率做好準備，並進行了一項調查以監控它們的準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資\n\n香港金融管理局對持牌人士的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資系統進行基於風險的監理。年內，共進行了18次現場檢查和61次非現場審查，其中包括針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理的重點主題審查。為協助持牌人士採納適當的開戶程序及為中小企業提供服務，金管局與業界分享了從對持牌人士應用基於風險的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制措施對中小企業進行主題審查中所得的觀察及最佳實務。\n\n# 金融行動工作組（FATF）對香港的相互評估報告\n\n二零一九年香港金融管理局及香港整體反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資制度的一大亮點，是國際行動工作組（FATF）於九月發佈的香港互評報告。該報告代表迄今為止FATF第四輪互評中，成員司法管轄區所取得的最佳成果之一。香港在評估其反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資制度的有效性方面，在十一項「即時效益」中獲得六項「充分」評級，並在互評的技術合規性方面取得高分。\n\n報告對金管局以風險為基礎的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資監管方法給予正面評價，並指出金管局對銀行業的洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險有充分了解，對儲值設施（SVF）行業的風險也有合理認識。報告亦肯定銀行業在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資方面的整體努力，例如大型認可機構增加使用數據分析，絕大多數可疑交易報告是由認可機構提交，以及業界積極參與反詐騙及洗錢情報工作組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議了數個需要改進的範疇，包括對某些較高風險領域的理解，例如海外貪腐和逃稅犯罪，以及新興領域如SVF（特殊用途載具）。 相關工作已開始展開以處理這些建議；香港金融管理局已於七月發佈了SVF領域的更新版洗錢／恐怖融資風險評估，並已開始對私人銀行以及新技術應用治理進行主題式實地檢查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場在2019年的表現優於預期，主要央行的寬鬆貨幣政策效應抵消了對全球經濟增長放緩和中美貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。全球股市在2018年第四季大幅回調後反彈，而主要政府債券收益率下降，債券價格則上漲。在這種有利的環境下，外匯基金於2019年錄得投資收入2622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 結匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》的規定，外匯基金的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯價。該基金亦可被用來維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局在財政司司長（財司）的授權下，並在授權範圍內，就外匯基金的使用和投資管理向財司負責。\n\n# 結匯基金管理制度\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n匯豐顧問委員會（EFAC）為外匯基金設定了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 以保本為首要目標；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均以高度流動的美元計價資產充分支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以協助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已融入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置。\n\n廣義而言，外匯基金主要由兩個投資組合構成：儲備組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。儲備組合持有高度流通的美元計價資產，以符合聯繫匯率制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供十足的 backing。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券和股權市場，以保值及提升其資產的長期購買力。\n\n為更有效地管理風險並提升中長期的回報，香港金融管理局會以審慎及漸進的方式，將部分外匯基金的投資分散到更廣泛的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）和房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票的投資於投資組合中持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則於長期增長投資組合（LTGP）中持有。LTGP投資的市值上限設定為外匯基金累積盈餘總額，以及與LTGP相關的未來基金和外匯基金附屬機構的投資總和的三分之一。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的策略性目的而購入。由於其獨特性質，此投資組合並未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 與外匯基金的職位\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。 利率一般與投資組合表現掛鈎，惟未來基金為主要例外，其利率與投資組合表現及長期增值計劃均有連繫，並參考投資組合的配置比例。截至2019年底，未來基金在投資組合表現及長期增值計劃之間的配置比例約為40比60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資流程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表外匯基金在投資目標下所定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以嘗試超越基準的回報。這意味著實際配置經常與基準（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。基準和追蹤誤差限額由財經事務委員會與外匯基金諮詢委員會共同決定，而戰術決策及戰術偏離的容許幅度則由金管局在授權下制定和設定。在容許的戰術偏離幅度內，投資組合經理可採取倉位以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局於二零一八年八月成立外匯基金投資事務處（EFIO），集中其投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資事務處的職員直接管理外匯基金約百分之七十一的投資，包括全部的本金部分及部分投資組合。這部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的各項衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦會聘用外部基金經理管理約佔外匯基金資產29%的資金，其中包括其所有上市股權投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的，是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識以實現可持續回報，吸納多元且互補的投資風格，並從他們獲取市場洞察及投資技術專長。\n\n與外部經理人使用相關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本以及預扣及其他稅款。這些支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，更凸顯風險管理的重要性。無論是內部或外部管理的投資組合，均已建立嚴格的控制和投資指引，並對其遵守情況及法規進行密切監察。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估已得到加強，以支持外匯基金投資組合多元化的程度提高。我們運用風險控制工具，評估在正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。此外，我們還會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以確定績效來源，從而協助金管局評估如何最佳地運用內部及外部經理的投資技能。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持責任投資（RI），將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入交易所基金的公共及私人市場投資流程中。\n\n就公開市場投資而言，金管局實施程序性和投資相關的措施。金管局採取的其中一項程序性措施是採用證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《責任投資原則》（PRO），協助投資者確定在對香港上市公司的投資中，如何最好地履行其所有者責任。在管理外匯基金方面，金管局已制定內部指引，涵蓋外部基金經理的選擇、委任和監察過程中的環境、社會和管治（ESG）因素。獲委任管理金管局香港股票及內地主動股票投資組合的外部基金經理，被要求在投資管理上遵循《責任投資原則》，並採取「遵守或解釋」原則；而委任管理金管局發達市場股票投資組合的外部基金經理則需遵守國際公認的ESG標準。除了外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦被納入金管局內部管理的債券投資的信用風險分析中。\n\n至於於公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起已投資於綠色債券，成為該市場的早期投資者之一，並參與國際金融公司主導的共同貸款投資組合計劃，該計劃專注於新興市場的永續投資。展望未來，金管局將會繼續透過直接投資或投資綠色債券基金來擴大其綠色債券投資組合。金管局亦計劃在股權投資中構建ESG主題的投資策略，採用ESG股權指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並與在投資決策中應用ESG因素的積極型股權經理合作。\n\n就私募股權投資而言，金管局在盡職調查過程中會審視普通合夥人的環境、社會及管治（ESG）政策和實務。特別是，ESG風險評估已成為所有長期策略投資組合（LTGP）投資的強制性盡職調查部分。對於長期策略投資組合，金管局投資於具備可持續特點的項目；例如，自2013年起，金管局已直接及共同投資能源領域的可再生能源，以及在其房地產投資組合中投資具備環保及可持續特點的綠色建築和倉庫。展望未來，金管局將繼續尋找具備可持續特點的項目，並將綠色認證納入房地產投資的主要考量因素。\n\n香港金融管理局將密切監察環境、社會及管治（ESG）標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入其投資流程。此流程得益於其與志同道合的投資者和相關國際組織的合作。尤其作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則的簽署者，而該原則是全球責任投資的領先倡導者，香港金融管理局期望參與ESG最佳實務的制定，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦是FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織是一個非營利機構，透過研討會和研究，致力於鼓勵企業和投資決策更著重長遠發展。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作小組的支持者。\n\n如欲了解香港金融管理局（金管局）的責任投資政策框架的更多詳情，請參閱《企業社會責任》章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 二零一九年金融市場\n\n儘管全球經濟增長放緩以及中美貿易緊張局勢引發擔憂，但由於主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策支持，全球金融市場在2019年表現良好。在2018年第四季經歷顯著調整後，全球股市在2019年反彈。在債券市場方面，由於貨幣寬鬆，主要政府債券收益率在前三季顯著下降，債券價格則上漲。雖然在第四季，隨著收益率略有回升，債券價格有所回落，但2019年債券市場的整體收益仍然令人滿意。\n\n在外匯市場中，主要貨幣對美元的表現各異。 由於美中貿易緊張局勢升級，人民幣在第三季度下跌了 3.8%，但在第四季度隨著貿易緊張局勢緩和，部分收復了前期跌幅。 總體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了 1.4%。 由於脫歐無協議的風險增加，英鎊在第三季度下跌了 3.2%，但隨著第四季度脫歐局勢更加明朗，其後顯著反彈，最終對美元升值了 4.0%。\n\n主要貨幣、債券和股票市場在2019年的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 匯風基金表現\n\n交換基金於二零一九年錄得投資收入港幣二百六十二點二億元。這包括債券收益港幣一百一十四點五億元、香港股票收益港幣二十二點一億元、其他股票收益港幣一百零零點七億元、非港幣資產的負面貨幣換算影響港幣負十三點零億元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益港幣三十七點九億元。另計，策略投資組合錄得估值收益港幣二十五億元。\n\n於年末，交換基金總資產達4,206.7億港元。長期投資組合（LTGP）的投資市值總額為3,351億港元，其中私募股權為2,334億港元，房地產為1,017億港元。未償投資承諾額達2,193億港元。\n\n二零一九年，交易所基金的投資回報率（不包括策略投資組合）為百分之六點六。具體而言，投資組合錄得百分之九點七的回報率，而債券投資組合則錄得百分之二點五的回報率。自二零零九年成立以來，長期增長計劃的內部收益率年化為百分之十二點六。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n","zh":"# 匯豐儲備基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財務司\n\n# 觀點\n\n我謹此證明，我已審核了第187至293頁所載的交換基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）財務報表，包括截至2019年12月31日的交換基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至同日止年度的收益及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包括重要的會計政策摘要。\n\n本人認為，截至二零一九年十二月三十一日，該基金及集團的財務報表真實及公允地反映了彼時的財務狀況，以及彼時年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港會計準則」）編製，且符合根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官指示所作出的適當準備。\n\n# 觀點依據\n\n我依照《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官指示及審計署審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則的職責於我的報告中「審計師就財務報表審計的責任」一段進一步闡述。我符合該等準則的要求，與本集團保持獨立，並已履行根據該等準則的其他專業道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據充分及適當，為我提供發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我對截至2019年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計過程中，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。這些事項已在整個財務報表審計的背景下加以處理，並在形成我的審計意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 金融資產與金融負債以公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n於二零一九年十二月三十一日，本集團的金融資產總額為港幣三兆八千七百四十二億兩千三百萬元，金融負債總額為港幣一兆一千五百八十六億八千六百萬元，均以公允價值計量。\n\n對於91%的這些金融資產及全部這些金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價 (第一級輸入)，或使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術來估計 (第二級輸入)。\n\n至於其餘9%的這些金融資產，其公允價值乃使用未使用可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術來估計（第三級輸入）。 這些金融資產總額為港幣3,387.58億元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於其金額重大且涉及估計，以公允價值衡量金融資產和金融負債為關鍵審計事項。\n\n對金融資產及金融負債以公允價值衡量之審計程序包括：\n\n瞭解評估不同類別的金融資產與金融負債的程序，包括相關的控制措施；\n\n評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統相關的應用程式控制。\n\n取得外部確認以驗證財務資產與財務負債的價值、存在性、權利義務及完整性；\n\n在採用報價市場價格時，會核實價格的獨立來源；\n\n在採用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術的情況下，評估估值方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並將輸入數據核證至獨立來源；以及\n\n於採用以不可觀測市場數據為輸入的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適當性以及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業以公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n本集團的投資物業以其公允價值列賬，於二零一九年十二月三十一日達至港幣二萬二千四百八十一萬港元。本集團亦於二十二項合營企業中擁有權益，總額為港幣四萬四千五百零六萬港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。無論由本集團直接持有或由合營企業持有，這些投資物業的公允價值主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值確定。 該等估值涉及重大的判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所用假設。\n\n投資物業以公允價值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱本集團直接持有或透過合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值乃基於估值報告中所列的估值。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性與資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法之適當性，以及假設和輸入數據之合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資料。 這些資料包括香港金融管理局2019年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計報告。\n\n我的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我對此不提供任何形式的保証結論。\n\n與我審核財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或我在審核過程中所得知的資訊存在重大不符，或在其他方面存在重大錯誤陳述。如果基於我已完成的工作，我認為該等其他資料存在重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。就此，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 香港金融管理局及匯風諮詢委員會審核委員會於財務報表中的職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示編製真實公允的財務報表，並為此建立內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及採用持續經營為基礎會計處理。\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會審核小組負責監察本集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確定財務報表整體而言是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論該錯誤陳述是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並發出包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並不能保證按照審計署審計準則進行的審計總能發現已存在的重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，如果這些錯誤陳述單獨或彙總起來，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則認為其屬重大。\n\n作為根據審計署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我貫徹專業判斷，並於整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，不論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致；設計及執行對應這些風險的審計程序；並獲取足夠及適切的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。因舞弊導致的重大錯誤陳述未被發現的風險，較因錯誤導致的風險為高，因為舞弊可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上。\n\n以了解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計適當於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見。\n\n評估貨幣當局採納的會計政策之適當性，以及會計估計與相關披露之合理性。\n\n我需要評估金融管理局採用持續經營會計基準的恰當性，並根據所獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大疑慮的事件或情況所導致的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我需要於審計報告中引起注意，指向財務報表中的相關披露，或倘若該等披露不足，則修改我的審計意見。我的結論基於截至審計報告日所獲取的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致本集團停止持續經營。\n\n評估財務報表之整體表達、結構及內容，包括所作之揭露，以及財務報表是否以達成公允表達之方式呈現其所反映之相關交易及事件；並取得關於本集團內各實體或業務活動之足夠及適切之審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督及執行本集團審計。我對我的審計意見負全部責任。\n\n我會與證券基金諮詢委員會審核小組就審計範圍和時間安排（包括我於審計過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷）以及重大審計發現等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向彼等通報所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及如適用者，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事宜，我確定本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，並將其定為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為在報告中溝通該事項會導致負面後果合理預計超過此類溝通的公共利益，否則我會在我的審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n朱約翰\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n香港灣仔告士威道7號\n入境事務大樓26樓\n\n2020年4月3日\n"}
