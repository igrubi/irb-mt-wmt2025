{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

stage. The Brexit referendum and the outcome of the US presidential election certainly rendered various polls laughable, but what was even more unexpected was the reaction of the financial markets. Taking the US election as an example, the news of Trump’s election led to an immediate plunge in the... US stock futures, but shortly after the market opened, US stock Index rebounded and subsequently trended upward, repeatedly reaching new highs. This series of events highlights the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market ability, and also marks a major uncertainty in the Future development of the global situation.\n\nOver the past year, several major financial data points all reflected unusually sensitive market sentiments: the US 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to a record low of 1.36 in July before surging to 2.6 in mid-December following the US presidential election. The US dollar Index, reflecting the movements of the US dollar against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high at year-end; New York crude oil futures rebounded from a low of $26 per barrel at the beginning of the year to $54 at year-end. Regarding the Hong Kong stock market, the Hang Seng Index saw a slight increase of 86 points for the whole year, but the difference between its peak and trough during the period exceeded 6,000 points. The external environment was turbulent, further enhancing the importance and preciousness of maintaining financial system stability, especially banking stability and monetary stability.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors swirled that international hedge funds were deploying to attack the renminbi and Hong Kong dollar, causing market anxiety. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority promptly released clear and firm information to the market, stating that we have absolute confidence and ability to defend the linked exchange rate system and the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system, thereby stabilizing market confidence in a timely manner. Looking back at the whole of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained close to the strong-side convertibility guarantee for a long time. Due to ample funding within the banking system, even the interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve in December last year and March this year did not have a significant immediate impact on Hong Kong dollar interest rates and exchange rates.\n\nHong Kong’s banking system will continue to develop steadily, with overall loans achieving 6.5% moderate growth last year, while asset quality remained healthy and the non-performing loan rate maintained a healthy level of 0.85%, well below the long-term average of approximately 2% since 2000. The banking system’s capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio both remained at high levels above statutory requirements. Regarding mortgage business, after seven rounds of counter-cyclical measures, the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly granted residential property mortgages decreased from 64% in September 2009 to 51% at the end of 2016, and the average debt-to-income ratio also declined from 41% in August 2010 to 34% at the end of 2016, providing the necessary Buffer for the banking system in the face of shocks should the property market reverse. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to monitor the development of the property market, and will take appropriate measures in accordance with cyclical changes to maintain banking stability.\n\nFurther strengthening legislative work on banking system stability made encouraging progress last year. Optimising the Deposit Protection Scheme and two pieces of legislation aimed at the risk of financial institutions being “too big to fail” were smoothly passed before the end of the last Legislative Council session. The former quickens the payout speed of the Deposit Protection Scheme, simplifies the payout process, and helps enhance depositors’ confidence in the banking system; the latter establishes a resolution regime for financial institutions including banks, preventing systemic financial risks should they fail, and to the extent possible avoiding the use of public funds to bail them out. The HKMA has already established a resolution office on April 1 of this year to implement the requirements of the legislation and follow-up work.\n\nThe banking sector is known as “the mother of all industries” and is the savings, payment channels, and credit Source relied upon by the real economy and the general public in their daily lives. Within the year, some representatives from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) reflected difficulties in obtaining funding. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority immediately communicated with the banking sector, hoping that banks would continue to provide funding support for the operations and development of SMEs, while maintaining prudent risk management. We also strengthened the promotion of the Government’s “sMe Financing Guarantee Scheme” through our subsidiary, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, and maintained close communications with the banking industry to dispel doubts, clarify misinterpretations and streamline the claims procedures for bad debts, thereby enhancing banks’ willingness to participate in the scheme. Through a multi-pronged approach, we have achieved a certain effectiveness. According to a survey of banks conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the overall credit limit for SMEs remained stable last year, and the credit limit for over 90% of enterprises was maintained or even increased. At the same time, the number of applications for the “sMe Financing Guarantee Scheme” also increased significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strongly promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services are an indispensable part of doing business and daily life. Last year, when we learned that some overseas companies and startups were experiencing difficulties with account opening in Hong Kong, we immediately launched follow-up work, contacted a number of international chambers of commerce and business associations, and engaged in in-depth communications with the banking sector to address the issue. In September last year, I issued a circular to all banks in Hong Kong, explaining how to understand the HKMA’s “risk-based” regulatory principles for combating anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, how to apply this approach to account opening applications and due diligence reviews of existing clients, and emphasizing that banks should not adopt a “one-size-fits-all” approach and procedures for all customers. Following negotiations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account opening has improved, but there is still room for improvement, which is also one of our key priorities this year.\n\nFinancial inclusion also involves the coverage of bank branch services. The HKMA has consistently encouraged banks to consider the basic banking service needs of the public while pursuing business profits. Fintech is developing rapidly, and the channels banks provide services through are becoming more diversified. In addition to the increasingly popular online banking services, several banks launched mobile bank vehicles or video teller machines last year, providing more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. With our promotion, several banks are also planning to establish real branches in remote areas, enhancing services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial centre is like swimming upstream. Therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continuously sought new opportunities for the development of Hong Kong’s financial industry over the years, and explored new areas. 2016 can be described as a year of abundant results, including Fintech and infrastructure finance as highlights.\n\nIn the Fintech sector, Hong Kong’s retail payment services entered a new era in 2016. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued 13 stored value payment facilities licences last year, fostering a conducive environment for retail payment services through licensing and ongoing supervisory regime, coupled with a series of publicity to ensure that consumers’ ownership is reasonably protected while enjoying the convenience brought by new technology.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Fintech Facilitation office last March as a platform to promote the development of financial technology related to the banking sector. Over the past few months, we have launched several new initiatives, including the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative, to establish a three-pronged new platform for risk assessment, information sharing, and talent development to strengthen the cybersecurity of the banking system. We also cooperate with the Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct specialized research on distributed ledger technology, explore the resolvability of its application in the Hong Kong banking sector, and establish a Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to the banking sector and the Fintech community. The HKMA’s banking supervision department has also established a Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, allowing banks to test the application of new technologies in a smaller and controllable environment, accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, 6 banks have used the sandbox to test a total of 14 new technology projects, and some projects have been launched into the market in succession, providing members of the public with more new Fintech products.\n\nThe demand for infrastructure financing is huge worldwide, especially since the launch of the Belt and Road initiative, which has made infrastructure financing a key issue attracting attention from both China and abroad. Hong Kong is an International financial centre in Asia and possesses unparalleled strength in the field of infrastructure financing. Last year, in July, the HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO), building a new and unique platform to bring together more than 60 world-class multilateral institutions, asset owners, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, as well as the construction and operating parties of infrastructure projects, and various professional institutions, to exchange information, share experience, and seek cooperation opportunities regarding infrastructure investment and financing issues. Since its establishment, IFFO has held more than ten large-scale conferences, seminars and workshops. The HKMA has also signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank and The Export-Import Bank of China to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although it has not been established for a long time, it has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s future as an infrastructure investment and financing centre.\n\nRemoving barriers and deregulation is the only way to enhance competitiveness. Within the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively participated in and provided support to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in amending the taxation Ordinance, providing a conducive environment for companies with in-house treasury financing activities operating in Hong Kong. We are also actively reaching out to multinational companies, attracting them to develop or expand their treasury financing activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of the Hong Kong financial markets.\n\nLast year, the offshore Renminbi market was in a period of adjustment. Affected by market volatility and expectations regarding the exchange rate, the global offshore Renminbi funding pool generally contracted. Despite this, Hong Kong remains the leader in offshore Renminbi business, maintaining the world’s largest Renminbi funding pool, with Renminbi cleared through Hong Kong remaining at a high of approximately RMB860 billion per day. To further improve liquidity arrangements in the Hong Kong offshore Renminbi market, in October last year we increased the number of primary liquidity providing institutions from 7 to 9, bringing the total commitment for bilateral funding from the original RMB140 billion to RMB180 billion, ensuring that the market can continue to operate in an orderly manner even when there is a liquidity crunch in the offshore Renminbi market. The launch of the “Stock Connect” between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in December last year further boosted Hong Kong’s Renminbi business. The HKMA is also working with relevant authorities on the mainland to study the “Bond Connect” scheme, further facilitating participation by investors on both sides in the bond market and enhancing the connection of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite last year’s global investment environment being full of various unstable factors, thanks to several defensive deployments taken over the past period, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$68.1 billion in investment income last year. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund has achieved an annual investment return Rate of 4.8%, higher than the local inflation Rate of 2.1% during the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversification of investments, including further expanding asset classes and increasing investment in credit assets, inflation-hedging investment products, and emerging markets. As a flagship of diversified investment, the “Long-Term Growth Portfolio” invests in alternative assets through private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has consistently delivered strong performance, with an average annualised internal rate of return of about 12% since its establishment. With a portion of the Government’s “Future Fund” commitments allocated to the portfolio, we have quickened the pace of investment. At the end of last year, the asset scale of the “Long-Term Growth Portfolio” was approximately HK$181.8 billion, with a total amount of HK$133.8 billion granted but not yet drawn down for investment. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to the investment strategy of “capital preservation first, long-term appreciation”, seeking long-term stable returns while maintaining ample liquidity and reserve funds.\n"}

subdued, Hong Kong’s economic growth softens. Within the year, the local stock market and residential property market experienced volatility, and housing affordability remains stretched.\n\nDespite global market risks and increasing shocks, Hong Kong’s banking system remains robust. Banks’ capital and liquidity positions remain good; asset quality worsened with slight signs, but remains at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary stability\n\nDespite faced with a turbulent external environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable, reflecting the resilience of the linked exchange rate system to external shocks.\n\nMonetary markets continue to operate smoothly, and banks’ liquidity is ample. In December, following the decision of the uS Federal Reserve to adjusted upwards the Federal Funds Rate target range, the basic interest rate in Hong Kong was adjusted upwards 25 basis points to 1.00.\n\n# Banking system stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is strengthening the supervisory risk governance framework of banks, as well as credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also takes concrete action to promote financial inclusion and deal with the difficulties companies encounter in opening and maintaining accounts in Hong Kong.\n\nIn terms of supervisory policies, significant progress has been made in preparing for the implementation of International regulatory and accounting standards in Hong Kong, including the resolution framework under the Ordinance on Financial Institutions (resolution mechanism).\n\n# Hong Kong’s International financial centre status\n\nHong Kong maintains its position as a global hub for offshore renminbi business and asset management centre. The tax system has been further refined, fostering a more conducive environment, attracting multinational companies to establish treasury centres in Hong Kong.\n\nTo foster the Development of Hong Kong as an Infrastructure financing centre with a Fintech Hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation office and the Fintech Facilitation office. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority smoothly began implementation of the regulatory regime for stored value payment facilities and retail payment systems, and granted 13 stored value payment licences.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nDespite the difficult investment environment full of black swan events, thanks to the series of defensive measures taken over the years, the Exchange Fund’s resilience was enhanced, and the Exchange Fund recorded a 2% overall investment return.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority quickens the pace of diversification of investment activities, especially long-term growth portfolios investment.\n\n# Functions of institutions\n\nThe HKMA operates through media, public education programmes and other various channels to maintain effective communications with the community and markets, to facilitate public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operation.\n\nThe HKMA continues to strengthen corporate governance, including supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing Fintech security, to help cope with the challenges brought by the implementation of new measures and increasing complexity of work.\n"}

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖

通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖

物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising in","leveraging

economic growth softened in 2016. Faced with increased external environment uncertainty, 2017 economic growth is expected to remain moderate.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth slowed in 2016, with real Gross Domestic Product growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Chart 1). Net exports were the main drag, with the subdued performance of inbound tourism weighing down exports of services (Figure 1). Domestic demand also moderated, but continued to provide primary support for overall economic growth. The labour market remained broadly stable, with the unemployment rate maintaining a low level of 3.3% to 3.4%. Due to the easing of local costs and external prices pressures, consumer price inflation further slowed. Faced with a volatile external environment and shifting market sentiments, asset markets experienced increased fluctuations. In the light of a renewed boom in the residential property market, the Government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite turbulent external environments and rising US interest rates, the local foreign exchange and monetary market continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate hovered around the 7.75 level after a slight deterioration in January. The exchange guarantee was not triggered throughout the year, and the combined total of the Exchange Fund’s outstanding Bills and Notes and bonds remained almost unchanged, at approximately HK$1.2 trillion. Following the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike in mid-December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s base rate was adjusted upwards from 0.75% to 1%. Hong Kong interbank offered Rates (HIBORs) and longer-term bond yields remained at relatively low levels, but rose slightly towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the movements of corresponding US HIBORs and yields. Overall bank lending growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. Although overall loan quality weakened slightly, the ratio of classified loans remained at extremely low levels.\n\nFigure 1 Contribution to the growth of real local gross domestic product by sector\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 1: Real domestic gross product growth by expenditure item (compared to the previous period)\n\nNote: The quarterly change in the total amount of fixed capital formation, seasonally adjusted, is not detailed.\nSources of information: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# local demand\n\nLocal demand grew at a slightly weaker pace in 2016. Despite maintaining... stability in employment and income conditions continuing to provide full support for private consumption, its growth slowed to 1.6%, partly reflecting increased economic uncertainty. Government consumption growth also slowed slightly to 3.3%. Local fixed capital formation continued to fluctuate markedly on a quarterly basis (Chart 2), with a cumulative contraction of 0.5% for the whole year. Purchases of plant and equipment by the private sector became a major drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid poor business prospects, while building and construction activity turned buoyant due to increased housing project implementation.\n\nFigure 2 local demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# external demand\n\nHong Kong exports showed signs of stabilising towards the end of 2016, but the overall performance for the whole year remained weak (Chart 3). Merchandise exports rose by 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Hong Kong’s exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, with trade fund flows in the region becoming more stable, Hong Kong’s exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan improved compared to 2015.\n\nPartly reflecting the retail sales normalisation process after growing rapidly over the years, Hong Kong exports of services shrank significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Merchandise imports recouped some ground in 2016 after contracting in 2015, while imports of services continued to grow, partly benefiting from local residents’ willingness to travel abroad. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, weighing down domestic economic growth.\n\nFigure 3 Goods exports and exports of services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary stress remained contained in 2016. After removing the effect of the Government’s one-time relief measures, the basic rate of inflation decreased from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Chart 4). The rental component in the Composite Consumer Price Index saw a drop in inflation brought about by the downward adjustment in newly-leased private residential rental. Benefiting from soft global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar, imported price inflation was suppressed. On the other hand, with stable growth in labour costs and eased rental cost stress (particularly in the retail sector), local cost pressures remained moderate.\n\nFigure 4 Basic Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# labour markets\n\nThe labour market remained largely stable in 2016, with the increase in labour supply and demand at a similar pace. According to industry analyses, the labour market conditions of the tourism-related industry deteriorated, while other industries remained generally stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment Rate rose from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Chart 5). With banking stability in the labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, while the increase in 2015 was 4.6%. Real labour earnings also increased by 0.9% in the first three quarters, while the increase in 2015 was 1.5%.\n\nFigure 5 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market fluctuated markedly in 2016. Affected by the pressure of Renminbi depreciation and turbulence in the mainland China stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). The Hong Kong stock market recovered in March, following solid gains in the US and other major markets. Despite the Brexit referendum triggering market volatility, market sentiments quickly improved as the Federal Reserve was expected to slow the pace of interest rate hikes and other major central banks implemented loose monetary policies. The Hang Seng Index rose to a year-high of 24,100 points in September. However, affected by the outcome of the US presidential election and the expectation that the US would quicken the pace of interest rate hikes, the Hong Kong stock market came under pressure again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hang Seng Index saw a slight increase of 0.4% in 2016, while it declined by 7.2% in 2015. The average daily turnover decreased from HK$105.6 billion in the previous year to HK$66.9 billion, and the total amount of capital raised by the Hong Kong stock market also decreased from HK$111.56 billion in the previous year to HK$49.01 billion.\n\nFigure 6 asset prices\nSource of information: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# property markets\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight volatility in 2016. Property turnover recorded a record low in the first quarter before recovering somewhat in the subsequent months, but fell sharply again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, turnover decreased slightly to 54,701 items in 2016. On the other hand, prices rose since the second quarter and exceeded the peak of September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% in 2016 (Figure 6). Housing affordability remains stretched, with the price-to-income ratio at 15.9, exceeding the historical high in 1997; and the income leverage ratio at 72.0%, significantly higher than the long-term average. Due to banks launching competitive mortgage schemes, mortgage rates fell slightly, then experienced a slight increase towards the end of the year following the rise in Hong Kong interbank offered Rates (HIBORs). Regarding the commercial property market, overall trading remained stable throughout the year. As non-residential property prices fell from their 2015 high, corresponding rental yields increased slightly compared to the previous year, but remained at a low level.\n\n# Economic outlook\n\n# Economic environment\n\nThe forecast for real local gross domestic product growth in 2017 is expected to remain moderate. The Government predicts economic growth of between 2% and 3%, while private sector analysts forecast an average growth rate of 2.0%. Externally, as the global macroeconomic and financial environment becomes uncertain, global economic and trade growth may remain moderate; coupled with the rise in the Hong Kong dollar’s effective exchange rate due to a strong US dollar, this will suppress Hong Kong’s export performance. Locally, although stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, private consumption is expected to grow steadily, weighed down by rising interest rates. Benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of a number of infrastructure projects, building and construction activity should steadily increase, but a subdued business environment and increased interest rates will affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and labour markets\n\nIt is forecast that inflationary pressures will remain mild in 2017. On one hand, rising global commodity prices and increased (trend upward) in Mainland China’s inflation could lead to an increase in import prices; on the other hand, the strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar may contain the aforementioned pressures. With moderate economic momentum, local cost pressures remain contained, but due to the rise in new residential rental at the beginning of 2017, the inflation of the rental component in the Composite Consumer Price Index may pick-up in slightly. Market consensus predicts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, and the Government expects a basic inflation rate of 2.0%. Although heightened uncertainties may affect hiring intentions, private sector analysts forecast that the unemployment rate will maintain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nIn 2017, the economic outlook will be subject to numerous uncertainties, particularly from external factors. The uncertainty surrounding the new US administration’s policies will lead to a more uncertain global economic outlook, and potential protectionist policies could also bring resistance to global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries may also lead to asset market volatility and affect Hong Kong dollar fund flows. Furthermore, US interest rate normalisation will tighten local monetary conditions and put downward adjustment pressure on the real economy and asset prices; among them, the property market remains stretched, and the market outlook remains highly uncertain. In the short term, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and developers offering incentives (such as discounts and cash rebates) releasing accumulated purchasing power can all provide support for residential demand. On the other hand, new stamp duty measures, the potential for the US to quicken the pace of interest rate hikes, and steadily increasing housing supply may continue to bring resistance to the property market.\n\n# Banks’ performance\n\nDespite the Hong Kong economy faced with headwinds, coupled with unexpected outcomes from International political events causing increased market volatility, Hong Kong’s banking system remained sound in 2016. Authorised institutions’ capital and liquidity positions maintain good levels, asset quality slightly deteriorated, but remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nWith the US interest rates rising, Hong Kong interbank offered Rates (HIBORs) increased significantly in November and December. The composite interest rate reflecting the Hong Kong dollar funding costs of retail banks rose slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 Hong Kong interbank offered Rates (HIBORs), comprehensive interest rates and best lending rates.\n\nNote:\n1. Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) (monthly average) are announced by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.\n2. The best lending rate (monthly average) is referenced to the rate reported by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.\n\n# Profit trends\n\nRetail banking’s profit for 2016 improved slightly, with its Hong Kong business’s overall profit before tax growing by 8.7%. The growth was mainly driven by income from exchange and derivatives business (+39.7%), dividend income from subsidiaries (+123.5%) and net interest (+2.8%), although part of the growth was offset by a decrease in fee and commission income (-11.3%). Profit after tax for retail banking recorded an increase of 44.4%, with growth mainly coming from non-recurring items. The annualised rate of return on average assets for retail banking also rose to 1.44% from 1.04% in 2015 (Chart 8).\n\nFigure 8 retail banks’ performance\n\nIn 2016, the net interest rate for retail banks was 1.32%, the same level as in 2015 (Chart 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate remaining funds to financial investments with lower interest rates and higher liquidity, the decrease in interest income was offset by a decline in interest costs.\n\nFigure 9 Retail banking net interest margin\n\nRetail banking non-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total business income, remaining largely stable. Although fee and commission income fell by 11.3%, dividend income and exchange and derivatives business income rose by 123.5% and 39.7% respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

exchange rate remained stable in 2016. Hong Kong’s money market also continued to operate smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. The linked exchange rate system continues to demonstrate a high resilience to shocks, and is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# target\n\nThe primary target of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain Monetary stability, that is, to ensure exchange rate stability of the Hong Kong dollar, so that the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar in the foreign exchange markets are maintained within the range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. This monetary system mainly adopts a currency issuance System, stipulating that the US dollar Reserves held by the Exchange Fund provide at least 100 percent support to the Monetary Base; if there are changes in the Monetary Base, the US dollar Reserves must also be increased or decreased accordingly, fully matching the percentage change in the Monetary Base.\n\nMonetary Base (Chart 1) includes:\n- Liability certificates (providing full support for banknotes issued by three banks)\n- Government-issued circulating banknotes and coins\n- The aggregate balance of clearing accounts held by banks with the Monetary Authority (i.e., aggregate balance)\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government.\n\nChart 1 Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the automatic interest rate adjustment System and its firm commitment to honour the exchange guarantee. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side convertibility guarantee rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing the aggregate balance and decreasing Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby causing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return from the strong-side convertibility guarantee rate levels to the exchange range of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side convertibility guarantee rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, decreasing the aggregate balance and increasing Hong Kong dollar interest rates, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will then return from the weak-side convertibility guarantee rate levels to within the exchange range.\n\n# 2016 in 2016 Review\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced slight volatility in the first two months of 2016, after which it fluctuated narrowly for the remainder of the year. The Hong Kong dollar weakened significantly against the US dollar at the beginning of 2016, falling from 7.7510 on January 4 to 7.8196 on January 20 (Figure 1). This weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is consistent with the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, reflecting the widening interest rate differential between Hong Kong and the US after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2015. In addition, other market-related factors, including a sell-off in the Hong Kong stock market, less optimistic prospects for the economies of both the Mainland and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate, and overall weakness in Asian currencies, all contributed to reduced demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improved market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened slightly in February and has since fluctuated narrowly between 7.753 and 7.776 from March onwards, even remaining unaffected by the market volatility triggered by the UK Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Due to market expectations that the US would raise interest rates in the summer, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate experienced brief downward stress in May. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1 2016 markets exchange rates\n\nAs the exchange guarantee was not triggered, the total balance and total amount of outstanding exchange fund Bills and Notes remained largely unchanged in 2016, staying at around HK$12,222 billion (Chart 2). Throughout the year, the HKMA issued exchange fund Bills with a total value of HK$132 billion to meet the substantial demand from banks for liquidity management, causing the total balance to decrease to HK$259.6 billion at the end of 2016. The issuance of exchange fund Bills conforms to the Principles of the currency board system, as the issuance of exchange fund Bills is merely a transfer within the Monetary Base components, i.e., from the total balance to outstanding exchange fund Bills & Notes, and the Monetary Base remains fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2 2016 aggregate balance and outstanding exchange fund(s) Bills & Notes\n\n# Monetary markets\n\nHong Kong interbank interest rates remained at low levels for most of 2016 (Chart 3). Hong Kong interbank interest rates faced some upward stress in January and February due to increased financial market volatility, but turned stable in March as the financial environment regained calm. In the second and third quarters, despite market attention on the Brexit referendum outcome and US money market Fund reforms, Hong Kong interbank interest rates remained largely stable. Partly subject to year-end funding demand, and also the increase of Hong Kong dollar HIBORs catching up with US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong interbank interest rates recorded a significant increase in the fourth quarter. Despite this, short-term interbank interest rates largely maintained levels below the basic interest rate in 2016.\n\nIn accordance with the adjustment of the Federal Fund Rate target range in the US on December 14 (US time) from 0.25 to 0.50 to 0.50 to 0.75, the basic rate was adjusted upwards from 0.75 to 1.00 on December 15. The adjustment of the basic rate was made according to the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to the formula, the basic rate is set at the lower... bound of the US Federal Fund Rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average of the 5-day moving average of overnight and 1-month Hong Kong interbank offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3 2016 Hong Kong interbank offered Rates (HIBORs)\n\nHong Kong dollar forward exchange rates showed markedly premiums in January, largely following the movements of the Hong Kong dollar versus US dollar interest rate difference, as well as partially reflecting investors’ demand for foreign exchange hedging for their Hong Kong stock portfolios (Figure 4). Forward exchange rate premiums began to shrink in February. As market sentiments turned towards stability, Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate points remained largely stable from March to November, before rising again in December due to the contraction of the Hong Kong dollar versus US dollar interest rate difference. Overall, Hong Kong’s Monetary market operates smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity funds. Discount window lending was not active in 2016, involving only HK$5.3 billion.\n\n# Linked exchange rate system\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and even global financial shocks over the past few decades, the linked exchange rate system has been the cornerstone of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In early 2016, market volatility intensified, once again sparking commentary about a potential weakening of the Hong Kong dollar and comparisons to the Asian financial crisis. To facilitate greater understanding of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority explained the technical details to the public and pointed out that Hong Kong’s financial system has the resilience to withstand impacts. The Government also reaffirmed its firm commitment to maintaining the linked exchange rate system. Stability in the exchange and monetary markets further consolidated public confidence in the Government’s determination to maintain the linked exchange rate system and the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and preserving value. The International Monetary Fund, during its annual Fourth Article consultation with Hong Kong, explicitly stated that the linked exchange rate system is best suited to Hong Kong’s monetary regime, noting that Hong Kong’s flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserves Buffer, and sound and effective financial supervision are the backing of the linked exchange rate system.\n\nFigure 4 2016 US dollar to Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rates\n\nIn the light of a sound banking system’s key role in the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, the HKMA continues to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management as well as stress test outcome, and strengthens supervision of banks’ personal, corporate and mainland-related loans, to ensure the banking system possesses the ability to address shocks. Faced with the US monetary policy normalisation process, Hong Kong interbank interest rates have begun to rise. The HKMA reminds members of the public to stay vigilant and be well-prepared to meet potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, since October 1998, part of the Exchange Fund’s assets have been designated to provide support for the monetary base. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated narrowly between 106.3% and 107.5% in 2016, without triggering the upper or lower limit. The ratio was 106.7% on December 31, 2016 (Figure 5). Under the linked exchange rate system, although certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as backing the portfolio, all of the Exchange Fund’s assets can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources can provide strong backing for Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5 2016 support ratios daily change.\n\n# research work\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Currency Issuance Committee monitors and examines subjects related to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. In 2016, the subjects examined by the Currency Issuance Committee included the synchronicity of Hong Kong’s economic growth with that of China and the US, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and the financial Index conditions in Hong Kong. Records of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the monetary authority’s reports on the operation of the currency issuing system are all available on the HKMA website.\n\nHong Kong Financial Research Centre continues to support Monetary policy, the banking sector and financial research work. In 2016, the research centre collectively invited eighteen research fellows for visits and releases 20 working papers.\n\nThis year, the research center organized six international conferences and seminars, primarily including:\n- In January, it hosted the “7th China Economic Annual International Seminar,” with the theme “China’s Increasing Influence on the Global Economy.” During the seminar, eight research papers covering a wide range of issues were published, including China’s rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillovers from China, the impact of the Renminbi on the global and regional areas, and the trends and information flows of currency differentials.\n- In March, it jointly organized the “University and Keio University Exchange Rate and Macroeconomic Seminar” with Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Keio University, with content covering a number of different economic issues, including global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- In August, it co-organized the “Real Estate and Financial Stability Seminar” with City University of Hong Kong. The papers presented at the seminar covered age, population, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; movements in Hong Kong housing prices; housing affordability; the impact of mortgage regulations on housing decisions throughout the family life cycle; and the residential property market in mainland China.\n- In October, it jointly organized a seminar on the economic system of the Asia-Pacific region with the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, themed “Resilience of Regional Economic Systems in a Turbulent Global Environment.” The seminar attracted senior executives from a number of central banks, leading academics, and experts from international organizations and private institutions to engage in interactive roundtable discussions and share feedback on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system. The discussed issues covered a wide range, including financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, the spillover effects of China’s economic slowdown on other parts of the region, and the impact and prospects for potential growth in Asia.\n\nThe research Centre also organised the “14th Annual Summer Conference” in August, and held the “14th China Real Economy Conference” in September, to examine the asset quality of mainland banks and matters of financial stability. The above conferences and seminars attracted participants from academia, the financial services sector, and central banks from various regions. The research Centre also held 21 open small-scale workshops throughout the year, to discuss a wide range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Banknotes and coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of banknotes in circulation issued by banks was 407.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, increased by 13.2% compared to a year earlier (Chart 6, 7 and 8). The total value of banknotes and coins issued by the Government in circulation was 11.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, increased by 5.3% compared to a year earlier (Chart 9 and 10). Among the banknotes and coins issued by the Government, the total value of 10 Hong Kong dollar banknotes was 4.4 billion Hong Kong dollars, of them polymer banknotes accounted for 86%.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

Kong remains sound in 2016. The HKMA strengthened the risk governance framework and the effectiveness of credit and liquidity risk management systems of authorised institutions throughout the year. In the light of increasingly frequent cyber attacks, the HKMA also enhanced its supervision of authorised institutions’ technology risk management. To further its commitment to combating financial crime, the effectiveness of authorised institutions’ anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls remains a supervisory priority for the HKMA. Regarding the conduct of authorised institutions, the HKMA took concrete action to promote a customer-centric corporate culture and promote financial inclusion, and to cope with the difficulties faced by overseas SMEs and start-ups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its supervision of the practices of authorised institutions in the sale of investment and insurance products, to further enhance protection for customers.\n\nIn terms of supervisory policy, the HKMA has made significant progress in its preparations for the implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards in Hong Kong, including maintaining... stability of the net stable funding ratio, limits on large exposures, International Financial Reporting Standard 9, and the resolution framework under the “Financial Institutions (Resolution System) Ordinance”.\n\n# 2016 in 2016 Review\n\n# Regulatory work overview\n\nIn 2016, the HKMA conducted 188 off-site reviews covering a wide range of areas, including authorised institutions’ CAMEL rating, corporate governance, business operations and risk management. The HKMA strengthened its communication with the board of directors of authorised institutions to enhance risk governance and corporate culture in the banking sector. In addition to holding meetings with the board of directors or Board committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors (IneDs) to exchange feedback on corporate culture and risk governance matters. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with authorised institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the remuneration system of authorised institutions helped promote effective risk management.\n\nIn terms of capital adequacy levels, the HKMA reviews the capital plans of authorised institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, in order to be well-prepared for the full implementation of the Basel III capital Buffer in 2019. The stress testing of authorised institutions’ repayable capacity was also improved in accordance with the current macro economic environment. The HKMA also carefully assesses the recovery plans of major retail banks and provides comments on areas for improvement.\n\nIn addition to off-site review operations, the HKMA continued to conduct thematic assessments in conjunction with regular on-site inspections, with thematic assessments primarily applicable to categories assessed as high-risk. This regulatory approach allows the HKMA to more effectively allocate supervisory resources to cope with the various increased and major risks faced by authorised institutions. The HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site inspections and thematic assessments in 2016. The focus of these inspections and assessments remains credit risk management and controls, particularly concerning credit risk related to business within the Mainland; another focus is combating anti-money laundering and terrorist financing fund-raising measures. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and thematic assessments related to liquidity risk, operations risk, and technology risk management. During the year, a dedicated review team also conducted on-site inspections of authorised institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) related business.\n\nChart 1 containing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory work overview in 2016.\n\n# Credit risks regulation\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nbanks’ loan grew moderately in 2016. The total amount of outstanding loans increased by 6.5% for the whole year; the rate of change in 2015 was 3.5% (Chart 2). As customer deposit increases over loan increases, the overall lending rate decreased from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nChart 2: Growth of loans and advances.\n\nWithin the mainland, the total amount of related loans increased by 7% to 35,640 billion Hong Kong dollar(s) (Chart 3), including 545 billion Hong Kong dollar(s) in loans booked by subsidiaries of banks registered in Hong Kong.\n\nThe banking sector’s asset quality remained sound in 2016. Despite the specific classified loans ratio of retail banks rising slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained well below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the overall banking sector’s specific classified loans ratio rose from 0.73% to 0.85%. Within the year, the asset quality of mainland-related loans in the banking sector showed similar trends; during the same period, the specific classified loans ratio of these loans in retail banks rose slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, and the overall banking sector’s related ratio also rose slightly from 0.77% a year before to 0.80%.\n\nThe HKMA is investing significant supervisory resources to ensure authorised institutions continue to adopt prudent credit approval standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. The HKMA also pays special attention, during the supervisory process, to the increasing exposure of authorised institutions to risks associated with Chinese enterprises, as well as the credit risks arising from investments in debt securities to increase returns. In addition, the HKMA is conducting a thematic assessment of the credit risk management of authorised institutions distributing high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property mortgage loans\n\nThe HKMA continues to closely monitor property lending business of authorised institutions. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015, but then rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% for the whole year. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly granted residential mortgage loans decreased from 64% in September 2009, before the HKMA launched the first round of counter-cyclical mortgage measures, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio for newly granted residential mortgage loans also decreased from 41% in August 2010, when the debt-to-income ratio cap was first introduced, to 34% in December 2016 (Chart 1).\n\nChart 1: Average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt-to-income ratio for newly granted residential property loans\nBefore the HKMA launched counter-cyclical measures for first-time property loans, it introduced a debt-to-income ratio cap.\n\nAccording to the HKMA’s seventh round of countercyclical measures launched in February 2015, institutions authorised to use the internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk capital requirements must extend the application of the 15% credit risk weighting lower... limit from newly granted mortgage loans to the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This regulation took effect in June 2016.\n\nWithin the year, more real estate developers have directly provided loans to property buyers, and their loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is often higher than the levels permitted under the HKMA’s prudential requirements for authorised institutions. The HKMA closely monitors this development and communicates regularly with authorised institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage their exposure to real estate developers. In addition, the Land Registry, at the request of the HKMA, has agreed to provide e-tips services to authorised institutions. Authorised institutions using this service will receive electronic message issued by the Section when other mortgage documents for the properties on which they bear a charge are submitted to the Land Registry for registration. This service will help cope with situations where mortgage borrowers, without prior consent from the charging authorised institutions, independently obtain additional loans secured by the same property. The Land Registry launched the e-tips service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Regulation of business operations and technological risks.\n\nWith other international financial centre’s, Hong Kong is faced with Cybersecurity threats increasingly growing. The HKMA received reports from authorised institutions in 2016 regarding unauthorised equities trading and attempts to enter their payment systems, and immediately took operations to cope with the risks caused by these attacks. The HKMA issued e-banking service tips, reminding the public to beware of online stocks scams, and proposed the public take preventative measures. The HKMA also issued a notice to authorised institutions, providing guidance on security measures that could be taken to further advance online banking service controls. Regarding the case(s) of attempts to enter bank payment systems, the HKMA alerted authorised institutions when it first discovered related case(s) in Hong Kong, and explained the practices of these scams with the assistance of the police, and required authorised institutions to consider these practices when strengthening controls on payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the resilience of the banking system to cope with cyber risks, the HKMA launched the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative in May 2016. This programme consists of three pillars: a cybersecurity defense assessment framework, a professional talent development programme and a cyber risk information sharing platform (see the “Hong Kong’s International financial centre status” chapter, “Fintech Facilitation office” section for details). The HKMA issued a notice to authorised institutions in December, detailing the implementation timeline for the cybersecurity defense assessment framework.\n\nThe application of Fintech in the banking sector saw significant development in 2016, with a number of authorised institutions launching new Fintech products. Among these, the development of person-to-person small-value payments, contactless mobile payments and biometric authentication was particularly remarkable. The HKMA launched the “Fintech Regulatory Sandbox” in September, allowing authorised institutions to conduct pilot trials of their Fintech projects in a contained environment without needing to fully comply with the HKMA’s regulatory requirements. This arrangement allows authorised institutions to collect real data and user feedback early on, before the formal launch of Fintech services, so as to make appropriate amendments. As of the end of 2016, six applications for the use of the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox were approved, and the new Fintech products involved biometric authentication, securities trading and blockchain for mortgage valuation. The HKMA also adjusted upwards the transaction limit for online banking person-to-person small-value payment services that do not require dual authentication to HK$5,000 per account daily in November, to help cope with the increasing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nIn 2016, multiple incidents related to property fraud occurred, including fraudsters posing as property owners attempting to obtain benefits by applying for mortgage loans or the sale of the relevant properties. Although these incidents did not involve authorised institutions, the HKMA remained in close cooperation with the Police and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (banks’ Association) to provide guidance to authorised institutions on detecting and preventing these incidents within the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of “operations incident communications”, sharing lessons learned from operational incidents that had occurred in authorised institutions with the industry. The HKMA also conducted on-site reviews and thematic assessment of authorised institutions’ business operations risk management system, fraud management practices, trust\/custody business operations, and risk management and controls for preventing irregularities or unauthorised trading activities.\n\n# Treasury business and liquidity risk regulation.\n\nIn 2016, several major political events occurred, leading to markedly volatility in financial markets multiple times throughout the year. At the same time, US interest rates continued to normalisation slowly, and the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the Federal Fund rate in December, which was the second time since the global financial crisis. To be well-prepared to cope with these political events, the HKMA and overseas supervisory institutions continued to maintain close contact, and assess the impact of the events on the Hong Kong banking system, as well as requiring banks to stay vigilant and strengthen their risk management to deal with adverse market development.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk management, the HKMA conducted additional liquidity stress tests to evaluate the banking system’s ability to cope with potentially severe stress scenarios, and undertook follow-up actions with authorised institutions to further strengthen their resilience. Following a round of on-site examination of interest rate risk management in 2015, the HKMA conducted additional on-site reviews to assess the market risks management of authorised institutions, and required those institutions with insufficient controls to make corrections.\n\n# Combating anti-money laundering and the raising (of funds) for terrorist activities.\n\nThe HKMA’s risk-based anti-money laundering supervision includes on-site examination and off-site examination (including supervisory engagement with authorised institutions in respect of specific events), primarily aimed at areas with higher money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The examination content covers authorised institutions’ assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementation of risk-based approaches, and systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance. The HKMA’s professional supervisory staff conducted a total of 17 on-site examinations and 30 off-site examinations in 2016.\n\nIn terms of policy Development, the HKMA prioritises addressing the difficulties certain industries and person face in opening bank accounts, and issued guidelines with “Frequently Asked Questions” to clarify certain customer due diligence requirements, as well as the HKMA’s supervisory expectations for a risk-based approach. At the same time, the HKMA continues to cooperate closely with industry Association, issue guidelines to help authorised institutions handle certain categories of risks, such as trade-related anti-money laundering activities.\n"}

香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。去年的稅務修訂有助營造有利環境，吸引跨國公司在港設立企業財資中心。為發展香港成為基建融資中心與金融科技樞紐，金管局在年內成立基建融資促進辦公室及金融科技促進辦公室。年內金管局向儲值支付工具發行人批出13個牌照。香港穩健的財政表現及龐大的對外資產淨值，繼續獲得信貸評級機構確認，其中標準普爾維持對香港AAA的評級。\n\n# 概覽\n\n受到環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性影響，2016年全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。儘管如此，香港維持其作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，處理全球約七成人民幣支付交易。深港股票市場交易互聯互通機制「深港通」於12月推出，標誌着內地資本帳開放的另一里程碑，並且是提升香港的國際金融中心地位的重要一步。金管局亦透過擴大對市場的人民幣流動性支援及推出措施增加人民幣市場流動性的透明度，強化金融基建。\n\n金管局於7月成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，透過匯聚主要持份者促進基建發展，並發展香港成為基建融資中心。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴。年內金管局亦成功推動法例修訂的通過，以消除稅務不對稱及提供稅務優惠，鼓勵跨國及內地公司在香港設立企業財資中心，為金融及專業服務行業帶來更多商機。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構唯一設於阿布扎比以外的辦事處。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）在去年的第四條磋商討論中對我們致力鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位給予正面評價。年內金管局積極參與國際討論，致力推進全球與區內金融穩定。金管局亦與國際信貸評級機構保持緊密溝通，有關工作有助香港的信貸評級在2016年獲得主要信貸評級機構確認。\n\n香港金融基建的安全有效運作與持續發展，對鞏固香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭力發揮重要作用。處理銀行同業交易的4個即時支付結算(RTGS)系統及債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）在2016年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。\n\n金管局在2016年進一步加強香港的零售支付金融基建。年內根據2016年11月全面生效的《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）批出總共13個儲值支付工具牌照。電子支票服務涵蓋範圍亦已擴展至香港和廣東省（包括深圳）之間的跨境支付。\n\n為促進香港金融科技的發展，金管局於3月成立金融科技促進辦公室。年內實施的多項重要措施均取得理想進展。\n\n金管局推出一系列措施加強銀行業軟實力，包括(i)推出提升董事專業能力計劃；(ii)訂立整體業界的銀行從業員專業資歷架構；及(iii)推行消費者教育計劃。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 離岸人民幣業務\n\n2016年環球金融市場波動及人民幣匯率前景不確定性令全球離岸人民幣業務有所放緩。截至年底，香港人民幣客戶存款及存款證餘額合共為6,251億元人民幣，較上年減少38%（圖1）。年內離岸人民幣債券發行量降至528億元人民幣，經香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算額亦降至45,421億元人民幣。另一方面，香港銀行截至年底的人民幣貸款餘額為2,948億元人民幣，與上年相若（圖2）。人民幣RTGS系統的交易額維持於高位，於2016年平均每日處理的交易額為8,636億元人民幣。由此可見，儘管人民幣資金池有所縮減，但仍繼續支持大量人民幣金融中介活動在香港進行。根據環球銀行金融電信協會(SWIFT)統計數字，2016年香港處理約七成人民幣支付交易，足以證明香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n圖1 人民幣客戶存款及存款證\n\n圖2 人民幣融資活動\n\n年內金管局與內地有關當局緊密合作爭取更大政策空間，推展香港人民幣業務。年內推出多項新措施，包括進一步加大內地銀行間債券市場及外匯市場對外開放，以及在12月推出「深港通」。因應跨境投資渠道及市場對流動性管理需求增加，金管局擴大人民幣流動資金安排。於10月，金管局將一級流動性提供行的數目由7間增加至9間，有關計劃的總額度亦由140億元人民幣增加至180億元人民幣。金管局人民幣流動資金安排使用情況的透明度亦提高，有助參加行更有效管理流動資金。\n\n在3月公布的國家「十三五」規劃再次肯定香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，顯示中央政府支持香港進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續加強與其他經濟體的合作，發展離岸人民幣業務。金管局亦積極參加各類活動，推廣香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐及內地「走出去策略跳板的主要角色，包括參與業界組織及私營機構舉辦的本地活動，以及在中國內地、德國、哈薩克斯坦和英國等地的境外活動。\n\n# 內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排\n\n在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》框架下有關內地與香港基本實現服務貿易自由化的新協議，於2015年簽署。金管局繼續密切留意現行安排下的措施的實施情況，並與政府當局合作探討進步擴大內地市場對香港金融業的開放及便利措施。\n\n# 基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)\n\n# IFFO的使命\n\nIFFO的使命是透過匯聚主要持份者，共同促進基建投融資。IFFO的職能是：\n- 提供一個資訊交流和經驗分享的平台；\n- 提升基建投融資方面的技能和知識；\n- 推廣市場及產品發展；\n- 及促進基建投融資活動。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左七）於IFFO啟動儀式上聯同其他嘉賓祝酒。\n\n金管局於7月成立IFFO，其使命是透過匯聚主要持份者共同促進基建投融資。截至2017年1月底，已有超過60間來自中國內地、香港及海外的機構加入IFFO成為合作夥伴，當中包括多邊金融機構及發展銀行、公營機構投資者、私營機構投資者、資產管理公司、銀行、保險公司、基建項目發展及營運機構、專業服務公司及國際貿易協會（表1）。\n\nIFFO自成立以來取得良好進展。為致力提升技能，IFFO於10月聯同世界銀行集團旗下國際金融公司和瀚亞投資主辦行政人員工作坊，主題為「私營資金參與新興市場基建項目的投融資」。該工作坊獲得參與者非常正面的回應，有助增長知識及建立網絡。IFFO另於11月舉辦高層研討會，並邀請亞洲基礎設施投資銀行行長金立群先生主講及分享基建項目規劃、營運與管理的經驗。於7月，IFFO分別與國際金融公司及全球基礎設施中心簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，建立合作框架。另於12月分別與國家開發銀行及中國進出口銀行簽訂《諒解備忘錄》，透過IFFO平台促進該兩間銀行的基建項目融資。這些活動有助加強香港作為基建融資中心的地位及國際形象。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與國際金融公司執行副總裁兼首席執行官菲利普• 勒奧魯先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，促成兩者合作利用IFFO平台，為區內基建投融資營造更有效率及有利的市場環境。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（前左）與全球基礎設施中心首席執行官Chris Heathcote先生（前右）簽署《諒解備忘錄》，建立策略性合作框架，促進基建項目融資。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）與國家開發銀行董事長胡懷邦先生簽署《諒解備忘錄》，加強該行與金管局的合作。\n\n# 企業財資中心\n\n為進一步吸引跨國公司在香港設立企業財資中心，金管局與政府當局合作，營造一個對企業財資中心有利的稅務環境。具體上，《2016年稅務（修訂）（第2號）條例》（《修訂條例》）於6月通過，容許企業在符合指明條件下，在計算利得稅時可獲扣減經營集團內部融資業務的利息支出，以及就合資格企業財資中心指明財資業務的利潤，寬減利得稅百分之五十（即降至8.25%）。表2簡載《修訂條例》部分要點：\n\n除立法工作外，金管局亦積極向跨國和內地企業推廣在香港設立企業財資中心的優勢。截至年底，金管局已接觸近400間公司、金融機構及行業組織。金管局亦於11月與香港中國企業協會簽署《諒解備忘錄》，協助香港的中資企業進一步了解及更多利用我們的企業財資中心平台。\n\n# 推廣資產管理業務\n\n金管局繼續致力推廣香港作為資產管理中心。根據證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），從事資產管理的持牌法團數目於2016年底為1,300間，按年增加近15%。根據《亞洲創業投資期刊》，2016年在香港的私募基金公司（包括證監會持牌法團及非證監會持牌法團）數目亦增加4.6%，至431間。迄今全球百大資產管理公司中有接近70間，以及內地二十大互惠基金公司中的大多數，已在香港設有業務或相聯公司。在香港駐設業務的機構投資者數目亦逐漸增加，其中作為全球第三大主權基金的阿布扎比投資局於10月宣布在香港成立海外辦事處，是該機構於阿布扎比以外設立的唯一辦事處。\n\n# 引入開放式基金型公司結構\n\n為吸引基金來港註冊，金管局繼續與政府及業界合作，營造更有利的稅務及監管環境。於6月，《2016年證券及期貨（修訂）條例草案》獲得通過，引入開放式基金型公司結構，令香港的基金註冊平台更多元化，並為基金經理營造更靈活的經營環境，從而加強香港作為國際資產管理中心的競爭力。\n\n# 伊斯蘭金融\n\n金管局繼續致力增加市場對伊斯蘭金融的認識和了解，包括聯同業界公會舉辦及參與伊斯蘭金融研討會及講座，並與市場參與者分享有關發行伊斯蘭債券的經驗，鼓勵它們使用香港的平台。繼成功發行上兩批伊斯蘭債券後，金管局與政府一直緊密合作，在市場條件合適時推出第三批伊斯蘭債券。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

offshore renminbi business. Last year’s tax amendment helped foster a conducive environment, attracting multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. To develop Hong Kong as an Infrastructure financing centre and a Fintech Hub, the HKMA established the Facilitation office for Infrastructure Financing and the Facilitation office for Fintech within the year. The HKMA granted 13 licences to stored value payment facilities issuers during the year. Hong Kong’s sound financial performance and large net external asset position continue to receive recognition from credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its AA+ rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nAffected by global financial market volatility and uncertainty in the Renminbi exchange rate prospects, global offshore Renminbi business slowed in 2016. Despite this, Hong Kong remains the hub for offshore Renminbi business, handling about 70% of global Renminbi payment transactions. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme launched in December, marking another milestone in the opening of the mainland capital account and is a further step in enhancing Hong Kong’s international financial centre position. The HKMA also strengthened financial infrastructure through expanding support for liquidity in the Renminbi market and launching measures to increase transparency of Renminbi liquidity.\n\nThe HKMA established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development by bringing together key stakeholders and to develop Hong Kong as a hub for infrastructure financing. As of January 31, 2017, over 60 institutions had joined the IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully promoted the passage of legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetry and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and Mainland companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, bringing more business opportunities to the financial and professional services industries. The number of institutions with a presence in Hong Kong also gradually increased, with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third largest sovereign fund, announcing in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong – the only office the institution has set up outside Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a positive assessment of our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre during last year’s Fourth Article discussion. Within the year, the HKMA actively participated in international discussion, and continued to advance global and regional financial stability. The HKMA also maintained close communications with international credit rating agencies, and this work helped Hong Kong’s credit rating obtain recognition from major credit rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe and effective operation and continued Development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure plays an important role in consolidating Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and global hub for offshore renminbi business. The four Real time gross Settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) system for debt instruments achieved 100% system availability in 2016, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nIn 2016, the HKMA further strengthened Hong Kong’s retail payment infrastructure. During the year, a total of 13 stored value facilities licences were granted under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”) which came into force in November 2016. The coverage of e-cheque services has also been expanded to cover cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, including Shenzhen.\n\nTo promote the Development of financial technology in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation office in March. Several important measures implemented within the year have all achieved satisfactory progress.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has launched a series of measures to enhance the banking sector’s soft power, including (i) launching a programme to enhance directors’ professional ability; (ii) establishing an overall industry banking practitioner professional qualifications framework; and (iii) implementing a consumer education plan.\n\n# 2016 in 2016 Review\n\n# Offshore Renminbi business\n\nIn 2016, global financial market volatility and uncertainty regarding the Renminbi exchange rate outlook led to a moderation in global offshore Renminbi business. As of year-end, the combined balance of Renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit in Hong Kong amounted to RMB625.1 billion, a 38% decrease compared to a year earlier (Figure 1). The issuance of offshore Renminbi bonds decreased to RMB52.8 billion during the year, and the settlement amount of Renminbi trade processed by Hong Kong banks also declined to RMB4,542.1 billion. On the other hand, the outstanding balance of Renminbi loans at Hong Kong banks as of year-end remained similar to the previous year (Figure 2), at RMB294.8 billion. The transaction volume of the Renminbi RTGS system remained at a high level, with an average daily processing volume of RMB863.6 billion in 2016. This demonstrates that despite a reduction in the Renminbi funding pool, it still continues to support a large volume of Renminbi financial intermediation activities in Hong Kong. According to statistics from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of Renminbi payment transactions in 2016, which is sufficient proof of Hong Kong’s position as a hub for offshore Renminbi business.\n\nFigure 1 RMB customer deposits and certificates of deposit.\n\nFigure 2 RMB financing activities\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA closely cooperated with relevant authorities on the Mainland to strive for greater policy space and promote Renminbi business in Hong Kong. Several new measures were launched during the year, including further liberalisation of access to the Mainland’s interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, as well as the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in December. In accordance with increasing demand for cross-border investment channels and liquidity management, the HKMA expanded the Renminbi Liquidity Facility. In October, the HKMA increased the number of Primary liquidity providing banks from seven to nine, and the total facility size was also increased from RMB14 billion to RMB18 billion. The transparency of the usage of the HKMA’s Renminbi Liquidity Facility was also enhanced, which helped participating banks more effectively manage funds.\n\nThe national “13th Five-Year Plan” announced in March affirmed Hong Kong’s position as a global hub for offshore renminbi business, demonstrating the central Government’s support for Hong Kong to further develop offshore renminbi business.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies to develop offshore Renminbi business. The HKMA also actively participates in various activities to promote Hong Kong’s key role as a global hub for offshore Renminbi business and a springboard for China’s “going out” strategy, including participating in industry participants and private institutions organising local activities, as well as overseas activities in China, Germany, Kazakhstan and the UK.\n\n# Arrangements in relation to establishing more close economic and trade relationship with Hong Kong and the mainland.\n\nUnder the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong on establishing more close economic and trade relationship, a new agreement on substantially achieving liberalization of trade in services between the Mainland and Hong Kong was signed in 2015. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation situation of the measures under the existing arrangements, and with the Government Administration cooperation explore further leveraging on the opening and facilitating measures of the Mainland markets to the Hong Kong of the industry.\n\n# Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO)\n\n# IFFO’s mission\n\nIFFO’s mission is to promote infrastructure investment and financing through exchange of key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions are:\n- providing a platform for information exchange and sharing of experience;\n- enhance skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;\n- promote market and products development;\n- and promote infrastructure investment and financing events.\n\nThe HKMA Chief Executive Norman T.L. Chan (seventh from the left) proposed a toast with other guests at the IFFO launching ceremony.\n\nThe HKMA established IFFO in July, with the mission to promote infrastructure investment and financing through bringing together key stakeholders. As of January 31, 2017, over 60 institutions from Mainland China, Hong Kong and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, public institutional investors, private institutional investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project development and operating companies, professional service companies and international trade associations (Chart 1).\n\nIFFO has achieved positive progress since its establishment. Dedicated to enhancing skills, IFFO, in October, co-organised a workshop with the International Finance Corporation, under the World Bank Group, and Eastspring Investments, focusing on “investment and financing for private participation in infrastructure projects in emerging markets”. The workshop received very positive feedback from participants, helping to increase knowledge and build a network. IFFO also organised a high-level seminar in November, inviting Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to speak and share his experience in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed Memorandums of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Hub respectively, establishing a cooperation framework. Furthermore, in December, it signed Memorandums of Understanding with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China respectively, promoting infrastructure project financing for the two banks through the IFFO platform. These activities help strengthen Hong Kong’s position and international image as a hub for infrastructure financing.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Norman Chan (front left) and International Finance Corporation Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer Philippe Le Houérou (front right) signs a Memorandums of Understanding, fostering cooperation between the two to leverage the IFFO platform, to foster a more efficient and conducive environment for regional infrastructure investment and financing markets.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Norman T.L. Chan (front left), and the Chief Executive Officer of the Global Infrastructure Hub, Chris Heathcote (front right), signs a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework and promote infrastructure project financing.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Norman Chan (left) signs a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chairman of the national development bank, Hu Huibang, to strengthen cooperation between AIIB and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n# Companies treasury center\n\nTo further attract multinational companies to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government collaborated to foster a tax environment conducive to corporate treasury centres. Specifically, the “2016 Taxation (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance” (“the Amended Ordinance”) was passed in June, allowing companies, under specified conditions, to obtain a deduction of interest expenses on financing business within their operating group when calculating profits tax, as well as tax reductions of 50% (i.e. reduced to 8.25%) on profits from specified treasury business of eligible corporate treasury centres. Chart 2 briefly outlines key points of the Amended Ordinance.\n\nIn addition to legislative work, the HKMA is also actively promoting the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to multinational and Chinese companies. As at year-end, the HKMA have reached out to nearly 400 companies, financial institutions and industry organisations. The HKMA also signed Memorandums of Understanding with the Chinese Enterprises Association in Hong Kong in November, to assist Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong to further understand and more leverage our corporate treasury centre platform.\n\n# Promote asset management business\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to be dedicated to promoting Hong Kong as a management centre. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management was 1,300 at the end of 2016, an increase of nearly 15% year on year. According to Asian Venture Capital Journal, the number of private equity fund companies in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed corporations and non-SFC-licensed corporations) also increased by 4.6% in 2016, to 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world’s top 100 asset management companies, as well as the majority of the top 20 mutual fund companies in Mainland China, have established operations or associated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with a presence in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing, with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third largest sovereign wealth fund, announcing in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, the only office established by the institution outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introducing an open-ended fund company structure.\n\nTo attract Fund(s) to register in Hong Kong, the HKMA continues to cooperate with the Government and industry, fostering a more conducive tax and regulatory environment. In June, the “Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill 2016” was passed, introducing an open-ended fund company structure, making Hong Kong’s fund registration platform more diversified, and fostering a more flexible operating environment for fund managers, thereby enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an International asset management centre.\n\n# Islamic Finance\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to be dedicated to increasing market understanding of Islamic finance, including organising and participating in Islamic finance seminars and lectures with industry associations, and sharing experience with market participants regarding the issuance of Islamic bonds, to encourage them to use Hong Kong’s platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two batches of Islamic bonds, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been working closely with the Government to launch the third batch of Islamic bonds when market conditions are appropriate.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖

experiencing large volatility and turbulence. Early in the year, market sentiments worried about a hard landing of the Chinese economy and a slowdown in global growth, prompting a remarkably large fall in global stock markets. The UK Brexit referendum in June and the US election outcome in November were also unexpected. Despite a difficult investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has already taken a series of defensive measures over the years to enhance the resilience of the Exchange Fund, and as a result, the Exchange Fund still recorded 2% overall investment return in 2016.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary purpose of the Exchange Fund is to influence the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate directly or indirectly, and may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s Monetary and financial system, thereby maintaining Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary, and invests in securities or other assets deemed appropriate following consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Exchange Fund Management\n\n# Investment target and portfolio composition.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee developed the following investment targets for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) Protect capital;\n(b) Ensure the overall Monetary Base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) Ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain currency and financial stability; and\n(d) To achieve investment return to the extent possible, while complying with the above (a) to (c) items, to preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThe above targets fully consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and have already been reflected in the Exchange Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: a support portfolio and an investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full support for the Monetary Base as stipulated by the monetary authority system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in the bond markets and equities of member economies of the Cooperation and Development (in OECD), to protect the value and long-term purchasing power of assets. The overall long-term target allocation mix of bonds and equities between these two portfolios is 71 to 29. In terms of target currency weight, 91% of assets are allocated to US dollar and Hong Kong dollar, with the remaining 9% allocated to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term investment return, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is diversifying a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a more diversified range of asset classes in a prudent and gradual manner, including emerging markets and local bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas property investments. Emerging markets and local bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, whereas investments in private equity and real estate are held by the long-term growth portfolio. The market value cap for the long-term growth portfolio is one-third of the cumulative surplus of the Exchange Fund, but there is still room for increase as some Future funds are allocated to long-term assets.\n\nStrategic asset portfolios were established in 2007 to hold shares of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government for strategic purposes as Exchange Fund accounts. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its investment performance assessment does not include it.\n\n# On deposits in the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe Exchange Fund periodically received deposits from fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory organisations, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the portfolio 2, but this does not apply to Future Fund deposits. The interest rates on Future Fund deposits are linked to the performance of both the portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with actual rates depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2016, the Future Fund’s mix between the portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment procedures\n\nThe investment procedures of the Exchange Fund are based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation refers to the asset allocation reflected by the investment benchmark, indicating the best long-term asset allocation that the Exchange Fund can achieve to reach its investment target. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as guidance to strategically allocate assets, in order to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark. Therefore, the actual allocation will often deviate from the benchmark allocation (also known as strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is known as “tactical deviations”. The Financial Secretary, following consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, developed the investment benchmark and the limits of tactical deviations. The HKMA is authorized to determine the strategic asset allocation. Investment managers can select holdings within the limits of tactical deviations to achieve gains from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA Reserves Management Department staff directly manage approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire support portfolio and part of the investment portfolios. This portion of the investment portfolios invests in global fixed income markets and implements the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategy through derivatives.\n\n# External investment managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets through in-house personnel Management, the HKMA also employs external investment managers responsible for managing approximately 26% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equities portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to utilize the best professional investment solutions in the market for Exchange Fund investments, and to allow the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified investment methods, as well as to enable in-house professional staff to acquire market knowledge and information.\n\nExpenses related to employing external investment managers includes Fund management and custody fees, trading fees, withholding tax and other taxation. These expenses are mainly subject to market factors and vary annually.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)’s publication on March 7, 2016 of the “Principles of Responsible Ownership” (the “Principles”). The Principles are voluntary in nature and aim to assist investors in determining how to best fulfill their ownership responsibilities in relation to investments in companies listed in Hong Kong. Regarding the management of the Exchange Fund, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages externally appointed fund managers responsible for managing Hong Kong equities portfolios to adopt the Principles when managing these investments.\n\n# Risk Management and oversight\n\nIn recent years, financial markets have experienced significant volatility, highlighting the importance of risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority establishes stringent control measures and investment guidelines for portfolios managed by both in-house and external managers, and closely monitors compliance with the guidelines and regulations. Additionally, it adopts risk management tools to assess market risks under normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also conducts detailed analyses of investment performance factors, striving to most effectively leverage on the investment management technology of both in-house and external managers.\n\n# The performance of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# The financial markets in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, global financial markets experienced large volatility and turbulence. Regarding the stock market, in January, concerns about a hard landing of the Chinese economy and a slowdown in global growth led to a marked fall in Hong Kong and other major stock markets, until the market stabilised by mid-February. The UK Brexit referendum in June and the US election outcome in November came as surprises in succession, but equities quickly recouped some ground after a brief fall. Overall, global stock markets performed well throughout the year.\n\nIn the bond markets, further declines in commodity prices in the first quarter deepened market concerns about slowing global growth and low inflation. Coupled with the uncertainty brought about by the Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations that central banks would maintain loose policies, this increased demand for safe-haven assets, providing support for government bond markets to deliver solid performance in the first half of 2016. Among these, the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes fell to a record low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, as expectations for US interest rate hikes increased, particularly after the US presidential election, US Treasury yields surged. Yields on other major government bonds also increased, but the increase was smaller.\n\nIn the monetary markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the US dollar exchange rate Index climbing to a 14-year high. The continued strength of the US dollar was supported by the widening difference in interest rates with other major currencies. Although the Japanese yen rose approximately 3% against the US dollar in 2016, the euro fell approximately 3% against the US dollar. Faced with ongoing uncertainties brought about by the Brexit referendum outcome, the pound also fell 16% against the US dollar during the year, its largest drop since 2008.\n\nChart 1 lists the performance of major currencies, the debt market, and the stock market in 2016.\n\nChart 1 2016 markets investment return\nStock market performance is calculated based on the Average prices change within the year.\n\n# The performance of the Exchange Fund.\n\nDespite turbulent financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded HK$68.1 billion in investment income in 2016, including income from overseas equities of HK$28.6 billion, Hong Kong equities of HK$5.3 billion, bonds of HK$33.1 billion, and other investment income held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries of HK$16.9 billion, as well as a negative currency translation effect of HK$15.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets. As the US dollar exchange rate rose sharply last year, a translation effect was unavoidable when the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments were translated into Hong Kong dollars. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HK$700 million.\n\nIn 2016 at year-end, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached 36,187 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total market value of long-term growth portfolio investments amounted to 181.8 billion Hong Kong dollars, including 116.8 billion Hong Kong dollars in private equity and 65 billion Hong Kong dollars in real estate; the total amount committed but not yet drawn for investments was 133.8 billion Hong Kong dollars.\n\nDespite challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieved a 2% investment return in 2016 (excluding Strategic asset portfolios). The long-term growth portfolio has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of about 12% since investment activities commenced in 2009.\n\nDue to the continuing deterioration of the external investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has already implemented a series of defensive deployments over the years, including shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and markedly reducing independent US dollar and Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also quickens the pace of diversification investments, especially long-term growth portfolio investments. These deployments have greatly enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rate of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Chart 2 shows the investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2016 and the average investment return for different durations. The average return of the Exchange Fund over the past three years was 0.9%, over the past five years was 2.0%, over the past ten years was 2.6%, and since 1994 was 4.8%.

through media, public education programmes and other various channels, to facilitate public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations. This year, the HKMA will continue to strengthen corporate governance, including supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing Fintech security, to help cope with the challenges brought by the implementation of new measures and increasing work complexity.\n\n# Maintaining contact with the public and the development of institutions.\n\n# Public Communication\n\nThe HKMA maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and facilitate public understanding of its policies and work. The HKMA held a total of 81 public media programmes in 2016, including 14 press conferences, 13 stand-up interviews and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. A total of 326 bilingual press releases were published throughout the year, and a large number of media enquiries are handled daily.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established two important offices, namely the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO). To elaborate on the Functions and work programme of both, the HKMA undertakes several public media projects. In addition, the HKMA organizes media briefings and seminars to deepen public understanding of the HKMA’s operation and measures in areas such as financial inclusion, Reserves management, Fintech regulatory sandbox, Cybersecurity and sMe Financing.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Norman T.L. Chan meets with reporters at the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ annual Beijing trip in 2016.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe public enquiry service provides an effective channel for members of the public to enquire about the HKMA’s Functions and work information. This service handled 10,170 enquiries in 2016, an increase of 12% compared to 2015. Approximately half of the enquiries related to banking sector policies and regulation, monetary and economic matters, and banking consumer issues, especially banking products and services, coin collection programmes, banking industry related guidance and notices, stored value payment facilities and retail payment systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing activities, as well as the prudent supervision of mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public enquiries received each year since 2013, and Figure 2 lists the proportion accounted for by various types of enquiries in 2016.\n\n# Publication\n\nIn addition to the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Monetary and Financial Stability Situation Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin within the year, and regularly updates the monthly Financial Statistics Source, providing the latest and thematic information and analyses regarding Hong Kong’s currency, banking sector and economic affairs. Furthermore, the HKMA released a total of 32 “Exchange of Views” articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 in 2015, elaborating on a number of thematic matters related to the HKMA’s work.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2016 received a Silver award in the Best Annual Report Awards 2016 organized by the Hong Kong Management Association in the “non-profit and charitable institutions” category.\n\n# public education programme\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre is located on the 55th floor of International financial centre Tower 2, introducing the work of the HKMA and enhancing public understanding of Monetary and banking sector affairs. The Information Centre consists of exhibitions and a library, and is open to the public for visits six days a week. The exhibition hall introduces the work of the HKMA, as well as the development of Hong Kong’s money and banking sector; additionally, reading information and exhibits are provided for the study of Hong Kong’s money, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe information center’s policy exhibitions, which explain the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work and introduce related financial knowledge, underwent renovation work in the fourth quarter of 2016, enhancing the exhibition content and adding a variety of interactions. Especially, interactive games that combine learning with play have been added to explain financial concepts in an accessible way. There are also visually appealing touch screen displays that provide a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work, aiming to provide visitors with a completely new visit experience. In addition, the renovated information center also features a mosaic work of Victoria Harbour, created with over 130,000 Hong Kong coins. The new policy exhibition area has already been reopened to the public on February 24, 2017.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority website\n\nThe HKMA’s institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and Traditional and Simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest information from the HKMA. The website also contains the “Register of Securities Business Employees of Authorised Institutions” and the “Register of Authorised Institutions and Local Representatives’ offices” maintained under Section 20 of the “banking Ordinance”, as well as the “Register of Licensed Stored Value Facilities” maintained under the “Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance”. The website features thematic webpages and prominent quick links to remind the public of the HKMA’s latest measures, such as the regulatory regime for stored value payment tools, IFFO and FFO, and important and timely matters, such as preventing telephone scams and the locations of coin collection scheme cashiers.\n\nThe completely new image of the information center’s policy exhibition area.\n\nA mosaic artwork of Victoria Harbour scenery is created using Hong Kong coins.\n\nThe information center provides guided tours for visitors. Within the year, the information center received over 56,200 persons and provided more than 580 times of guided tours for schools and other groups (Figure 3). Since it opened in December 2003, the cumulative total number of visitors to the information center has exceeded 586,600 times.\n\nThe library adjacent to the show houses over 23,000 books, periodicals and other publications for research on subjects such as Hong Kong currency, the banking sector, finance and central banking affairs. The library also maintained the e-Register of authorised institutions and local representative offices and authorised securities business personnel as stipulated in Article 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo maintain contact with the community and facilitate public understanding of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA continues to organise public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA organised 3 open lectures, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers to participate, with topics including the linked exchange rate system, banking system stability, Hong Kong banknotes, smart tips for using banking related products and services, and the deposit protection scheme. Education seminars have attracted over 56,400 members of the public to participate since their launch in 98.\n\nStudents and teachers from various districts attended one of the public education seminars.\n\nFigure 3: Group categories visiting the information center in 2016.\n\n# Human resources\n\nThe HKMA hires, provides talent development for, and maintains a professional and excellent staff, in order to fulfill policy targets and flexibly address changes in work priorities. The HKMA is part of the Government framework, but employs staff under independent employment terms, attracting talent with appropriate experience and professional knowledge. As a corporate institution, the HKMA is committed to maintaining a streamlined, flexible organisation structure, and strives to implement new measures and meet increasing workloads through the allocation of existing staffing as much as possible.\n\n# Staffing establishment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s staffing establishment was 875 people in early in the year 2016, and 12 posts were added in the second half of 2016 to perform the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s supervisory functions under the new Insurance regulatory regime. Therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s staffing establishment at the end of 2016 was 887 people.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for the implementation of new legislation and policies, continued advancement of ongoing pilot trials, and handling of increasingly complex and heavy workloads, the HKMA’s overall staffing increased by 40 to 927 in 2017 (a growth of 4.5%). The new posts are responsible for executing the following functions:\n- Promoting the stability of banks and the financial system, including:\n    - Strengthening supervisory capacity to manage the increasing technology risks of banks and new Fintech projects, as well as responding to the expansion of banks in the region and their business;\n    - Strengthening the supervision and enforcement work to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and preparing for the 2018 Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation;\n    - Being well-prepared for the implementation of the “Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance” to address the “too big to fail” issue in the financial industry in accordance with international standards; and\n    - Strengthening supervisory capacity to align with new international standards on capital and market risks, and allocating more resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support in response to the increased investment work involved in further promoting the diversification of Exchange Fund investment products, while enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment procedures to cope with the increasingly challenging investment environment.\n- Developing and implementing talent development programmes and strengthening related resources to ensure the HKMA possesses the necessary human resources to respond to market developments and future challenges.\n- Strengthening research in monetary policy and the processing of monetary statistics, as well as providing resources to handle enquiries and complaints made regarding the licensing\/designation and related supervision of stored value payment facilities and retail payment systems.\n\nChart 1 lists the staffing and actual number of personnel by Department of the HKMA as of January 1, 2017.\nChart 1 2017 January 1 HKMA position establishment and actual personnel number.\n\nThe HKMA transfers staff to help cope with other work and deploys staff to International or local institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in projects or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA participated. In addition, the HKMA deploys staff to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Committee and the Treasury Markets Association to provide full-time or assist in operation support.\n\n# Remuneration and benefits policies and salary review system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, listens to the comments provided by the committees under its governance, and with reference to market remuneration levels and practices, determines the salary and conditions of service for Hong Kong Monetary Authority staff. The remuneration portfolio includes cash salary and provident fund, and also establishes some basic benefits. Cash salary includes fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a variable salary issued annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary will, when reviewing the remuneration of Hong Kong Monetary Authority staff each year, seek advice from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, listening to the proposals of the corporate governance committee under its purview, and considering the corporate governance committee’s assessment of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s performance over the past year, the results of salary surveys of the financial industry conducted by independent human resources consultants, and other relevant factors. The pay of individual employees with outstanding work performance may also be subject to special adjustments, in order to maintain their salary competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority allocates funds approved for annual fixed salary adjustments or the issuance of variable pay based on individual employee performance; and the variable pay system for professional investment personnel is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to the fixed salary or issuance of variable pay for assistant directors or above are approved by the Financial Secretary, after consulting the opinions of the governance Committee, and the relevant employees will recuse themselves when their remuneration proposals are discussed at meetings. Adjustments to the fixed salary or issuance of variable pay for officers and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, based on the authorization of the Financial Secretary, and in accordance with the total funds approved for salary payments.\n\n# Top executives remuneration.\n\nChart 2 lists the salary information of top executives in 2016.\n\n1. In addition to accrued annual leave, the actual salary of employees with less than 1 year of service will be annualized to derive the annualised average salary for that grade. 2.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 香港特別行政區政府審昇計毐署\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第149至237頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而公平地反映外匯基金及集團於2016年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》 （第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","terms":{"進":["enter","go","proceed","capitalising

Planning Office\n\n# Independent Auditors’ Report to the Financial Secretary (FS)\n\n# feedback\n\nWe certify that we have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 149 to 237, which comprise the statement of financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and the statement of income, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the accounting policies and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI believe that these financial statements have already been prepared, in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to truly and fairly reflect the financial positions of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year ended that date, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# The basis of feedback.\n\nI have already conducted the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the “Exchange Ordinance” and the auditing standards of the Auditors. My responsibilities under those standards, as detailed in the “Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of this Report, are set out. In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group, and I have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is adequate and provides a suitable basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are of most importance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. I have addressed these matters in my audit of the overall financial statements and in forming my opinion, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Audit Office Report (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow should I handle related matters during the audit?\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nPlease refer to the notes 2.5, 2.6 and 36.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value totaled 31,989.75 billion Hong Kong dollar, and financial liabilities totaled 9,639.77 billion Hong Kong dollar.\n\n95% of these financial assets and the fair value of all these financial liabilities are the same as assets or liabilities quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs), or estimated using valuation methods, with parameters based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation methods, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). The total valuation of these financial assets is HK$175.886 billion, including primarily independent investment fund(s).\n\nIn the light of the large amount involved and the estimations involved, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value are key audit matters.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n- Understand the valuation programmes for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related controls;\n- Evaluate and test controls, including related programme controls for computer systems;\n- Obtain confirmation regarding the valuation, existence, ownership and responsibilities, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- If market prices are used, verify prices from independent Sources;\n- If the parameters of the valuation methods used are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation methods are best and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters from independent Sources; and\n- If the parameters of the valuation methods used are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation methods are suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Future Fund deposits\n\nPlease refer to the financial statements notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23 and twenty-eight.\n\nIn previous years, the vast majority of deposits in the financial reserves had to be repaid upon request, and interest was calculated at a fixed rate determined by the past investment return of the reference portfolios.\n\nThe Government established the Future Fund within the Financial Reserves in 2016 on January 1. The Future Fund deposits comprise the first funds from the Land Fund surplus (amounting to HK$219.73 billion) and regular injections from the Government’s general revenue account (the amount of which is directed by the Financial Secretary). The interest on the Future Fund deposits is calculated on a composite rate, which is referenced to the fixed rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, as mentioned above, and the annualised rate of return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and real estate investments), determined on an annualised average basis. Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the deposits of the Future Fund, together with the interest earned, should be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Future Fund’s deposits totaled 224.53 billion Hong Kong dollars. The cumulative interest earned on these deposits was 10.071 billion Hong Kong dollars. Due to the large amount involved and significant changes in deposit conditions, special attention should be paid to the measurement, presentation manner, and disclosure information regarding the deposits and the interest earned.\n\nRegarding Future Fund placements, audit procedures include:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies used to measure the related placements and earned interest are appropriate;\n- Reviewing the methods for calculating the annual rate of return linked with the performance of long-term growth portfolios;\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed rate determined based on the past performance of reference portfolios, the annual rate of return linked with the performance of long-term growth portfolios, and the comprehensive rate determined based on these two rates;\n- Verifying the amount of accrued interest calculated using the comprehensive rate; and\n- Reviewing the manner of presentation and disclosure information of the related placements and earned interest in the financial statements.\n\n# Fair value accounting for investment properties valuation.\n\nPlease refer to the notes 2.12, 17 and eighteen to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value, and were valued at HK$22.723 billion as at December 31, 2016. The Group also has ownership interests in three associated companies and 14 joint ventures, whose primary business is holding overseas investment properties, with a total value of HK$32.083 billion. Whether held directly by the Group or by associated companies or joint ventures, the fair value of these investment properties is mainly determined based on the valuation by independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nRegarding the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value, audit procedures include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports of investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associated companies or joint ventures, and verifying that fair value is determined based on the valuation as stated in the relevant valuation report;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluating whether the valuation methods are suitable, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Sources\n\nThe financial management professional is responsible for other information. Other information includes all information within the monetary authority’s 2016 Annual Report, but does not include financial statements and my auditors’ Report.\n\nMy feedback on the financial statements does not cover other information, and I also do not release any form of attestation conclusions regarding other information.\n\nRegarding the audit of the financial statements, I have the responsibility to read other information, in order to consider whether other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or circumstances I have learned during the audit process, or appears to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have carried out, if I believe other information contains material misstatements, I need to Report that fact. In this regard, I have no Report.\n\n# The responsibilities undertaken by the financial management professional and the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund Committee with respect to financial statements.\n\nThe financial management specialist is responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ promulgated *Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards* and the instructions issued by the Chief Executive under Article 7 of the *Exchange Ordinance*, and for implementing the internal controls it deems necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or errors.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, the financial management professional is responsible for assessing the Group’s continuing ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to continuing operations where applicable, and using a going concern basis for accounting.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee’s Audit Sub-Committee is responsible for supervising the Group’s financial report process.\n\n# Responsibilities of auditors regarding the audit of financial statements.\n\nMy target is to obtain reasonable guarantee that the overall financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or errors, and to issue an auditor Report including my opinion. Reasonable guarantee is a high level of guarantee, but it cannot ensure that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will detect all material misstatements that exist. Misstatements can arise from fraud or errors, and are considered material misstatements if they, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements.\n\nDuring the course of my audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and execute audit procedures to address those risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk resulting from error;\n- Understand the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this does not aim to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Secretary, as well as the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and related information disclosure made by them;\n- Determine whether the Financial Secretary’s practice of adopting a going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, determine whether there is a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I believe that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw users’ attention to the relevant information disclosure in the financial statements in my auditor’s report. If the related information disclosed is insufficient, I must issue a qualified auditor’s report. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained as at the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly represent transactions and matters; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group, in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for guiding, supervising and executing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee under the Exchange Fund consultation Committee regarding the audit scope and time of the programme, as well as significant audit findings and matters, including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identify during the period.\n"}
