Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations.

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在二零一五年經歷增長放緩，反映本地需求疲弱及出口表現欠佳。預期二零一六年的經濟增長將繼續保持低迷，受到嚴峻的外部逆風和脆弱的金融市場狀況影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港經濟於年內增長放緩，實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長由2014年的2.6% 減至2.4%（表1）。這反映了內需增長較為溫和，但淨出口轉為對GDP增長作出正面貢獻，原因是總進口下降速度快於總出口（圖1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞動力市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低位。由於本地成本和進口價格的壓力減退，通脹進一步緩和。本地股市在環球金融市場波動加劇的情況下，出現大幅波動。在二月份公布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅物業市場開始降溫，房屋價格在年底進一步顯示出整合的跡象。\n\n圖表 1 按貢獻度劃分的實際國內生產總值增長\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按支出分項的實際國內生產毛額增長率（期間變動）\n\n請注意：經季節性調整後，按季變動的國內固定資本形成總額變動率暫未提供。\n來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，二零一五年港元匯率保持穩定，兌美元匯率徘徊於7.75附近。由於與股權相關的資金流入，四月觸發了聯繫匯率制度下的強方兌換承諾，九月和十月再次觸發，反映了離岸人民幣兌換成港元以及部分商業對港元的需求。隨着總結餘增加，本地利率繼續保持低位，而香港金融管理局基礎利率在十二月中旬美國加息後，由0.5% 調整至0.75%。由於信貸需求放緩，銀行體系整體貸款增長進一步放慢至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降。銀行業整體貸款質素略有下降，但不良貸款比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年，國內需求增長速度放緩。儘管就業和所得狀況大致穩定，持續提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱以及資產價格的修正，在下半年對私人消費增長造成拖累。然而，由於上半年相對強勁的增長勢頭，全年的私人消費增長率從2014年的3.3%提高至4.8%。政府消費增長略快，為3.4%。事實上，國內需求增長放緩主要由於總體固定資本形成減少了2.2%（圖表2）。在商業信心惡化下，私營部門的機械設備投資連續第二年萎縮，同時公共工程進展放緩也導致建築和施工活動的增長動能減弱。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港於2015年的出口表現轉差（圖表3）。商品出口錄得普遍下跌1.7%，為自2009年以來首次。對日本和歐盟的出口下降，而對美國的出口增長則甚微。這些發達市場疲弱的最終需求也對區域工業活動和區域內貿易造成影響。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、韓國和台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體中間和最終需求疲軟而減少。香港的服務出口持續從往年高速增長的路徑放緩，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊減速所致。商品進口也隨着內需和出口帶動的需求減弱而回落。與此相反，由於本地居民強烈的旅遊興趣，服務進口增長速度加快。綜合來看，2015年整體貿易順差略有改善，為GDP增長帶來了溫和的正面貢獻。\n\n圖表 2 內需\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n潛在通脹於2015年進一步緩和，主要受到本地成本壓力減退及進口物價通脹降低的影響。剔除政府一次性緩解措施的影響後，潛在通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（圖表4）。由於經濟活動平靜，勞工成本壓力保持穩定，而商業及工業物業租金壓力則有所緩解，尤其是在下半年。受惠於全球商品價格下跌及港元保持強勁，進口物價壓力減輕，而食品通脹亦維持低位。由於較早季度新租賃住宅租金的傳導效應溫和，通脹的租金組成部分仍然受到控制。\n\n圖表 3 商品及服務出口\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n圖表 4 潛在消費者物價通脹\n資料來源：香港特區政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年勞動市場狀況保持穩定。 雖然與貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業人數略有下降，但其他商業部門的聘用步伐穩健，有效抵銷了該降幅，整體就業人數較去年增長1.3%。 勞動力供應亦增加1.3%，全年的季節性調整失業率維持在約3.3% (圖5)。 由於勞動市場仍然緊張，年初三季勞工收入名義增長4.7%，較2014年的4.3%為高。 隨著通脹壓力減輕，年初三季實質勞工收入增長1.3%，而2014年則錄得下降0.1%。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市在外部環境急劇變化的一年經歷了波動。在第一季表現平淡後，受內地A股市場樂觀情緒和資金流入的帶動，本地股市在第二季表現強勁。恆生指數在四月一度攀升至七年高位，滬港通南向每日額度自2014年11月開通以來首次被用罄（圖6）。然而，自六月底起，本地市場逆轉下跌，恆生指數在內地A股市場和全球股市的拋售、全球外匯市場波動加劇以及國際商品價格疲軟的影響下，在九月跌至年低，跌幅達28%。在第四季，隨著全球和內地金融市場的穩定，香港股市有所回升。總體而言，2015年恆生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而平均每日成交額從2014年的695億港元升至1056億港元。儘管下半年集資活動有所放緩，但本地股市籌集的整體股本資金仍從前一年的9427億港元增加至11156億港元。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整合跡象。在經歷了2015年初的繁榮期後，隨着二月份公布第七輪審慎措施，住宅物業市場開始回軟。雖然房屋價格上漲速度放緩，並在第四季出現下跌，但2015年房屋價格的累計增長為2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖表6）。與此同時，交易量較去年下降12.3%，降至55,982個單位，原因是第二半期二手市場的交易活動明顯減少。投機性交易，包括確認書交易和短期炒賣，持續保持低位。儘管如此，家庭負擔能力仍然吃緊，價格收入比達到15.7，而收入負擔比仍然遠高於長期平均水平。商業及工業物業市場上半年表現強勁，但其後交易活動趨於回軟，價格和租金在第四季均錄得下跌。租金回報率與去年大致相同，並保持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖表六 資產價格\n資料來源：評級及估值部與香港交易所。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港於2016年的經濟增長預期將保持疲軟。私人機構分析員預測經濟將以較慢的平均速度增長1.7%，而政府則預測增長率介乎1%至2%之間。具體而言，全球經濟前景不明朗、來港旅遊持續低迷，以及全球金融市場動盪所帶來的負面影響，將繼續制約香港出口的表現。本地方面，預期私人消費將溫和增長，但勞工市場狀況可能因經濟動能減弱而面臨壓力，本地資產價格調整亦可能削弱消費者信心，並引發負面財富效應。建造業及建築活動或能維持，但疲弱的商業情緒和利率上升將打擊私人資本投資。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n預期二零一六年的通脹壓力將會受到控制。進口價格壓力預料將保持溫和，而本地成本壓力則預期在溫和的經濟增長勢頭下保持適度。由於二零一五年底新租賃房屋租金的壓力減輕，通脹中的租金成分也可能有所緩解。市場普遍預測二零一六年的整體通脹率為百分之二點五，而政府則預測核心通脹率為百分之二點零。由於入境遊減緩以及出口行業持續低迷，勞動力市場也可能略為放緩。私人分析師目前預計二零一六年的失業率將上升至百分之三點五。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n二零一六年的經濟展望存在不少不確定性和風險。特別是美國進一步加息的速度、全球經濟增長前景以及商品價格走勢，將繼續是主要的風險來源。任何重大的不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場和國際資本流動的波動，進而收緊本地貨幣和金融狀況，並為香港的經濟增長前景蒙上陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟造成的影響，將取決於它們透過財富效應和資產負債表效應對房地產市場的影響程度。雖然房地產市場正面臨全球和本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及供需差距縮小等多重下行風險，但仍需時間觀察房地產市場是否已進入下行週期。儘管房地產市場的急劇調整可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但過去幾年推出的逆週期宏觀審慎措施和其他監管措施已顯著提升香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n香港銀行業在年內保持了韌性，儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分歧，且新興市場經濟體的脆弱性不斷累積。認可機構的流動資金狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的認可機構資本充裕。零售銀行的資產質素略有下降，但仍維持在健康的水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n與美元利率同步，港元銀行同業拆息全年在低位徘徊。零售銀行港元資金成本上半年隨著綜合利率下降而減少，下半年則保持穩定（圖表7）。\n\n圖表 7 香港銀行同業拆息 (HIBOR) 定盤價、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率 (BLR)\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息定盤價指香港銀行協會公布的港元利率結算，並為每月平均值。\n\n最佳貸款利率乃香港上海匯豐銀行有限公司所報之利率（每月平均值）。\n\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n2015年銀行業的盈利能力有所放緩。零售銀行香港分行的總體稅前經營利潤下降了2.8%，雖然費用及佣金收入（增長9.7%）、外匯及衍生工具業務收入（增長22.4%）以及淨利息收入（增長1.3%）有所增長，但卻被經營支出增加8.8%以及貸款減值損失增加76%所抵消。然而，零售銀行的稅後利潤增長了14.7%，主要得益於出售策略性投資所得的收益。零售銀行的平均資產稅後回報率從2014年的0.99% 提升至1.05%（圖表8）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n港元匯率在二零一五年全年大致保持穩定，儘管金融市場動盪，且美國於十二月啟動加息。資金市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行體系間流動性充裕。作為過去數十年香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度抵禦外來衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元在外的匯價穩定，即在港元與美元的匯率於外匯市場內，維持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元之間。 貨幣制度的結構以聯繫匯率制度為特色，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有100%的美元儲備於外匯基金作支持，而貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括\n\n債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的銀行券提供十足擔保\n政府發行的在流通中的紙幣及硬幣\n結算餘額，即銀行於香港金融管理局持有的結算戶餘額總和\n香港金融管理局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及紙幣\n\n港元匯率的穩定，透過自動調整利率機制以及香港金融管理局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）來維持。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方兌換承諾水平7.75港元兌1美元時，金管局隨時準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。此舉將增加結餘，以降低港元利率，從而營造有利於港元遠離強方限位，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區間內的貨幣狀況。相反，如果港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方兌換承諾水平7.85港元兌1美元時，金管局將向銀行買入港元。此舉將減少結餘，以提高港元利率，從而推動港元遠離弱方限位，並維持在兌換區間內。\n\n本處所示之債務憑證以及政府發行流通之紙幣和硬幣，均以港幣面值列示。本年報中交換基金資產負債表所列之相關項目，則以相當於其於資產負債表日現行匯率贖回所需之美元金額的港幣價值表示。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\n於本報告中列示的交換基金票據（EFBN）金額與本年度報告中交換基金的資產負債表所列金額有所不同。 根據香港公認會計原則，香港金融管理局代表交換基金於二級市場買賣的EFBN，會與已發行的EFBN互相抵銷，而淨額則於資產負債表中記錄。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n# 二零一五年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n2015年港元匯率大致保持穩定，對美元的交易區間在7.7500至7.7657之間窄幅波動（圖表1）。2015年初，由於市場對美國加息的擔憂，港元一度承受輕微貶值壓力。然而，在第二季度，受股市活躍帶動，對港元的需求激增，尤其是在四月份多次觸及強方兌換保証（7.75），港元匯率隨之走強至接近7.75水平。進入下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著拋售，全球外匯市場（包括人民幣）波動加劇，港元匯率在八月份仍持續徘徊在7.75美元附近。受到離岸人民幣兌換成港元的影響，強方兌換保証在九月和十月再次觸發。美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）在十二月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調25個基點，但港元匯率仍維持在窄幅區間內波動，並未出現明顯資金外流壓力。總體而言，儘管全球金融市場動盪，2015年香港外匯市場運作保持有序。\n\n圖表一：二零一五年市場匯率\n\n由於在四月、九月及十月強方兌換觸發多次，金管局根據聯繫匯率制度，被動地從銀行手中購入總計293億美元，並兌換了2272億港元。這導致總結餘金額相應增加，部分增加被因應銀行強勁的流動性管理需求而發行額外之交換基金票據所抵銷（圖表2）。額外發行交換基金票據符合聯繫匯率制度原則，因為這代表貨幣基礎的結構性變動，而貨幣基礎完全以外匯儲備作支持。於2015年底，總結餘金額與未償交換基金票據及紙幣總額增至12210億港元，較一年前的9925億港元為高。\n\n圖表 2：二零一五年結餘及未償還之交換基金票據總額\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n銀行體系充裕的流動資金使香港銀行同業拆息於整個2015年保持低位。由於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間於12月16日（美國時間）由0–0.25%調整至0.25–0.5%，根據預設公式，基準利率亦於12月17日上調至0.75%。整體而言，2015年各期限（由隔夜至三個月）的銀行同業拆息均低於基準利率（圖表3），並受銀行季節性資金需求以及8月份金融市場波動導致的資金緊張影響而出現適度波動。香港銀行同業拆息與倫敦銀行同業拆息的利差大致同步，香港元遠期點數在8月份因市場資金緊張而轉為顯著溢價，隨後在年底因美元利率普遍上升而回落至貼水（圖表4）。總體而言，貨幣市場運作暢通。再貼現窗口借款活動甚少，2015年全年金額僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n圖表三：二零一五年香港銀行同業拆息利率\n\n圖表四：二零一五年港幣遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直運作暢順，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻。 鑒於香港經濟規模細小且具開放性，以及其作為國際金融中心的地位，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定致力維持聯繫匯率制度。 實際上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了政府的承諾信譽，公眾對港元作為支付手段和價值儲存工具的信心依然強烈。 國際貨幣基金會（IMF）在二零一五年對香港進行第四條諮詢時，繼續支持聯繫匯率制度是香港的最佳貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架、充裕的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系是支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑒於穩健的銀行體系對聯系匯率制度的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察銀行信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理情況和壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管，以提升銀行業的抗風險能力。 鑑於美國利率上升，香港金融管理局提醒公眾做好風險管理所需準備，並指出觸發弱方兌換保證及港元資金外流是港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高外匯基金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分指定用於支持貨幣基礎。於2015年，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3%至107.5%的窄幅區間內，未觸及上下限觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率收報106.3%（圖表5）。根據「聯系匯率制度」，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可動用以支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財務資源為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強有力的後盾，以應對突發衝擊。\n\n圖表五：2015年擔保比率每日變動情況\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣事務委員會轄下結匯基金諮詢委員會監察及審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2015年，該委員會審議的議題包括全球銀行提供的美元貸款供應、國際宏觀審慎措施的運用、美國加息對香港房地產市場的影響、基礎利率的慗定公式、港元實質有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興經濟體的國家風險。委員會的討論記錄以及提交予委員會的貨幣事務委員會運作報告均已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n香港金融研究所（香港金研院）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。二零一五年，該研究所接待了十六位研究員，並發表了二十七篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五項國際會議及研討會，其中主要包括：\n\n一年一度的第六屆國際中華經濟研討會於一月舉行，主題為「槓桿作用與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。研討會共發表了十一篇高品質研究論文，涵蓋了諸多議題，例如中國企業的槓桿問題、中國信貸擴張與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給。\n五月，香港金融管理局研究院與香港大學合辦了題為「香港金管局-香港大學金融、制度與經濟增長國際研討會」的會議。會議探討了多種經濟議題，包括銀行業與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n十月，香港金融管理局研究院、美國聯邦儲備理事會、歐洲中央銀行及達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦了以「分歧的貨幣政策、全球資本流動與金融穩定」為主題的會議。會議深入探討了貨幣政策、國際資本流動與匯率之間的關係，分歧的貨幣政策對全球金融穩定的影響，主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等廣泛議題。\n\n本院亦於八月舉辦第十三屆香港金融管理局研究局夏季研討營，並於九月舉辦第十三屆香港金融管理局研究局內地經濟研討會，探討中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。是次研討會及研討營吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的代表參與。此外，本院在年內舉辦了二十四場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n於2015年底，流通銀行券總值為3602億港元，較一年前增加5.3%（圖表6、7及8）。政府發行紙幣及硬幣的總值為112億港元，上升2.9%（圖表9及10）。其中，政府發行的10港元紙幣流通價值為40億港元，當中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在認可機構的風險管治上，包括信貸風險和流動性風險管理體系、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制，以及投資及保險產品的銷售行為。隨著系統性風險的積累，金管局宣布自2016年1月1日起，香港的地域性逆周期資本緩衝為0.625%（及自2017年1月1日起為1.25%）。五家認可機構被指定為本地系統性重要銀行，並將受較高的損失吸收力資本緩衝約束。在恢復及決議機制改革方面取得了顯著進展，並已向立法會提交《金融機構（決議）條例》。金管局亦加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融從業員的技能和知識發展。\n\n# 二零一五年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n鑑於主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的跡象，新興市場在2015年面臨資本外流風險增加及經濟增長放緩的挑戰。為維持銀行業在宏觀經濟環境可能突然惡化情況下的韌性，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察認可機構的風險管理及信貸風險和流動性風險管理系統的有效性。\n\n# 作業監督\n\n二零一五年，金管局繼續採納監理方式，即定期實地檢查與增加主題審查相輔相成。主題審查是對選定的認可金融機構特定風險領域或具體活動進行深入的非實地審查。這種方式使金管局能夠優先分配監理資源，專注於認可金融機構新興及更重要的風險。\n\n年內，金管局共進行了193次實地檢查。鑑於金融機構貸款組合資產質素出現惡化的跡象，金管局加強了對信貸風險管理和資產質素的深入主題式實地檢查。 考慮到主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分歧導致市場不確定性增加，金管局亦增加了對庫務相關活動的檢查次數。 實地檢查範圍還包括與內地業務相關的業務、壓力測試、流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（反洗錢\/反恐融資）控制，以及金融機構的內部評級法（IRB）模型。 年內，專門團隊亦對金融機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務進行了實地檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題式會外審查，覆蓋範圍與主題式會內檢查相似。表1詳列了運作監察工作的細節。\n\n二零一五年，共進行了196項場外審查，以評估金融機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務營運。監管重點集中於風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸以及巴塞爾協議III標準的落實監察。監管團隊與精選金融機構的董事會及外部審計師保持頻繁聯繫。與金融機構高層管理人員及外部審計師召開了20次三方會議，另與精選金融機構的董事會或董事會層級委員會召開了23次會議。\n\n銀行監理審查委員會審議了四宗案件，全部涉及人工智能的授權事宜。\n\n為更有效運用其監管資源以應對多項競爭優先事項，香港金融管理局繼續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條賦予的權力，要求認可金融機構委任外部審計師跟進潛在重大監管問題。香港金融管理局於2015年根據此條款委託了六份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制，另外兩份報告則涵蓋私人銀行業務，其餘報告則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n於二零一五年，並無任何認可金融機構違反與資本充足率或流動比率相關的銀行條例規定。雖然共有八十四宗違反條例各項條文的事件，但均未損害存款人的利益，且均已獲認可金融機構迅速糾正。\n\n表 1 作業監督\n\n# 銀行條例第五十二條賦予的權力\n\n美利銀行有限公司繼續受到《銀行條例》第52條賦予權力的執行。 金融管理局於2008年6月25日根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對美利銀行有限公司香港分行事務、業務及財產所施加的指令，在年內仍然有效。 金管局將繼續與相關當局定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總行相關的發展情況，並將密切關注為保障存款人的利益而採取的監管措施。\n\n# CAMEL 評級審查\n\n評估委員會審閱並確定了各機構的綜合 CAMEL 評級。各機構已獲告知評級結果，並被給予要求覆審的機會。本年度並無任何機構提出覆審申請。\n\n# 專業監督工作\n\n# 營運及科技風險監控\n\n香港金融管理局持續發出新的或更新的營運及科技風險管理指引，以應對新興風險和行業發展。具體而言，金管局已完成修訂有關電子銀行業務的《監理政策手冊》（SPM）章節，從而讓認可機構在提供新的電子銀行服務方面擁有更大的靈活性。此外，金管局發出了一份關於網絡安全的通函，重申董事會和認可機構高層管理人員對有效網絡安全風險管理進行監督的重要性。金管局亦定期發布其《營運事故觀察》專刊，重點介紹精選詐騙案件或營運事故的作案手法，以及所發現的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局進行了以風險為基礎的主題式實地及非實地監理審查，以評估選定的認可金融機構在企業層面或特定業務線的營運及科技風險管理情況。 這些審查涵蓋了認可金融機構在營運風險管理框架、網絡安全風險管理、防範內幕交易的控制措施、重要外判服務供應商的監管、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢的科技控制等選定範疇。 這些監理審查亦輔以年度獨立合規檢查，覆蓋營運風險管理框架、科技風險管理（包括客戶數據保護）及業務持續規劃，選定的認可金融機構需要委任獨立且具資格的評估員，以審查其相關控制措施的充分性，並修補已識別的弱點。 金融管理局亦識別及分析認可金融機構營運及科技風險的趨勢和主要監理重點，特別關注在香港貨幣及銀行系統穩定和有效運作中扮演重要角色的認可金融機構。\n\n香港金融管理局監察銀行業界實施晶片自動櫃員機（ATM）技術的最後階段，透過該技術，持牌金融機構已於二零一五年底完成純信用卡的換卡程序。金管局亦要求持牌金融機構實施認證控制，以進一步提升非親身信用卡交易的安全性。此外，在收到報告指部分非接觸式信用卡內儲存的持卡人姓名可能被暗中存取後，金管局要求相關持牌金融機構迅速採取行動，通知及保障受影響的持卡人。金管局投入資源向公眾宣傳及解釋事件的規模和影響，以處理公眾疑慮，並監察持牌金融機構的補救措施，包括迅速更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項舉措，包括就網上銀行安全防範的公眾意識教育計劃、建立一個分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及向香港金融服務業務持續運營管理論壇組織的危機管理演習提供支援和建議，該演習涵蓋人工智能及其他金融機構。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與其他香港金融監管機構緊密合作，就人工智能銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引和監管。透過雙邊和多邊會議，以及在金融管理局聯席委員會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議涵蓋涉及金融集團或於金融服務業不同範疇內擁有緊密業務關係的受監管實體等各項議題，以確保更協調和有效的監管行動。\n\n年內，香港金融管理局進行了25項內部及外部主題式檢查，以及15項人工智能（AI）的外部監察。 這些檢查和監察涵蓋了投資產品銷售、處理證券交易結算及妥善保管客戶證券，以及銷售非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品和與強積金（MPF）相關產品，涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶。\n\n八月份，香港金融管理局向持牌人士發出通函，就向客戶銷售非保證投資連結保險（NLTI）產品的適當性評估和產品資料披露提供指引。 該指引旨在協助持牌人士遵守監管標準，包括保險事務專員公署和香港保險業聯會於七月份發出的相關規定。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與財經事務及庫務局緊密合作，參與《保險公司（修訂）法案》2014年的立法程序，以設立獨立的保險業監管局，並為保險中介人建立法定牌照制度。於七月，立法會通過了《保險公司（修訂）條例》2015年，其中規定了香港金融管理局可透過授權，就保險中介人的保險中介活動行使視察及調查權力。\n\n香港金融管理局處理了六份成為註冊機構（RI）的申請，以及一宗來自註冊機構申請從事額外受規管活動的申請。香港金融管理局已同意委任204名負責監管註冊機構證券活動的行政人員，並對9,697名由註冊機構提交以供納入香港金融管理局備存登記冊的個人進行背景審查。\n\n# 庫務活動監督\n\n人工智能機構的流動性風險管理仍然是金管局的首要監管重點之一，尤其是在考慮到美國預期會恢復正常利率，以及隨之可能出現的資金流向逆轉，這可能會影響人工智能機構的流動性狀況。 全年2015年，金管局繼續實施針對人工智能機構的強化穩定資金要求，以維持足夠的穩定資金來支持其貸款業務。 自2015年1月1日起實施巴塞爾協議III的流動性覆蓋率（LCR）以來，金管局一直監控一類機構的流動性覆蓋率水平和趨勢，整體而言，這些機構的流動性覆蓋率均維持在100%或以上，遠高於2015年過渡期安排下的法定最低要求60%。\n\n另外，金管局已對選定的資產管理公司（「資管公司」）就預期利率正常化相關風險的管理控制框架進行主題式實地檢查。在市場波動的情況下，金管局亦密切關注突發性市場變化及其對銀行業和個別資管公司的影響，並採取適當的後續行動。\n\n# 督導主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n香港金融管理局繼續推行自下而上、由監管機構主導的壓力測試計畫，以更深入了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端和不利經濟狀況下的韌性，並鼓勵它們制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的計畫。年內，針對精選領域的風險動態，引入了若干改進措施以收集更詳盡的資訊。金管局分析了參與的認可機構提交的結果，並與它們探討如何進一步完善其壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n過去幾年觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢自2015年下半年起已有所減緩。全年度來看，銀行體系總貸款增長3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降（表2）。由於客戶存款增長速度快於銀行貸款，整體貸款存款比率由去年的72.2%下降至2015年底的70.1%。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，需要更緊密的國際合作與溝通以維持穩定。年內，香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並致力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括改善金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及把握人民幣國際化機遇，進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港穩健的經濟基礎和良好的財政表現持續受到信用評級機構的認可，標準普爾維持香港的AAA最高信用評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，議題涉及對全球及區域金融穩定至關重要的事項。七月份，香港金融管理局接任亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）的共同主席職位，任期兩年。該小組旨在促進金融穩定理事會會員與非會員之間在政策倡議上的互動，鼓勵落實金融改革，並促進就金融穩定議題交流意見。香港金融管理局繼續與東盟加三機構緊密合作，以加強東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦事處（AMRO）的運作——該辦事處已升格為國際組織——以監測和分析區域經濟，並支援清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n年內，由於多項市場因素影響，香港離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行規模出現一定程度的收縮。然而，市場運作仍然有序，人民幣貿易結算、銀行信貸及外匯交易量保持穩定增長。此外，透過香港進行及在香港展開的人民幣業務不斷增長，有助於國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）確認人民幣為一種可自由使用的貨幣。IMF將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將進一步推動人民幣國際化以及香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作及其持續發展，對於鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的競爭優勢，以及全球人民幣離岸業務樞紐的地位，扮演著重要的角色。2015年，香港人民幣支付系統的結算額創下新高，而場外衍生工具（OTC）交易報告庫則繼續協助各實體按照七月起推行的新的場外衍生工具市場監管制度，申報其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金融基礎設施於2015年透過金管局的進一步提升，增加了新的組件和服務，其中包括於十二月成功推出「易支票」服務，意味著現有超過150家銀行均可透過互聯網和流動渠道為客戶收妥及處理易支票。於2013年推出的電子結單及繳費服務（EBPP）在2015年繼續錄得商戶參與度增長。七月，中央資金市場單位（CMu）在其基金指令路由服務下推出一項服務，以支援「內地與香港互認基金」計劃的實施。此外，為提升零售支付產品及服務的監管框架，於十一月開始生效的《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）正式生效。根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》，金管局獲賦權對多用途儲值設施實施強制性牌照制度，並執行相關的監察和執法職能，以及指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全及高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 二零一五年回顧\n\n# 國際及區域合作\n\n隨着全球金融市場聯繫日益緊密，金管局積極與其他司法管轄區合作，透過包括金融穩定委員會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）和亞太經濟合作組織（APEC）等國際及區域論壇，促進可持續經濟增長和金融體系穩定。金管局亦會繼續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以協助增強全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局於七月擔任金融穩定委員會（FSB）區域委員會（亞洲）（RCG(A)）聯席主席，並於十月在香港主持其第九次會議。區域委員會（亞洲）為金融穩定委員會成員及非成員提供一個重要的溝通與合作平台，共同探討金融穩定議題。來自亞洲十六個地區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高級代表出席會議，討論區內所面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、不當行為風險以及存款保險計劃的經驗。香港金融管理局亦於八月與全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）共同主持一場關於香港宏觀審慎政策的研討會。研討會吸引了來自世界各地十八個中央銀行的代表參與，與會者分享了宏觀審慎政策的經驗，重點關注工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。此外，香港金融管理局亦與英國銀行及國際貨幣基金組織共同主辦一場會議，探討中央銀行及其他政策制定者在選擇最佳貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策組合時所面臨的挑戰。會議吸引了超過一百名參與者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 維護亞洲貨幣及金融穩定\n\n香港金融管理局維持對區域合作倡議的承諾，以促進亞洲金融穩定，並匯集區域共同聲音參與國際金融事務。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行主管會議（EMEAP）轄下宏觀監控委員會的工作協調員，金管局繼續編製委員會每半年一次的宏觀監測報告，評估區域風險和脆弱性以及政策影響。作為EMEAP支付和結算系統工作小組的主席，金管局與副主席緊密合作，協調小組分享經驗、交流風險管理、監管、標準和最佳實踐，以及國內和跨境支付及結算系統發展情況的努力。金管局亦領導該工作小組的跨境合作與發展子組。六月，金管局在香港主辦了EMEAP\/BIS外匯市場論壇和EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）會議。會議吸引了來自區域及主要經濟體的17個主管機構代表參加，審視金融市場最新發展和金融監管改革。\n\n繼去年香港與東盟加三權威簽署《亞盟宏觀經濟研究辦公室協議》後，亞盟宏觀經濟研究辦公室於二零一六年二月升格為國際組織，以支持其在強化區域儲備庫（CMIM）下的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信用評級\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與國際信用評級機構保持緊密溝通，以提供對香港經濟表現和財政實力的平衡評估。這些努力促成所有主要信用評級機構在2015年重申香港的信用評級。標準普爾再次確認香港的最高AAA級評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體，其增長前景優於平均水平，擁有龐大的財政儲備，財政表現 consistently 穩健，以及強勁的淨外部資產狀況。穆迪投資服務和惠譽評級也分別維持香港的評級在Aa1和AA+，僅次於AAA級。\n\n# 香港發展成為離岸人民幣業務中心\n\n於2015年，市場因素對香港的人民幣資金池產生影響。 年底，未償人民幣客戶存款及證書的餘額為人民幣1,0100億元，較一年前的1,1580億元減少（圖1）。 隨着內地市場利率下降，離岸人民幣債券發行有所放緩。 因此，在香港發行的人民幣債券下降至人民幣750億元。 另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易增加9%，達到人民幣6,8330億元。 未償人民幣銀行貸款亦按年增長58%，至人民幣2970億元（圖2）。 人民幣即時總結算（RTGS）系統的平均每日成交額增加至人民幣9470億元，較2014年增加29%。 與此同時，香港的離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步增長，調查結果顯示，截至2015年4月底的每日成交額相當於930億美元，較2013年BIS三年期調查時的4月份增長88%。 香港仍然是最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，市場具有相當的深度和廣度。 另一個鞏固香港此地位的重要發展是7月實施的「人民幣合格機構投資者」計劃，擴大了香港的人民幣產品供應。\n\n香港金融管理局擴展跨境人民幣資金流動渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界攜手提升香港人民幣金融平台的共同努力，持續取得成效。六月份，中國人民銀行宣布，離岸人民幣結算銀行和參與銀行可於內地銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得款項轉回離岸，以便利在離岸市場的銀行進行人民幣流動性管理。九月份，中國人民銀行放寬了關於跨境人民幣現金集中池的規定，使更多跨國公司能夠在簡化的安排下進行集團內部資金轉移。此外，中國內地當局於七月份向外國央行、國際金融機構和主權財富基金擴大內地銀行間債券市場的准入。他們並在九月份進一步向這些機構開放內地外匯市場。\n\n於2015年11月30日，國際貨幣基金組織宣布將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，生效日期為2016年10月1日。此決定肯定了人民幣作為一種可自由使用的貨幣的地位，並進一步提升了國際社會對人民幣在全球交易中使用信心。作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將受益於人民幣進一步國際化以及中國大陸與全球經濟和金融體系聯繫更加緊密所帶來的全新商機。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務上的合作。金管局與澳洲共同主辦第三屆人民幣貿易及投資對話，與倫敦共同主辦第五屆人民幣商業論壇，並與馬來西亞和泰國第二次合作，促進私營機構就人民幣業務展開討論。透過這些舉措，香港銀行加強了人民幣業務流程及與其他市場的聯繫，從而為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。金管局亦積極加強推廣工作，鼓勵企業和機構在貿易、投資和融資方面更廣泛地使用人民幣，包括參與在香港及海外市場（包括加拿大、日本和非洲）的業界活動。\n\n香港金融管理局副行政總裁余偉文先生於二零一五年十二月十一日在第五屆香港倫敦人民幣論壇的一個研討會上發言。\n\n# CEPA\n\n一項旨在達成兩岸服務貿易基本自由化的新協議於十一月在《更緊密經貿關係安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署。 該協議將2014年在廣東省試行的自由化措施擴大至全國範圍。 透過原則上賦予香港銀行國民待遇，預計此協議將為這些銀行在中國大陸經營業務提供更明確的政策保障和更大的靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局和中國銀行業監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。除了處理中央銀行業務和一般風險管理的課程外，課程內容還包括消費者保護、信用資料、貨幣及抵押品管理、金融穩健性指標分析以及系統性風險監測。此外，亦為來自海外銀行和執法機構的代表團舉辦特別培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n年內，香港金融管理局安排了八次機構政府債券招標，總額為204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n二零一五年全球金融市場動盪不安，對投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此艱難的投資環境下，香港金融管理局於二零一五年錄得整體投資回報率為負零點六巴仙，但由於金管局過去數年採取了一系列防禦性措施，提升了外匯基金的抗逆力，使其虧損相對主要市場指數及同類投資基金而言，相對輕微。\n\n# 結匯基金\n\n交換基金的主要目標，正如《交換基金條例》所訂明，是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯價。該基金亦可被用來維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全，以協助香港保持國際金融中心的地位。交換基金由財政司司長控制，並可在諮詢交換基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 結匯基金管理制度\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n香港金融管理局已為外匯基金設定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 以保本為首要目標；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均以高度流動的美元計價資產充分支持；\n(c) 確保為維持貨幣及金融穩定目的提供足夠的流動性；以及\n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以協助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了外匯基金的法定宗旨，並已融入基金的投資組合結構和目標資產配置。\n\n總體而言，外匯基金主要由兩個投資組合構成： backing 組合和投資組合。backing 組合持有高度流通的美元計價資產，以符合聯繫匯率制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作暨發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場，以保值並維持資產的長期購買力。這兩個投資組合的整體長期債券與股票配置目標比例為 72:28。在目標貨幣組合方面，81% 的資產配置於美元和港元，其餘 19% 配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更有效地管理風險及提升中長期的回報，金管局一直以審慎及漸進的方式，將部分外匯基金的投資組合多元化，投資範圍包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股票投資於投資組合內持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則於長期增長投資組合（LTGP）內持有。金管局於長期增長投資組合內的資產淨值上限維持在外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，長期增長投資組合內的投資市值總額為1421億港元，其中私募股權投資為913億港元，房地產投資為508億港元，未償投資承諾金額為1224億港元。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年成立，用以持有香港交易所收購的股份，該等股份由政府代表外匯基金以策略性目的購入。由於此組合的特殊性質，並未將其納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映於投資基準，代表外匯基金在投資目標下，長遠而言的最佳資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術性配置，以嘗試超越基準的回報。這通常意味著實際配置與基準或策略性配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術偏離」。基準以及戰術偏離的限額由財政司司長在諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後決定，而戰術決策則由金管局在授權下作出。在允許的戰術偏離限額內，投資組合經理可採取措施，以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部人員直接管理約76%的交換基金投資，其中包括整個後盾投資組合和部分投資組合。這部分投資組合包含投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及實施基金宏觀風險管理策略的各類衍生工具覆疊投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局亦會委聘於多個國際金融中心駐紮的外部基金經理，管理約佔外匯基金資產的24%，其中包括其所有上市股權投資組合和其他專業化資產。委聘外部經理的目的，是善用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以獲取多元化的投資風格，並將市場知識和資訊轉移至內部專業人員。\n\n與外部經理人使用相關的支出包括基金管理費、保管費、交易成本以及預扣及其他稅款。這些支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。對於內部及外部管理的投資組合，均已建立嚴格的控制和投資指引，並對指引及法規的遵守情況進行密切監察。風險控制工具被應用於評估正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。香港金融管理局亦會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內部及外部經理的投資技能。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 二零一五年金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動劇烈。尤其股市經歷了異常的動盪。年初，主要股市均創下新高。然而，受中國大陸經濟增長疑慮影響，市場情緒在第三季度急劇惡化，主要股市回吐年初以來所得，並錄得顯著的季度虧損。隨後，隨著市場情緒的改善，全球股市有所回升，但年底再次惡化。由於與中國大陸經濟緊密相連，香港股市在2015年的表現遜於其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國利率將正常化並開始升息循環，但2015年美國長期國債收益率僅溫和上漲，原因是樂觀情緒受到全球經濟增長擔憂、全球通縮壓力揮之不去以及地緣政治緊張局勢加劇的制約。另一方面，在歐洲央行採取激進貨幣寬鬆政策的影響下，短期歐洲政府債券收益率下降，甚至有部分跌入負值區域。\n\n在外匯市場方面，美元在2015年持續走強，美元指數上漲近10%，主要受到市場預期美國將開始調整其貨幣政策的影響。歐元在第一季大幅走弱，錄得自1999年以來單季最大跌幅，原因在於歐洲中央銀行於一月份宣布實施量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在2015年對美元匯率基本保持平穩。\n\n表一顯示了2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 匯風基金表現\n\n在極度動盪的金融市場和艱難的投資環境下，外匯基金於二零一五年錄得投資虧損港幣158億元，其中包括海外股權投資收益港幣71億元、香港股權投資虧損港幣50億元、債券投資收益港幣159億元、非港元資產因匯率換算產生負面影響港幣449億元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益港幣111億元。去年美元大幅升值，將外匯基金的非美元資產換算為港幣，導致匯率換算產生負面影響在所難免。另一方面，策略性投資組合錄得估值收益港幣22億元。\n\n於二零一五年年底，外匯基金總資產達三萬四千二百二十九億港元。外匯基金於二零一五年的投資回報率（不包括策略投資組合）為負零點六巴仙。儘管如此，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及整體投資基金業界相比，外匯基金的虧損可算輕微。為預期投資環境惡化，金管局過去數年已採取一系列防守性措施，包括縮短債券投資組合的存續期、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快投資多元化的步伐，尤其透過長期投資計劃的投資。這些措施提升了外匯基金的抗逆力，並有助減輕潛在損失。\n\n基金由1994年至2015年的年度回報載於圖表1。表2顯示了2015年的投資回報以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報。過去三年平均回報為1.2%，過去五年為1.8%，過去十年為3.3%，自1994年以來為5.0%。表3顯示了基金於2015年12月31日的資產貨幣組合。\n\n圖表 1 匯風投資回報率 (1994 – 2015)\n1 投資回報率計算不包括策略投資組合的持有量。\n2 綜合消費者物價指數乃根據2009\/2010年基準系列計算。\n"}

Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 公司職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他多種渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以增進對其政策和運作的理解。二零一五年，香港金融管理局致力提升企業管治，包括支持員工專業發展、嚴格執行財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安，以及重新調整高級管理層的職責，藉此應對實施新計劃和系統以及工作日趨複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 參與社群企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度及增進公眾對其政策和工作的理解。二零一五年，共舉辦五十九項開放式傳媒活動，包括十四場新聞發布會、十四次即時採訪及三十一次其他公開活動。此外，另安排了四十三次傳媒採訪，發布了三百二十五份中英文新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n此外，為加強公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的了解，香港金融管理局分別舉辦兩次傳媒參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司，展示香港世界一流的鈔票印製技術和金融基礎設施。同時，亦舉辦了關於聯繫匯率制度、人民幣業務和外匯基金的教育研討會，為傳媒提供這些重要議題更深入的簡報。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德南（中）與執行董事（貨幣管理）李福農（右）在香港印鈔有限公司的傳媒參觀活動上，視察紙幣的安全特性。\n\n香港金融管理局訪港交所（HKICL）時的自動支票分類示範。照片中央（由左至右）為香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德南先生、執行董事（金融基礎設施）李頌義先生，以及香港交所行政總裁唐嘉敏女士。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公眾諮詢\n\n香港金融管理局公共查詢服務為市民提供一個有效的途徑，以獲取有關金管局的資訊，從而更深入了解本組織的主要職能。該服務於二零一五年處理了九千零七十八宗查詢。其中約一半與銀行政策及規例、紙幣及硬幣，以及消費者銀行事務有關。顯著的例子包括按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、洗錢及恐怖主義融資的防範，以及紀念銀幣發行計劃。\n\n圖表一顯示自2012年以來收到的公共查詢數量，而圖表二則提供2015年查詢性質的分類明細。\n\n圖表 1 公眾諮詢總數\n\n# 出版品\n\n除了《香港金融管理局年報》外，香港金融管理局過去一年還發佈了兩期《中期貨幣及金融穩定報告》，四期《季刊》，並定期更新《每月統計通訊》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局高級管理人員撰寫了14篇《洞察》文章，涵蓋各項熱門及及時的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局2014年年報在香港管理學會2015年度最佳年報頒獎典禮中，於「非牟利及慈善機構」組別獲得銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）包含超過五萬頁英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取香港金融管理局最新資訊的主要途徑。 網站亦載有根據《銀行業條例》第20條規定維持的認可金融機構證券人員登記冊，以及認可金融機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊。 隨著《支付系統及儲值設施條例》的實施，網站亦將載列根據該條例的儲值設施持牌人登記冊。 網站已特設專頁及醒目的快捷連結，以引起公眾對重要及時資訊的關注，例如提醒市民提高警惕，防範冒充電話，以及提供「收集硬幣計劃」硬幣收集車的位置資訊。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 公眾教育計畫\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於兩國際金融中心55樓，是向公眾介紹金管局工作及提升市民對貨幣及銀行事務的意識的重要資源。該中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每周開放六天。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣和銀行業的發展歷程。中心提供閱讀資料和展覽品，供公眾研究香港的貨幣、銀行和金融事務。\n\n資訊中心為訪客安排導覽服務。在過去一年，中心接待了超過四萬八千三百名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過六百三十場導覽活動（圖表三）。自二零零三年十二月開幕以來，已有超過五十三萬零四百人次參觀資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，藏有超過二萬三千本書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供深入研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行議題。此外，根據《銀行條例》第二十條的規定，圖書館亦保存香港人工智能的電子登記冊。\n\n為延續與社會聯繫的計劃，香港金融管理局繼續舉辦公眾教育研討會。二零一五年，共舉辦了三次研討會，參與人數約二千三百名中學師生。議題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡智能使用以及存款保障計劃。自一九九八年啟動以來，已有超過五萬四千七百人參與此計劃。\n\n圖表三：資訊中心團體參觀類型\n\n年輕訪客在資訊中心的導覽過程中，了解香港貨幣和銀行業的發展歷程。\n\n中學師生參與公眾教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招聘、發展和維持一支高度專業的人才隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並能靈活應對不斷變化的工作重點。雖然香港金融管理局是政府不可分割的一部分，但它能夠以不同於公務員制度的條件聘用員工，以吸引具備合適經驗和專業知識的人才。作為一個公眾組織，香港金融管理局致力維持精簡而靈活的架構，並重新調配人員資源以開展新措施和應付增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n隨着《支付系統及儲值設施條例》的實施，香港金融管理局於二零一五年十二月在貨幣管理部（貨管部）下成立新的零售支付監察組，以履行金管局在持牌及日常監理儲值設施和其他零售支付系統方面的法定職責。為加強部門協同效應，並重新分配人員資源以應對新措施落實所帶來的挑戰以及日益增加的工作量和複雜性，金融管理局於二零一五年計劃對若干部門的工作職責進行調整，並於二零一六年年初實施。詳情如下：\n\n金融基礎設施部門（金基基）接管了存款保障計劃的行政管理職能，以及來自執法部門（執法部）的結算職能，和來自貨幣管理部門（貨管部）的貨幣職能。此外，它還接管了銀行部門的部分銀行相關工作，例如消費者教育、董事發展以及銀行從業員能力提升框架。\n\n外部部門接管了 MMD 的市場開發職能，而 MMD 將繼續處理與財政市場協會及金融基準相關的工作；且\n\n金融穩定局接管了銀行監理部門的反洗錢及金融犯罪風險部，並將其重新命名為執法及反洗錢部。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n# 人力配置\n\n香港郵政事務管理局於二零一五年成立時編制為八百四十一名。於二零一六年增加三十四名至八百七十五名（增幅為百分之四），以確保提供足夠資源應付 (一) 實施新的法例和措施；(二) 持續推行已證明持續必要的試點計劃；以及 (三) 現有工作的日益複雜和增加。新增職位分配如下：\n\n增強銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試流程的現場檢查、國際銀行標準的落實以及同儕審查。\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險和網絡安全風險管理的監管；\n\n實施有關透過銀行及認可貨幣經紀人進行的店頭（OTC）衍生工具的監管框架，以及根據新生效的店頭衍生工具申報及記錄保存規則；\n\n加強反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資的監督和執法力度；\n\n加緊籌備及準備工作，以落實《金融機構（決策）條例》，該條例採用國際標準，旨在解決金融業界的「大到不能倒」問題。\n\n透過發展銀行獨立非執行董事的權能提升計畫，以提升銀行治理水平，並與業界合作，推動銀行業從業人員在核心銀行業務領域的強化能力框架，從而促進銀行業的能力建設。\n\n加強銀行行為準則政策及新興銀行、證券和保險產品的研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；以及\n\n加強監察和分析在岸人民幣市場及離岸人民幣（即 CNH）市場的發展情況，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強投資、風險管理和法律支援，以配合未來基金的建立及交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化所帶來的投資活動擴展，並在日益嚴峻的投資環境下，提升策略性資產配置和投資流程。\n\n實施新的法定制度，賦權香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監管儲值設施和零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 公司職能\n\n調撥暫用資源以應付其他工作需求。香港金融管理局會將員工以調職形式借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）和金融服務發展局，協助其對香港或金管局有利益的活動或政策倡議。部分員工亦會全職或兼職調派，為香港存款保障計劃及聯匯市場公會提供運作支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪資檢討機制\n\n財政司司長根據治理委員會（GSC）的建議，透過外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並會參考現行市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬構成包括現金總包及強積金計劃，實物福利則極少。現金總包包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及變動薪金，變動薪金會根據員工表現，每年以一次過形式發放給個別員工。\n\n香港金融管理局員工的薪酬，由財政司司長根據公務員薪酬委員會（透過職位評估常設委員會）的建議進行年度檢討，並會考慮公務員薪酬委員會對香港金融管理局上一年度表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司對金融界薪酬的調查結果，以及任何其他相關因素。為保持優秀員工的薪酬競爭力，不時或會作出特別調整。\n\n任何經批准的香港金融管理局固定薪酬或變動薪酬調整，均根據員工的表現分配予個別員工。香港金融管理局的投資專業人士適用變動薪酬制度，旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。對於職級為執行董事或以上的個別員工，其薪酬調整或獎勵由財政司長根據薪酬委員會的建議批准。相關員工在討論其薪酬時不會在場。職級為部門主管及以下的個別員工薪酬調整或獎勵，由香港金融管理局行政總裁根據財政司長的授權及在已批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 匯豐儲備基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n交換基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 審計署\n# 中華人民共和國香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司\n\n我謹此證明，我已審核了第134至222頁所列載的交換基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）財務報表，包括截至2015年12月31日的交換基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至同日止年度的收益及支出帳、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包含重大會計政策摘要及其他解釋性資料。\n\n# 金融管理局對財務報表的責任\n\n金融管理局負責根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官的指示，以及香港財務報告準則編製真實公允的財務報表，並為此建立其認為有必要之內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審核結果對這些財務報表發表意見。我依照《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官指示及審計署審計準則進行審核。這些準則要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃及執行審核工作，以獲取合理保證，判斷財務報表是否不存在重大錯誤陳述。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以獲取有關財務報表金額和披露的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括評估財務報表存在重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是由於舞弊或錯誤所致。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與該實體編製真實公允的財務報表相關的內部控制，以便設計適當於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對該實體內部控制的有效性發表意見。審計還包括評估貨幣當局使用的會計政策的適當性以及所作會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體列報。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠及適當，能為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n本人認為，截至二零一五年十二月三十一日，財務報表真實而公允地反映了交換基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及彼等截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港財務報告準則妥善編製，且符合根據《交換基金條例》第七條行政長官指示所作出的規定。\n\n孫大衛\n審計總監\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計署\n香港灣仔\n告士威路7號\n入境事務大樓26樓\n\n# 內容目錄\n\n收益及支出表\n全面收益表\n資產負債表\n權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務\n2. 重大會計政策\n3. 會計政策變動\n4. 收入與支出\n5. 收入稅\n6. 金融資產及金融負債類別\n7. 現金及隨時可動用的資金\n8. 存放於銀行及其他金融機構的資金\n9. 指定以公平價值衡量之金融資產\n10. 可供出售證券\n11. 衍生金融工具\n12. 持至到期證券\n13. 貸款組合\n14. 黃金\n15. 其他資產\n16. 於子公司之權益\n17. 於聯營公司及合資企業之權益\n18. 投資物業\n19. 物業、廠房及設備\n20. 債務憑證、政府發行貨幣紙幣及流通硬幣\n21. 銀行體系餘額\n22. 銀行及其他金融機構存放款\n23. 財政儲備存放款\n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存放款\n25. 結匯基金票據及紙幣發行\n26. 銀行貸款\n27. 其他已發行債務證券\n28. 其他負債\n29. 股本\n30. 現金流量表內現金及現金等價物分析\n31. 經營分部資料\n32. 質押資產\n33. 或有承諾\n34. 或有負債\n35. 重大關聯方交易\n36. 金融風險管理\n37. 金融工具之公平價值衡量\n38. 調整後之期後事件\n39. 於截至2015年12月31日止年度已發布但尚未生效之修正案、新準則及詮釋可能產生之影響\n40. 財務報表批准\n\n# 結匯基金 – 收入及支出帳目\n\n截至二零一五年十二月三十一日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 結匯基金 – 全面收益表\n\n截至二零一五年十二月三十一日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 結匯基金 –  балансовий звіт\n\n於二零一五年十二月三十一日為止\n\n陳德霖\n香港金融管理局\n二零一六年四月七日\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 匯豐基金 – 權益變動表\n\n截至二零一五年十二月三十一日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 結匯基金 – 現金流量表\n\n截至二零一五年十二月三十一日止年度\n\n# 結匯基金 – 現金流量表（續頁）\n\n截至二零一五年十二月三十一日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 匯豐基金－財務報表附註\n\n（金額以百萬港元為單位，除非另有說明。）\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長 selaku 匯豐儲備基金（「基金」）監管人的授權，按照《匯豐儲備基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是保障港幣的匯價，並維持香港的貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全。\n\n本基金的資產以四個投資組合管理：即後盾投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及策略投資組合。後盾投資組合的資產完全與香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎相符。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股權市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該股份由香港特別行政區政府代表本基金出資購入，以作策略用途。經營分部資料載於附註31。\n\n# 重要會計政策\n\n## 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據香港財務報告準則（香港財務報告準則為涵蓋所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（香港會計準則）及香港會計師公會（香港會計師公會）發佈的解釋的統稱）編製，並符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）所採納的重大會計政策摘要載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，於本會計期間首次生效或可供提早採用。附註三載列本集團於本及過往會計期間內，因首次採用這些發展而導致的會計政策變動（如有），且這些變動與本財務報表所反映的會計期間相關。\n\n# 匯豐基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以百萬港元為單位，除非另有說明。）\n\n## 2.2 財務報表編制基礎\n\n本集團財務報表包括本集團之財務報表以及本集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註十六及十七。\n\n財務報表之編製所採用之衡量基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按後述會計政策所說明之公平價值列示：\n\n交易金融工具（附註 2.6.2.1）；\n以公允價值衡量之金融資產與金融負債（附註 2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（附註 2.6.2.5）；\n黃金（附註 2.11）；及\n投資性不動產（附註 2.12）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。這些估計和相關假設乃基於經驗及管理層認為在當時情況下屬合理的各種其他因素，其結果構成判斷資產和負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非容易從其他來源得知。實際結果可能與這些估計存在差異。\n\n估計和相關假設會持續進行檢討。會計估計的修訂，若僅影響該修訂期間，則於該期間認列；若影響當期及未來期間，則於修訂期間及未來期間認列。\n\n附註十八載列有關投資物業公平價值估計所用假設的資料。附註三十七載列有關金融工具公平價值估計所用假設的資料。除如附註二點五所列的某些金融工具估值外，本集團應用會計政策並未涉及關鍵會計判斷。\n\n## 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由本集團控制的實體。本集團於其與該實體的參與中，若能承受或擁有來自該實體的變動回報，並有能力透過對該實體的權力影響該等回報，則被視為控制該實體。評估本集團是否擁有權力時，僅會考慮實質權利（由本集團及其他各方持有）。\n\n# 匯豐基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（金額以百萬港元為單位，除非另有說明。）\n\n對子公司的投資自取得控制權之日起至喪失控制權之日止，併入本集團財務報表。\n\n集團財務報表編製時，會全面消除集團內各公司之間的結餘、交易、現金流量以及因集團內交易產生的任何未實現利潤和虧損。\n\n非控制性股權代表基金並未直接或間接持有的子公司股權，且本集團並未與該等股權持有人協定任何額外條款，導致本集團整體就該等股權產生符合財務負債定義的合約義務。非控制性股權於本集團資產負債表中權益部分列示，與歸屬於基金擁有人之權益分開呈現。本集團業績中非控制性股權於本集團損益表及綜合收益表中以分配當年盈餘或虧損以及綜合收益或損失予非控制性股權及基金擁有人之方式呈現。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去任何減值損失列示（附註2.14）。\n\n## 2.4 聯營公司與合資企業\n\n聯營公司是指本集團雖未對其管理擁有控制權或共同控制權，但因能參與其財務及營運方針決策，而對其具有重大影響力的實體。\n"}
