{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2020年可謂是超乎想像的一年。\n\n新冠病毒疫情肆虐全球，令人措手不及，世界各地的經濟活動幾乎陷於停頓。在疫情的打擊下，香港經濟繼2019年後連續第二年收縮，本地生產總值錄得有紀錄以來的最大跌幅。失業率飆升至16年高位，部分行業尤其受到重創。\n\n然而，困境往往是展現我們實力的時候。儘管面對重重挑戰，香港的貨幣及銀行體系再次成功抵禦衝擊。這一切絕非偶然，而是我們多年來一直奉行審慎政策的成果。\n\n復甦前路難望平坦。即使各地央行及政府都全力支持經濟，但前景仍充滿不確定性，包括央行的貨幣政策立場、疫苗接種計劃的進展，以及長期低息環境的潛在影響。另一方面，地緣政治緊張局勢變化不斷，令宏觀形勢更添變數。\n\n縱使面對如此不明朗的形勢，金管局會繼續緊守崗位，維持貨幣及金融穩定，締造有利經濟復甦的環境。與此同時，在不斷演變的銀行及金融業大環境下，我們亦會致力把握機會，提升香港作為全球金融樞紐的競爭力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）在2020年繼續暢順有序地運作。聯匯制度自1983年實施至今，渡過一次又一次的難關，充分展現出抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管面對疫情及波動的宏觀經濟環境，年內港元匯率一直保持平穩。強方兌換保證合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入約3,835億港元。\n\n聯匯制度得以維持穩健，全賴多年來所建立的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2020年對外部門報告》中的總結指出，聯匯制度的公信力建基於具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管、靈活的經濟及審慎的財政制度。同時，金管局透過與業界緊密聯繫，以及透過傳統及社交媒體與公眾有效溝通，迅速澄清謠言，並適時提供有關事實與數據的最新資訊。金管局亦利用最新的科技與數據分析技術，繼續提升監察能力，以靈活應對最新市況及新出現的風險。\n\n雖然疫情對經濟造成沉重壓力，但銀行體系維持穩健，資本及流動資金充裕。於2020年底，本地銀行的資本充足比率為20.7%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。大型銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%，於2020年第4季達到155.1%。受疫情影響，銀行的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2020年底上升至0.9%，但仍屬穩健並遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟命脈\n\n銀行體系在經濟與社會中扮演重要的金融中介角色。年內金管局一方面繼續重點監管銀行的信用及流動性風險，另一方面亦密切留意疫情對銀行營運的影響，並採取多項措施，確保銀行體系能繼續提供基本服務，以及提供貸款支持經濟。金管局在3月下調逆周期緩衝資本比率100基點至1%，又在4月調低監管儲備水平。這些措施為銀行體系合共釋放約1萬億港元的借貸空間。\n\n我們深知中小企在當前的經濟環境下或會面對資金周轉壓力。因此，金管局聯同我們在2019年成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制推出多輪紓困措施，包括「預先批核還息不還本」計劃，將合資格企業的所有貸款本金還款延期6個月。截至2020年底，銀行共批出超過58,000宗貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉資超過7,400億港元。鑑於疫情反覆，金管局因應情況將「預先批核還息不還本」計劃展期，並於2021年3月將計劃延長至2021年10月底。香港按揭證券有限公司亦在其中小企融資擔保計劃下推出「百分百擔保特惠貸款」，以紓緩中小企支付僱員薪金及租金的負擔。截至2020年底，共批出超過25,000宗申請，涉資約400億港元。該計劃在2021年第1季作出優化，申請期限亦延長至2021年12月31日。年內銀行亦批出超過28,000宗紓困措施申請，協助個人客戶的資金周轉，涉資440億港元。銀行業同心協力，支持企業及個人客戶，共渡時艱，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續推動銀行業加強普及金融與實踐「以客為本」的文化。我們進一步鼓勵銀行格外留意有需要的客戶，並與銀行分享多方面的良好做法，包括為智障人士提供銀行服務，以及提供更多無障礙及方便易用的銀行服務。\n\n隨着科技長足發展，銀行業的經營環境亦急速轉變。因此，金管局的工作不僅限於應對當前的挑戰，亦要放眼未來，擴大人才庫，以配合銀行業的日後發展。我們與香港銀行公會及香港銀行學會聯合展開「提升未來銀行業人才的專業能力」研究計劃，評估銀行業未來幾年的潛在人才缺口，並為銀行規劃清晰的路線圖，以期未雨綢繆，改善人才供應的情況。我們又推出「銀行業人才起動計劃」，為本地大學的應屆畢業生提供為期6個月的實習機會及銀行業相關的特定培訓，藉以為業界培育人才。在本港勞工市場的嚴峻時期推出此計劃，亦正好為有志加入銀行業的年青人提供機會。\n\n# 國際金融中心地位：無懼挑戰\n\n為履行金管局其中一項重要職責，協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，我們的未來規劃涵蓋銀行體系以至整個金融體系，旨在讓香港在不斷演變的金融環境中能夠保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力。在疫情期間，我們仍然穩步推進這些工作，並在幾個重點範疇積極開拓新機遇，以充分把握新趨勢及轉變的契機。\n\n# 推動綠色金融，締造更可持續的未來\n\n第一個範疇是推動綠色及可持續金融。自2019年5月推出分三階段進行的措施以來，相關工作已取得理想進展。我們在2020年完成對47間銀行的「綠色基準」評估，發表白皮書及發出通告，就銀行管理氣候風險提供指引及分享經驗。我們亦全力推進第二階段的工作，制定銀行業管理氣候風險的監管架構。此外，我們會致力在2025年或之前按照氣候相關財務披露工作小組的建議，要求銀行就氣候相關資料作出披露。這將使香港成為亞洲區內首個作出相關具體要求的地區。\n\n金管局作為全球最大的儲備管理人之一，我們積極將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素納入甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的程序。我們亦身體力行作出ESG投資，包括投資於綠色、社會及可持續債券和低碳項目。\n\n為進一步發展香港的綠色金融生態圈，金管局一直協助政府發行綠色債券，而最近發行的第二批政府綠色債券更大受國際投資者歡迎。乘着這個發展趨勢，財政司司長在《2021至22年度財政預算案》中宣布政府會擴大「政府綠色債券計劃」的規模，將借款上限提升一倍至2,000億港元，並會增加日後發行的綠色債券的種類與發行渠道。\n\n為鞏固香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐，我們整體策略的其中一環，是與本地其他監管機構及國際社會合作，推進綠色金融議程。在本地方面，金管局聯同其他監管機構成立綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組，協調金融業的相關措施。該小組已經制定策略性計劃，促進香港的綠色及可持續金融的發展。在國際方面，金管局應國際金融公司的邀請，成為亞洲區域創始成員及首個區域執行理事，與其合力推動「綠色商業銀行聯盟」。聯盟旨在於全球金融市場推動綠色銀行業，並由亞洲開始，逐步擴展至其他地區。\n\n我們期望上述工作有助減低金融業面對的氣候風險，以及促進本港銀行發揮優勢，滿足區內綠色投資的龐大資金需求。\n\n# 金融科技方便市民，裨益經濟\n\n推動金融業增長的另一個主要引擎是金融科技，而在新冠病毒疫情下，這方面的步伐更見加速。\n\n過去一年清楚顯示，金融科技能夠擴展我們的「工具箱」，以應對突如其來的衝擊。面對新冠病毒疫情，電子支付渠道發揮了前所未見的作用。自2018年9月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」至2020年底期間，「轉數快」已錄得690萬個登記賬戶。即使在社交距離措施的限制下，公眾仍能利用「轉數快」這個安全快捷及穩妥的方式收付及轉撥資金，令「轉數快」的平均每日交易量在2020年急增2.3倍。我們亦一直與政府合作，將「轉數快」的應用範圍擴大至繳付更多種政府及公共服務帳單。\n\n此外，金融科技亦有助銀行提供更多元化及便利的銀行客戶服務。獲金管局發牌的所有8間虛擬銀行年內已經全數在香港開業。截至2020年底，在虛擬銀行開設的帳戶共有420,000個，總計客戶存款150億港元。其中部分虛擬銀行已經率先使用新類型數據進行信貸評估，以開拓新的客戶群及促進普及金融。金管局繼續推動在香港發展更具規模及更多元化的合規科技生態圈，作為「銀行易」措施的一部分，從而精簡監管規定，提升客戶體驗。除透過刊發通訊系列，以提高業界對合規科技應用的認知外，金管局亦發表白皮書，載述加快銀行業採用合規科技的兩年計劃。另外，金管局又展開「商業數據通」項目，以便中小企利用自身的數碼足跡更便捷地獲取銀行融資。\n\n金融科技面貌日新月異，科技應用亦日趨普及，金管局需繼續秉持嚴謹的監管。為此，我們推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，以提高銀行的網絡防衛能力。我們亦加強對科技風險管理的現場審查，並制定監管框架，評估運用創新信用風險評估方法的個人貸款產品的信用風險。金管局亦展開監管科技應用的三年計劃，以提升監管流程的成效及前瞻性。我們現正進行的有關工作包括更有效地利用數據及科技來加強反洗錢方面的監管。\n","en":"# President's Report\n\n2020 was truly a year beyond imagination.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, catching everyone off guard and bringing economic activity to a near standstill worldwide. Under the impact of the pandemic, Hong Kong’s economy contracted for the second consecutive year following 2019, recording its largest drop on record in terms of gross domestic product. The unemployment rate soared to a 16-year high, with certain industries particularly hard hit.\n\nHowever, adversity often reveals our true strength. Despite facing numerous challenges, Hong Kong’s monetary and banking system has once again successfully withstood the shocks. This was by no means accidental, but rather the result of our consistently prudent policies over the years.\n\nThe path to recovery remains challenging and far from smooth. Despite full support from central banks and governments worldwide, the outlook remains highly uncertain, encompassing factors such as the stance of monetary policy by central banks, the progress of vaccination programs, and the potential impacts of a prolonged low-interest-rate environment. Furthermore, constantly evolving geopolitical tensions add further variables to the macroeconomic landscape.\n\nEven facing such an uncertain situation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to diligently fulfill its responsibilities, maintaining monetary and financial stability, and creating an environment conducive to economic recovery. At the same time, amidst the constantly evolving banking and financial landscape, we will also strive to seize opportunities and enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a global financial hub.\n\n# Currency and Financial Stability: Steadfast as Ever\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) continued to operate smoothly and orderly in 2020. Since its implementation in 1983, the LERS has weathered numerous challenges, fully demonstrating its ability to withstand shocks. Despite the pandemic and a volatile macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. The strong-side conversion undertakings were triggered a total of 85 times, resulting in a cumulative inflow of approximately HK$383.5 billion.\n\nThe linked exchange rate system has remained stable thanks to the solid foundations built up over many years. As summarized in the International Monetary Fund’s “2020 External Sector Report,” the credibility of the linked exchange rate system is based on transparent operating rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation, a flexible economy, and prudent fiscal policies. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close contact with the industry and effectively communicates with the public through traditional and social media, swiftly clarifying rumors and providing the latest facts and data when appropriate. The HKMA also leverages the latest technology and data analytics to continuously enhance its monitoring capabilities, allowing it to flexibly respond to the latest market conditions and emerging risks.\n\nDespite the significant pressure the pandemic placed on the economy, the banking system remained stable with ample capital and liquidity. At the end of 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks was 20.7%, significantly exceeding the international minimum requirement of 8%. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks also far surpassed the statutory minimum requirement of 100%, reaching 155.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Affected by the pandemic, the asset quality of banks deteriorated slightly, with the ratio of loans in specific categories rising to 0.9% at the end of 2020, but remained sound and well below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# The Banking System: The Lifeline of the Economy\n\nThe banking system plays a crucial financial intermediary role in the economy and society. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to focus on supervising credit and liquidity risks within banks, while also closely monitoring the impact of the epidemic on banking operations. It implemented a number of measures to ensure the banking system could continue to provide essential services and offer loan support to the economy. In March, the HKMA lowered the countercyclical capital buffer ratio by 100 basis points to 1%, and in April, it reduced the required reserve ratio. These measures collectively released approximately HK$1 trillion in lending capacity for the banking system.\n\nWe fully understand that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may face financial pressures in the current economic environment. To this end, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the banking sector, launched the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism in 2019 and subsequently introduced multiple relief measures, including the “Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday” scheme, which deferred principal repayments on all eligible loans for six months. As of the end of 2020, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures, involving more than HK$740 billion. Given the fluctuating pandemic situation, the HKMA extended the “Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday” scheme as appropriate and further extended it to October 31, 2021, in March 2021. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation also launched the “100% Guarantee Special Loan” under its SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to alleviate the burden on SMEs in paying employee salaries and rent. As of the end of 2020, over 25,000 applications had been approved, involving approximately HK$40 billion. The scheme was enhanced in the first quarter of 2021, and the application period was also extended to December 31, 2021. Banks also approved over 28,000 relief measure applications within the year, assisting individual customers with their cash flow, involving HK$44 billion. The concerted efforts of the banking sector in supporting corporate and individual customers through these difficult times are truly encouraging.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to promote the banking industry’s efforts to popularize financial inclusion and embrace a “customer-centric” culture. We further encourage banks to pay particular attention to customers in need and share best practices with them in various areas, including providing banking services for people with intellectual disabilities, as well as offering more accessible and user-friendly banking services.\n\nWith the rapid advancement of technology, the operating environment for the banking industry is also undergoing rapid transformation. Therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work is not limited to responding to current challenges, but also extends to looking ahead and expanding the talent pool to align with the future development of the banking industry. We have jointly launched the “Enhancing Professional Capabilities of Future Banking Professionals” research project with the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Institute of Banking, to assess the potential talent gap in the banking industry over the next few years and to develop a clear roadmap for banks to proactively address and improve the talent supply situation. We have also launched the “Banking Talent Development Scheme,” offering local university graduates six-month internship opportunities and specific training related to the banking industry, thereby fostering talent for the sector. Launching this scheme during a challenging period in the Hong Kong labor market also provides opportunities for young people who aspire to join the banking industry.\n\n# International Financial Centre Status: Undaunted by Challenges\n\nTo fulfill one of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s key responsibilities – assisting in the consolidation of Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre – our future plans encompass the banking system and the entire financial system, aiming to ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial centre in an evolving financial landscape. Throughout the pandemic, we continued to steadily advance these efforts and proactively explored new opportunities in several key areas to fully capitalize on emerging trends and transformations.\n\n# Promoting green finance to create a more sustainable future.\n\nThe first area of focus is promoting green and sustainable finance. Since the launch of measures in May 2019, implemented in three phases, good progress has been made in related work. We completed a “Green Reference” assessment of 47 banks in 2020, published a white paper, and issued a circular providing guidance and sharing experience on how banks manage climate-related risks. We are also fully pushing forward with the second phase of work, developing a regulatory framework for banks to manage climate-related risks. Furthermore, we are committed to requiring banks to make disclosures on climate-related data by 2025 or earlier, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. This will make Hong Kong the first place in Asia to introduce such specific requirements.\n\nAs one of the world’s largest reserve managers, we actively integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into our processes for selecting, appointing and monitoring external investment managers. We also practice what we preach by making ESG investments, including investments in green, social and sustainable bonds and low-carbon projects.\n\nTo further develop Hong Kong’s green finance ecosystem, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been assisting the government in issuing green bonds, with the recently issued second batch of government green bonds proving particularly popular with international investors. Capitalizing on this development trend, the Financial Secretary announced in the 2021-22 Budget that the government would expand the scope of the “Government Green Bond Programme,” doubling the borrowing ceiling to HK$200 billion, and increase the variety and issuance channels of future green bonds.\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance, a key component of our overall strategy is to collaborate with local regulatory authorities and the international community to advance the green finance agenda. Locally, the HKMA, together with other regulators, has established the Cross-agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance to coordinate relevant initiatives in the financial industry. This group has already formulated a strategic plan to promote the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong. Internationally, the HKMA has accepted the invitation of the International Finance Corporation to become a founding member and the first regional executive council member for the Asia region, working with them to promote the “Green Banking Partnership.” The partnership aims to promote green banking in global financial markets, starting in Asia and gradually expanding to other regions.\n\nWe hope that the above work will help reduce the climate risks facing the financial industry and enable Hong Kong banks to leverage their strengths to meet the substantial funding needs for green investment in the region.\n\n# Financial technology facilitates citizens’ lives and benefits the economy.\n\nAnother major driver of growth in the financial industry is financial technology, and the pace of this has accelerated even further under the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe past year has clearly demonstrated that financial technology can expand our toolkit to address sudden shocks. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic payment channels played an unprecedented role. From its launch in September 2018 to the end of 2020, the Faster Payment System (FPS), known as “Transfer Quick,” had already registered 6.9 million accounts. Even with social distancing measures in place, the public was able to utilize “Transfer Quick” as a secure, fast, and reliable way to receive and make payments and transfer funds, leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the average daily transaction volume in 2020. We have also been working with the government to expand the application of “Transfer Quick” to cover the payment of a wider range of government and public service bills.\n\nFurthermore, financial technology also helps banks provide more diversified and convenient banking services to customers. All eight virtual banks licensed by the HKMA have fully launched operations in Hong Kong within the year. As of the end of 2020, a total of 420,000 accounts had been opened with virtual banks, with aggregate customer deposits reaching HK$15 billion. Some virtual banks have already pioneered the use of new types of data for credit assessment, in order to expand their customer base and promote financial inclusion. The HKMA continues to promote the development of a larger and more diversified regulatory technology (RegTech) ecosystem in Hong Kong, as part of the “Banking Easy” initiatives, to streamline regulatory requirements and enhance customer experience. In addition to issuing communication series to raise industry awareness of RegTech applications, the HKMA has also published a white paper outlining a two-year plan to accelerate the adoption of RegTech in the banking sector. Moreover, the HKMA has launched the “Commercial Data Interchange” project to facilitate SMEs in obtaining bank financing more easily by leveraging their digital footprints.\n\nThe landscape of financial technology is rapidly evolving, and the application of technology is becoming increasingly widespread. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority must continue to maintain prudent supervision. To this end, we are launching \"Cyber Resilience Assessment 2.0\" to enhance the cyber resilience of banks. We are also strengthening on-site supervision of technology risk management and developing a regulatory framework to assess the credit risk of personal loan products utilizing innovative credit risk assessment methods. The HKMA has also launched a three-year plan to apply regulatory technology, with the aim of improving the efficiency and forward-looking capabilities of our supervisory processes. Current work underway includes the more effective use of data and technology to strengthen anti-money laundering supervision.\n"}

The labor market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased. To address the severe economic environment, the government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched relief measures to support the economy.\n\nDespite numerous challenges, the banking system in Hong Kong remains stable with sound financial conditions and continued deposit growth. Capital and liquidity remain ample, and asset quality remains at a healthy level.\n\n# Currency stability\n\nDespite the increased uncertainty brought about by the pandemic, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets operated smoothly and in an orderly manner, reflecting the continued solidity of Hong Kong’s monetary system. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained strong for much of 2020, triggering the Convertibility Undertaking on multiple occasions. This fully demonstrates the robustness of the linked exchange rate system and market confidence in it.\n\n# Banking system stable.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is closely monitoring the impact of the epidemic on banking operations while continuing to focus on supervising banks’ credit and liquidity risk management. Given the continuing increase in cyber risks and the industry’s accelerating adoption of technology, the HKMA is strengthening its supervision of banks’ technology risk management and operational resilience, as well as the protection of consumers of digital financial services.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has provided banks with flexibility to allow them to continue serving customers during the pandemic. The HKMA has also jointly formulated with other relevant authorities the implementation details for the pilot scheme for \"Cross-border Wealth Management Connect\" and issued guidance on family office and wealth management business.\n\nIn combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the HKMA has taken swift action, clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help banks respond more effectively to situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continues to promote public-private information sharing and support the banking industry’s adoption of RegTech.\n\nSeveral new rules and regulations to strengthen the supervision of the banking system will be launched within the year to align with the latest international standards. Regarding green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second of three phases and is developing related regulatory requirements. The HKMA is also committed to formulating resolution standards, conducting resolution planning, and establishing resolution execution capabilities to ensure Hong Kong has a credible banking resolution mechanism.\n\n# Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote the development of the financial technology ecosystem, with increasing adoption of financial technology by the banking and payments industries. Transaction volume on the Faster Payment System, “Faster Payments,” has surged. The HKMA is actively participating in cross-border collaboration in areas such as central bank digital currencies.\n\nHong Kong’s position as a global offshore RMB business hub remains solid and continues to serve as a key gateway to mainland China. Financial connections between Hong Kong and the mainland continue to strengthen through its world-class market infrastructure and connectivity mechanisms. Good progress was also made in the development of the Greater Bay Area throughout the year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance Hong Kong’s financial platform, including strengthening the competitiveness of its asset and wealth management businesses and its capabilities in green and sustainable finance.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nDespite a complex and volatile investment landscape, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, with a return rate of 5.3%, and all five major investment classes generated positive returns.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote responsible investment and asset diversification. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 13.7% since the commencement of investment in 2009.\n\n# Institutional Functions and Social Responsibility\n\nThroughout the year, the HKMA continued to maintain effective communication with the community and the market through various channels, enhancing public understanding of the HKMA’s policies and operations. In performing its duties, the HKMA upholds a very high standard of corporate governance, supports staff in enhancing their professional capabilities, strictly controls finances, and strengthens information technology capabilities and security to address new challenges and projects, as well as an increasing workload.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to be committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, striving to be a responsible and sustainable institution. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA implemented special work arrangements to ensure the continued normal operation of its essential functions while safeguarding the health of its staff. The HKMA also launched a number of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic.\n"}

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n面對新冠病毒疫情，香港經濟在2020 年連續第二年收縮，並錄得歷年來最嚴重的跌幅。消費及旅遊相關行業尤其受到重創，其收縮幅度較整體經濟更大。與此同時，勞工市場急速惡化，通脹有所緩和。政府及金管局為應對嚴峻的經濟環境，推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施以支持經濟。新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期2021年經濟會恢復增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展以及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體經濟活動\n\n受新冠病毒疫情打擊，香港經濟在2020年收縮6.1%，是連續第二年收縮，亦是有紀錄以來最嚴重的年度跌幅（表1）。經濟活動急跌主要是本地需求急劇收縮所致（圖1）。疫情爆發及相應的社交距離措施令本地消費活動受到重創。由於營商環境轉差，整體投資支出亦明顯減少。對外方面，儘管疫情導致供應鏈受干擾及全球需求萎縮，但部分受惠於中國內地迅速恢復生產和經濟活動，全年合計香港貨物出口僅略為下降。相比之下，由於封城、關閉邊境及旅客流量限制令全球旅遊業陷入停頓，所以香港服務輸出嚴重受挫。本地及轉口帶動的需求疲弱，亦令貨物進口及服務輸入轉差。由於進口總額下跌步伐較出口快，淨出口（貿易順差）為本地生產總值帶來支持（圖1）。按經濟行業分析，消費及旅遊相關行業，例如零售、住宿及膳食服務業受到的打擊尤其嚴重，收縮情況較整體經濟更差，而金融業則溫和增長。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n# 經濟及金融環境\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n\n政府為應對疫情，透過2020至21年度《財政預算案》迅速推出歷來最大規模的紓困措施，並從「防疫抗疫基金」發放4輪補助，合共超過3,000億港元。這些措施包括向合資格居民發放一筆過10,000港元現金、透過「保就業」計劃提供工資補貼，以及為受疫情重創的行業提供一筆過資助、寬減租金及豁免收費。金管局則採取三管齊下的方式支持銀行業，從而支撐實體經濟。有關措施包括與銀行業積極協調，減輕企業及家庭的資金周轉壓力，釋放緩衝以提高銀行的借貸能力，並確保銀行有足夠流動性支持本地經濟活動。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2020年明顯減弱。剔除政府一次性紓困措施的影響，基本通脹率放緩至1.3%，是2009年全球金融危機以來最小的升幅。基本食品（尤其新鮮豬肉）的價格壓力明顯減退；而自行烹煮以外，由於飲食業提供大幅度折扣，所以外出用膳的價格在下半年亦有所下降。隨着早前新簽訂的私人住宅租金回落，消費物價指數租金項目的增長亦回軟（圖2）。更廣泛而言，由於名義工資增長減慢及商業樓宇租金偏軟，本地營商成本壓力減少；而在疲弱的全球經濟狀況下，進口價格通脹有所緩和。\n\n圖 2 基本消費物價通脹\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2020年急速惡化。經季節性調整的失業率年內由3.3%飆升至6.6%，為16年的高位（圖3），其中零售、住宿及膳食服務等受疫情重創行業的失業率達到10%以上。就業不足率亦於8月升至3.8%，為沙士疫情後的高位。部分由於經濟狀況急速惡化造成的周期性反應，勞動人口參與率輕微減少。總就業人數（圖3）及私營機構職位空缺急跌，反映整體勞工需求進一步收縮。名義工資及收入增長進一步放緩。政府推出「保就業」計劃，為僱主提供有時限的財政支援以保留僱員，使勞工市場獲得一定程度的支持。\n\n圖 3 勞工市場狀況\n\n# 股市\n\n隨着新冠病毒疫情爆發，恒生指數在首季急跌至3年低位。繼各國中央銀行及政府推出大型支持措施後，股市在第2季及第3季略為回穩（圖4）。由於新冠病毒疫苗研發出現突破，股市於接近年底時重拾一些上升動力。恒生指數於年底收報27,231點，全年計錄得3.4%跌幅。受惠於內地企業在香港的第二上市活動，2020年本港首次公開招股集資總額約4,000億港元，以集資額計全球排名第二。\n\n圖 4 資產價格\n\n# 物業市場\n\n部分受到超低利率所支持，住宅物業市場在2020年大致平穩（圖4）。整體樓價及成交量較前一年均無大變動。然而，由於家庭住戶入息減少，置業負擔能力更為偏緊。另一方面，非住宅物業市場進一步轉弱，物業價格錄得不同程度跌幅，成交量亦見底。受經濟下滑及空置率上升的影響，寫字樓及零售物業租金大幅下跌。鑑於2019年以來非住宅物業市場已出現大幅調整，並預期會持續受壓，加上考慮到經濟基調及外圍環境等其他因素，金管局於8月調整非住宅物業的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施。政府因應市場需求回落，亦於11月撤銷購置非住宅物業的雙倍從價印花稅這項需求管理措施。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n新冠病毒疫苗接種可望使經濟活動回復正常，預期香港經濟在2021年（全年合計）重拾正增長，然而經濟復甦的力度及步伐仍受疫情發展及疫苗供應、覆蓋範圍和成效等眾多不明朗因素影響。具體而言，疫苗廣泛接種需時，因此本地經濟在2021年早段仍面對相當程度的挑戰。對外方面，預計內地經濟會進一步增強，並為香港貨物及服務輸出帶來支持，然而其他主要經濟體的復甦步伐將取決於其大規模接種疫苗計劃的成效。政府預測2021年實質本地生產總值增長率介乎3.5至5.5%之間，與國際組織及私營機構分析員對香港最新的增長預測平均4.4%相符。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n鑑於環球及本地經濟狀況仍具挑戰，預期2021年的通脹壓力將維持輕微。此外，早前新簽訂私人住宅租金回落的傳遞效應，將繼續令本地通脹受到抑制。市場共識預測2021年整體通脹率為1.5%，而政府預期整體及基本通脹率分別為1.6%及1%。由於經濟前景在2021年早段仍具挑戰，加上私營機構分析員預計2021年全年失業率仍會在約5.9%的偏高水平，因此短期內勞工市場將繼續受壓。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n香港銀行體系在2020年保持穩健，銀行財務狀況良好。儘管新冠病毒疫情帶來挑戰，銀行資產負債表繼續擴大，存款資金增加。銀行體系資本及流動性狀況維持充裕，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處穩健水平。\n\n# 資產負債表走勢\n\n2020年銀行體系資產負債表擴大5.7%。由於經濟下滑，年內貸款增長減慢至1.2%，相比2019年的增幅為6.7%；其中在香港使用的貸款增加2.2%，在香港境外使用的貸款微增0.1%，貿易融資減少6.2%。2020年中國內地相關貸款微跌0.2%，相比2019年錄得7.4%的增長。\n\n銀行資產負債表的負債方面，存款總額在2020年增加5.4%，相比2019年的增幅為2.9%。由於存款總額增長較貸款總額快，整體貸存比率由2019年底的75.3% 降至 2020 年底的 72.3%（圖 5）。\n\n圖 5 銀行體系的貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足水平\n\n2020年銀行體系資本狀況維持穩健，為抵禦潛在衝擊提供強大的緩衝。2020年底本地註冊認可機構的綜合總資本比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，為20.7%。一級資本比率於同期由18.5%微升至18.7%（圖 6）。\n\n2020年底《巴塞爾協定三》槓桿比率與2019年底相比維持穩定，仍為8.2%，遠高於3%的法定最低要求（圖 7）。\n\n圖 6 本地註冊認可機構的綜合資本比率\n\n圖 7 本地註冊認可機構的綜合槓桿比率\n\n# 流動性狀況\n\n銀行體系的流動性狀況維持穩健，有能力抵禦受壓時的流動性衝擊。第1類機構的季度平均流動性覆蓋比率在第4季為155.1%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2類機構的季度平均流動性維持比率為57.9%，亦遠高於25%的法定最低要求（圖 8）。\n\n圖 8 指定認可機構的流動性比率\n\n銀行體系的資金來源維持穩定。於2020年底，第1類機構的穩定資金淨額比率為138.6%，遠高於100%的法定最低要求。第2A類機構的核心資金比率為139.5%，亦遠高於75%的法定最低要求（圖 9）。\n\n圖 9 指定認可機構的資金比率\n\n# 資產質素\n\n新冠病毒疫情影響下，年內銀行體系資產質素略為下降，但以歷史及國際標準計仍然維持良好。特定分類貸款比率由2019年底的0.57%上升至2020年底的0.90%，逾期及經重組貸款比率於同期由0.34%上升至0.57%（圖10）。中國內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由 2019 年底的 0.75% 上升至 2020 年底的 0.96%。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率仍然處於低位，分別為0.04%及0.27%（圖11）。\n\n圖 10 銀行體系的資產質素\n\n圖 11 住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的拖欠比率\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n低息環境加上資產質素略為下降，令銀行體系盈利受壓。零售銀行的整體除稅前經營溢利在2020年下降29.4%（圖12），主要是淨利息收入減少（-21.9%）及貸款減值撥備增加（+61.3%）所致。淨息差由2019年的1.63% 收窄至 2020 年的 1.18%（圖 13）。\n\n由於收入減少，零售銀行的成本與收入比率由2019年的39.5%，上升至2020年的46.8%（圖 14）。\n\n圖 12 零售銀行的表現\n\n圖 13 零售銀行淨息差\n\n圖 14 零售銀行成本與收入比率\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFacing the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong’s economy contracted for the second consecutive year in 2020, recording its most severe decline on record. The consumption and tourism-related sectors were particularly hard hit, with their contraction exceeding that of the overall economy. Simultaneously, the labor market deteriorated rapidly, while inflation eased somewhat. To address the challenging economic environment, the Government and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the largest relief measures to date to support the economy. COVID-19 vaccination is expected to allow economic activity to return to normal, and the economy is forecast to resume growth in 2021. However, the strength and pace of the economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the pandemic and the supply, coverage, and effectiveness of vaccines.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real economy activities\n\nHit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong’s economy contracted by 6.1% in 2020, marking the second consecutive year of decline and the largest annual drop on record (Table 1). The sharp fall in economic activity was primarily attributable to a drastic contraction in local demand (Figure 1). The outbreak of the pandemic and the associated social distancing measures severely impacted local consumption. Coupled with a deteriorating business environment, overall investment expenditure also decreased significantly. On the external front, despite supply chain disruptions and a contraction in global demand caused by the pandemic, merchandise exports for the whole year saw only a slight decrease, partly benefiting from the rapid resumption of production and economic activity in Mainland China. In contrast, Hong Kong’s service exports were severely hampered as lockdowns, border closures, and travel restrictions brought global tourism to a standstill. Weak demand from both local sources and re-exports also led to a deterioration in imports of goods and services. As the pace of decline in total imports was faster than that of exports, net exports (trade surplus) provided support to Gross Domestic Product (Figure 1). By economic sector, consumer and tourism-related industries, such as retail, accommodation, and food and beverage services, were particularly hard hit, contracting more severely than the overall economy, while the financial industry experienced moderate growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Item (Comparison with Previous Period)\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nFigure 1: Contribution to Real GDP Growth by Component\n\nTo address the epidemic, the government swiftly launched the largest relief package in history through the Financial Budget for 2020-21, disbursing over HK$300 billion in four rounds of subsidies from the “Anti-epidemic Fund.” These measures included a one-off cash handout of HK$10,000 to eligible residents, wage subsidies through the “Employment Support Scheme,” and one-off grants, rent reductions, and fee waivers for industries severely impacted by the epidemic. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in turn, supported the banking sector through a three-pronged approach to bolster the real economy. These measures included actively coordinating with banks to alleviate financial pressure on businesses and households, releasing buffers to enhance banks’ lending capacity, and ensuring banks had sufficient liquidity to support local economic activity.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures eased noticeably in 2020. Excluding the effect of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate slowed to 1.3%, the smallest increase since the global financial crisis in 2009. Price pressures on basic food items (particularly fresh pork) diminished significantly; and the prices of eating out also fell in the second half of the year, thanks to substantial discounts offered by the catering industry, apart from cooking at home. Growth in the rental component of the Consumer Price Index also softened, following the recent signing of new private residential leases at lower rents (Figure 2). More broadly, local business operating costs decreased as nominal wage growth slowed and commercial building rents remained subdued; and import price inflation moderated against the backdrop of a weak global economic environment.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation\n\n# Labor market\n\nThe labor market deteriorated rapidly in 2020. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate surged from 3.3% to 6.6% within the year, reaching a 16-year high (Figure 3). Unemployment rates in sectors severely impacted by the epidemic, such as retail, accommodation, and food and beverage services, exceeded 10%. The underemployment rate also rose to 3.8% in August, the highest level since the SARS outbreak. Labor force participation rate decreased slightly, partly due to the cyclical reaction to the rapid deterioration of the economic situation. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies fell sharply, reflecting a further contraction in overall labor demand. Nominal wage and income growth continued to slow. The government launched the “Employment Protection Scheme,” providing time-limited financial support to employers to retain employees, which provided a certain degree of support to the labor market.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions\n\n# Stock market\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hang Seng Index plummeted to a three-year low in the first quarter. After central banks and governments worldwide launched large-scale support measures, the stock market saw a slight recovery in the second and third quarters (Figure 4). Driven by breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccine development, the stock market regained some upward momentum towards the end of the year. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,231 points at year-end, recording an overall decrease of 3.4% for the year. Benefiting from secondary listings of mainland Chinese companies in Hong Kong, Hong Kong’s total IPO fundraising in 2020 reached approximately HK$400 billion, ranking second globally in terms of funds raised.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\n\n# Property Market\n\nSupported in part by ultra-low interest rates, the residential property market was generally stable in 2020 (Figure 4). Overall property prices and transaction volumes remained largely unchanged compared to the previous year. However, household incomes decreased, leading to a further tightening of affordability for potential homebuyers. On the other hand, the non-residential property market continued to weaken, with property prices falling to varying degrees and transaction volumes hitting rock bottom. Affected by the economic downturn and rising vacancy rates, rents for office and retail properties plummeted. Given the significant adjustment in the non-residential property market since 2019, and the expectation of continued pressure, coupled with consideration of the economic outlook and external environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for non-residential properties in August. In response to the decline in market demand, the government also abolished the double stamp duty on the purchase of non-residential properties – a demand-side management measure – in November.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination is expected to allow economic activity to return to normal, and the Hong Kong economy is forecast to return to positive growth in 2021 (full year). However, the strength and pace of the economic recovery remain subject to numerous uncertainties, including the development of the epidemic and vaccine supply, coverage, and effectiveness. Specifically, widespread vaccination will take time, and the local economy will continue to face considerable challenges in the first half of 2021. Externally, the Mainland China economy is expected to continue to strengthen, providing support for Hong Kong’s exports of goods and services. However, the pace of recovery in other major economies will depend on the effectiveness of their mass vaccination programs. The government forecasts that the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate in 2021 will be between 3.5% and 5.5%, consistent with the average growth forecast of 4.4% for Hong Kong by international organizations and private sector analysts.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nGiven the continuing challenges in the global and local economic situation, inflationary pressure is expected to remain mild in 2021. Furthermore, the lagged effect of the recently signed private residential rental decline will continue to suppress local inflation. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.5% for 2021, while the government anticipates overall and core inflation rates of 1.6% and 1% respectively. As the economic outlook remains challenging in the early part of 2021, coupled with private sector analysts predicting an unemployment rate remaining at a relatively high level of around 5.9% for the entire year, the labor market will continue to face pressure in the short term.\n\n# Banking System Performance\n\nHong Kong’s banking sector remained resilient in 2020, with banks in a sound financial condition. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, banks continued to expand their balance sheets and deposits increased. The banking sector maintained ample capital and liquidity, while asset quality deteriorated slightly but remained at a healthy level.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nIn 2020, the banking sector’s balance sheet expanded by 5.7%. Loan growth slowed to 1.2% during the year due to the economic downturn, compared to a growth rate of 6.7% in 2019. Specifically, loans used in Hong Kong increased by 2.2%, while loans used outside of Hong Kong saw a slight increase of 0.1%, and trade financing decreased by 6.2%. Loans related to mainland China saw a slight decrease of 0.2% in 2020, compared to a 7.4% increase in 2019.\n\nOn the liabilities side of bank balance sheets, total deposits increased by 5.4% in 2020, compared to a growth rate of 2.9% in 2019. As total deposit growth outpaced total loan growth, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 75.3% at the end of 2019 to 72.3% at the end of 2020 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits in the Banking System\n\n# Capital adequacy ratio\n\nThe banking sector maintained a robust capital position in 2020, providing a strong buffer against potential shocks. The consolidated capital adequacy ratio of locally registered and authorized institutions remained stable at 20.7% at the end of 2020, compared to the end of 2019. The Tier 1 capital ratio rose slightly from 18.5% to 18.7% over the same period (Figure 6).\n\nThe leverage ratio under Basel III remained stable at the end of 2020, holding steady at 8.2% compared to the end of 2019, and significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6: Composite Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered Accredited Institutions\n\nFigure 7: Aggregate Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Approved Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust and is capable of withstanding liquidity shocks under stress. The average liquidity coverage ratio for Category 1 institutions in the fourth quarter was 155.1%, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The average liquidity maintenance ratio for Category 2 institutions in the fourth quarter was 57.9%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Liquidity Ratios of Designated Accredited Institutions\n\nFunding sources for the banking system remained stable. At the end of 2020, Category 1 institutions had a net stable funding ratio of 138.6%, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Category 2A institutions had a core funding ratio of 139.5%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: Funding Ratios of Designated Accredited Institutions\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the asset quality of the banking system experienced a slight decline within the year, but remained sound by historical and international standards. The ratio of specific category loans rose from 0.57% at the end of 2019 to 0.90% at the end of 2020, while the ratio of overdue and restructured loans increased from 0.34% to 0.57% over the same period (Figure 10). The ratio of specific category loans for loans related to Mainland China increased from 0.75% at the end of 2019 to 0.96% at the end of 2020. Delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and credit card loans remained low, at 0.04% and 0.27% respectively (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 10: Asset Quality of the Banking System\n\nFigure 11: Mortgage Loan and Credit Card Loan Delinquency Ratios\n\n# Profit Trends\n\nLow interest rates coupled with a slight deterioration in asset quality put pressure on the profitability of the banking system. The overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banks decreased by 29.4% in 2020 (Figure 12), primarily due to a decrease in net interest income (-21.9%) and an increase in loan impairment provisions (+61.3%). Net interest margin narrowed from 1.63% in 2019 to 1.18% in 2020 (Figure 13).\n\nDue to declining revenue, the cost-to-income ratio for retail banks rose from 39.5% in 2019 to 46.8% in 2020 (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 12: Performance of Retail Banks\n\nFigure 13: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\n\nFigure 14: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情增加不確定因素，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。受到大量股票相關的資金流入所支持，港元匯率於2020 年內大部分時間偏強，而強方兌換保證多次被觸發。聯繫匯率制度是香港金融體系的基石，充分展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 設於金管局的結算戶口結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表 1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。當強方（或弱方）兌換保證被觸發，金管局會應銀行要求，按每美元兌7.75港元向銀行沽出港元、買入美元（或按7.85港元買入港元、沽出美元），使總結餘增加（或減少），令港元利率下跌（或上升），從而促使港元匯率回復到7.75至7.85 的兌換範圍。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n隨着3月全球爆發新冠病毒疫情，避險情緒下環球投資者增持美元，令美元資金狀況明顯收緊。在聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）下，由於港元利率受同期美元利率影響，美元流動性緊張令香港貨幣狀況收緊。儘管其後美國聯邦儲備局實施流動資金計劃，美元資金壓力有所紓緩，但由於股票相關需求及季結效應，令香港貨幣狀況仍維持偏緊。而港元需求殷切，加上港元與美元的正息差刺激套息交易活動，促使港元匯率偏向強方兌換保證匯率（圖1），強方兌換保證最終於4月被觸發。其後新股集資活動暢旺，以及「滬港通」與「深港通」下的南向資金帶動股票相關資金流入，令港元一直維持接近7.75水平，並導致強方兌換保證在2020年內多次被觸發。強方兌換保證在4月21日至10月28日期間合共被觸發85次，累計資金流入3,835億港元。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2020年全年運作正常。\n\n圖 1 2020年市場匯率\n\n總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2019年底的11,330億港元，增加至2020年底的15,266億港元（圖2）。隨着強方兌換保證被觸發，金管局應銀行要求合共沽出3,835億港元。新冠病毒疫情引致環球宏觀環境波動，金管局為了提供額外港元流動性，亦於4月底及5月初逐步減發總計200億港元外匯基金票據。由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）由2019年底的543億港元，增加至2020年底的4,575億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由10,787億港元，稍降至10,692億港元，反映外匯基金票據發行量減少，這抵銷了按一貫做法以新發行的外匯基金票據及債券來吸納未償還外匯基金票據及債券的利息。整體貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2020年總結餘（進行貼現窗活動前）及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n隨着農曆新年假期後流動性需求減退，香港銀行同業拆息在2月普遍下降（圖3）。踏入3月，由於美元資金壓力，連同新股集資相關及季結資金需求等本地因素，香港銀行同業拆息一度上升。其後由於強方兌換保證被觸發及外匯基金票據發行量減少，令總結餘增加，港元流動性狀況逐步紓緩。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於3月兩度下調，以及反映年內隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息變動，基本利率由年初的2.73厘下降至年底收報0.50厘。在零售層面，儘管美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍調低，銀行仍維持最優惠貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2019年的383億港元降至2020年的91億港元。\n\n圖 3 2020 年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n過去30多年來，聯匯制度一直是香港金融體系的重要支柱，歷經考驗均能展現強大的抵禦衝擊的能力。儘管2020年面對挑戰，港元外匯及貨幣市場保持正常運作，一再證明聯匯制度穩健有效。年內面對一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑聯匯制度以至香港的金融穩定，金管局迅速向公眾重申香港會繼續實施聯匯制度，同時資金自由流動及港幣自由兌換受到《基本法》第112條保障。金管局另又發表多篇文章，闡明逆境下香港金融體系繼續展現強大抵禦衝擊能力的事實。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。香港的金融市場有序運作，以及港元繼續如常作為支付及保值貨幣，反映上述措施有效維持公眾對聯匯制度的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在《2020年對外部門報告》重申香港擁有具透明度的規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融規管與監管、靈活的經濟，以及審慎的財政架構，確保聯匯制度具公信力。\n\n穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用。儘管新冠病毒疫情構成負面影響，香港銀行體系繼續運作暢順，流動性及資本水平以國際標準而言均非常充裕。為確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力，金管局一直密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行貸款的監管。與此同時，金管局亦為銀行體系提供更多流動性，維持貨幣及金融穩定。除減發外匯基金票據以增加港元流動性外，金管局為銀行設立一系列流動資金安排。此外，金管局與銀行保持聯繫，確保它們在緊張情況時利用這些流動資金安排。因應新冠病毒疫情為環球金融市場帶來波動及不確定因素，金管局推出臨時性美元流動資金安排，為持牌銀行提供美元流動性支援，有助紓緩環球美元銀行拆借市場流動性緊絀的情況。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2020年在109.8至112.1%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日收報109.9%（圖4）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強而有力的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2020年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 其他事務\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察及探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2020年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港經濟的情景分析、香港物業市場的評估、了解跨境資金流的概念架構，以及了解香港銀行同業市場。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n疫情持續下，香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）在2020年仍能維持一定數量的研究成果。在2020年，研究中心合共發表20篇研究論文，涵蓋貨幣政策、銀行體系穩定、市場微觀結構和金融科技發展等廣泛議題，部份論文已獲接納或正被評審在專業期刊中刊登。在疫情下由於要實施社交距離及旅遊限制，研究中心舉辦的研討會、講座及到訪研究計劃等主要活動需要押後，待日後公共衛生和旅遊條件回復正常後，研究中心將會復辦上述活動。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2020年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值5,595億港元，較上年增加8.3%（圖5、6及7）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值127億港元，較上年減少0.6%（圖8及9）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值46億港元，其中塑質鈔票佔79%。\n\n圖 5 2020年底按發鈔銀行分析的銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 6 2020年底流通銀行紙幣分布情況\n\n圖 7 2020 年底銀行紙幣流通金額\n\n圖 8 2020年底政府發行紙幣及硬幣流通金額\n\n圖 9 2020年底政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣分析\n\n# 香港鈔票\n\n繼於2020年1月推出20港元及50港元面額新鈔，2018年新鈔系列所有5款面額鈔票已在市面流通。該系列鈔票具備更強固及應用方便的防偽特徵，廣受市民歡迎，並逐漸取代舊版鈔票。\n\n年內金管局繼續舉辦講座，介紹香港鈔票的設計及防偽特徵。金管局舉辦8場講座(包括網上形式)，增進公眾對香港鈔票的認識，吸引2,000多名人士參加，包括銀行櫃位職員、商戶及學生等。\n\n# 硬幣收集計劃\n\n硬幣收集計劃於2014年10月推出，年內繼續廣受大眾歡迎。這是全球首個有系統的流動硬幣收集計劃，設有兩部收銀車輪流停駐全港18區。每部收銀車均裝設兩部高速硬幣點算機，市民可選擇將硬幣轉換成鈔票或用作八達通卡或電子錢包等儲值支付工具增值，亦可將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。此外，金管局與香港社會服務聯會合作，在非政府組織賣旗日派出收銀車收集硬幣。收銀車亦到訪學校，增進學生對硬幣收集計劃的認識。過去多年硬幣收集計劃曾獲頒多個本港及國際獎項，對其創新及環保的處理方法予以肯定。\n","en":"# Currency stability\n\nDespite the increased uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange and money markets have operated smoothly and in an orderly manner. Supported by substantial inflows of funds related to equities, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained relatively strong for most of 2020, with the strong-side convertibility undertaking being triggered on multiple occasions. The linked exchange rate system is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s financial system and has fully demonstrated its strong ability to withstand shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, which means ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and keeping it trading within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100 percent backing for the monetary base; any changes in the monetary base must be matched by corresponding increases or decreases in the US dollar reserves, aligning with the percentage change in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Currency in circulation issued by the Government, including coins\n- The aggregate balances of clearing accounts maintained with the HKMA (i.e., the total balance)\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through the automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange guarantee. When the strong-side (or weak-side) convertibility undertaking is triggered, the HKMA will, upon request from banks, sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars at HK$7.75 per US dollar (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at HK$7.85), increasing (or decreasing) the aggregate balance, causing Hong Kong dollar interest rates to fall (or rise), thereby encouraging the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the convertibility range of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n## 2020 Retrospective\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic erupted globally in March, risk aversion led global investors to increase their holdings of US dollars, resulting in a noticeable tightening of US dollar funding conditions. Under the linked exchange rate system, as Hong Kong dollar interest rates are influenced by contemporaneous US interest rates, the tight US dollar liquidity led to a tightening of monetary conditions in Hong Kong. Although the US Federal Reserve subsequently implemented liquidity programs, which eased dollar funding pressures to some extent, continued demand related to equities and end-of-quarter effects kept Hong Kong monetary conditions relatively tight. Strong demand for Hong Kong dollars, coupled with the positive interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar stimulating carry trade activity, pushed the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the strong-side convertibility guarantee (Figure 1), which was ultimately triggered in April. Subsequently, robust initial public offering (IPO) activity and southbound inflows under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs drove capital inflows related to equities, keeping the Hong Kong dollar consistently close to 7.75 and causing the strong-side convertibility guarantee to be triggered multiple times throughout 2020. The strong-side convertibility guarantee was triggered a total of 85 times between April 21 and October 28, resulting in cumulative inflows of HK$383.5 billion. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market functioned normally throughout 2020.\n\nFigure 1: 2020 Market Exchange Rates\n\nThe aggregate balance (before conducting discount window operations) and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds increased from HK$1,133 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$1,526.6 billion at the end of 2020 (Figure 2). Following the triggering of the strong-side conversion undertaking, the HKMA sold a total of HK$383.5 billion on behalf of banks.  Due to the volatility in the global macroeconomic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA also gradually reduced the issuance of Exchange Fund bills by a total of HK$20 billion in late April and early May to provide additional Hong Kong dollar liquidity. As a result of the triggering of the strong-side conversion undertaking and the decrease in the amount of Exchange Fund bills issued, the aggregate balance (before conducting discount window operations) increased from HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019 to HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds decreased slightly from HK$1,078.7 billion during the year to HK$1,069.2 billion, reflecting the decrease in the amount of Exchange Fund bills issued, which offset the interest paid on outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds by consistently absorbing them with newly issued Exchange Fund bills and bonds. The overall monetary base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: 2020 Cumulative Surplus (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Money Market\n\nFollowing the easing of liquidity demand after the Lunar New Year holiday, the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) generally decreased in February (Figure 3). Entering March, HIBOR rose temporarily due to pressure on US dollar funding, coupled with local factors such as initial public offering (IPO) fundraising and end-of-quarter funding needs. Subsequently, the triggering of the strong-side convertibility undertaking and a decrease in the issuance of Exchange Fund bills led to an increase in aggregate balance, gradually easing Hong Kong’s liquidity conditions.\n\nIn response to two cuts in the US federal funds rate target range in March, and reflecting changes in the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates throughout the year, the base rate decreased from 2.73% at the beginning of the year to 0.50% at year-end. At the retail level, despite the lowering of the US federal funds rate target range, banks maintained their prime lending rates unchanged. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to function normally. Discount window lending decreased from HK$38.3 billion in 2019 to HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (HIBOR) in 2020\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nFor over 30 years, the Linked Exchange Rate System has been a vital pillar of Hong Kong’s financial system, consistently demonstrating a strong ability to withstand shocks. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and monetary market continued to operate normally, repeatedly proving the Linked Exchange Rate System to be stable and effective. Throughout the year, in response to unfounded rumors questioning the Linked Exchange Rate System and Hong Kong’s financial stability, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) swiftly reaffirmed to the public that Hong Kong would continue to implement the Linked Exchange Rate System, while the free flow of capital and the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar are protected under Article 112 of the Basic Law. The HKMA also published numerous articles clarifying the fact that Hong Kong’s financial system continues to demonstrate a strong ability to withstand shocks even in adverse circumstances. The Government also firmly maintained the Linked Exchange Rate System. The orderly operation of Hong Kong’s financial markets, and the continued use of the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and store of value, reflect the effectiveness of these measures in maintaining public confidence in the Linked Exchange Rate System. In its “2020 External Sector Report,” the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, robust financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the smooth functioning of the linked exchange rate system. Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking system in Hong Kong has continued to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital levels remaining very ample by international standards. To ensure the banking system’s resilience, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintaining regulation of bank lending. At the same time, the HKMA has also provided additional liquidity to the banking system to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition to reducing the issuance of Exchange Fund bills to increase Hong Kong dollar liquidity, the HKMA has established a series of liquidity facilities for banks. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close communication with banks to ensure they utilize these liquidity facilities during times of stress. In response to the volatility and uncertainty brought to global financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA launched temporary US dollar liquidity facilities to provide US dollar liquidity support to licensed banks, helping to alleviate tight US dollar funding conditions in the global interbank market.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to back the monetary base since October 1998. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.8% and 112.1% in 2020, without reaching either the upper or lower limit. The ratio closed at 109.9% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, while certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the backing portfolio, the entire assets of the Exchange Fund are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources, coupled with Hong Kong’s sound banking system, provide a strong backing for maintaining monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily Fluctuation of Support Rate in 2020\n\n# Other matters.\n\nThe Currency Issuance Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for monitoring and examining issues relating to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. In 2020, the issues examined by the Currency Issuance Committee included a scenario analysis of the Hong Kong economy, an assessment of the Hong Kong property market, understanding the conceptual framework of cross-border capital flows, and understanding the Hong Kong interbank market. The minutes of the Currency Issuance Committee meetings and the reports on the operation of the monetary authority system submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Research\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (the Institute) was able to maintain a certain volume of research output in 2020. In that year, the Institute collectively published 20 research papers covering a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking system stability, market microstructure, and the development of financial technology, with some papers having been accepted for publication or are currently under review by professional journals. Due to social distancing and travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic, the Institute’s major activities such as seminars, lectures, and visiting research schemes had to be postponed. These activities will be resumed when public health and travel conditions return to normal.\n\n# Paper money and coins\n\nAs of the end of 2020, the total value of banknotes in circulation issued by commercial banks was HK$559.5 billion, an increase of 8.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 5, 6 and 7). The total value of banknotes and coins issued by the Government was HK$12.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the previous year (Figures 8 and 9). Among the banknotes and coins issued by the Government, the total value of HK$10 banknotes in circulation was HK$4.6 billion, of which polymer banknotes accounted for 79%.\n\nFigure 5: Banknote Circulation by Issuing Bank as of the End of 2020\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of Circulating Banknotes as of the End of 2020\n\nFigure 7: Amount of Banknotes in Circulation at the End of 2020\n\nFigure 8: Amount of Paper Money and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government at the End of 2020.\n\nFigure 9: Analysis of Paper Money and Coins in Circulation Issued by the Government at the End of 2020.\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes.\n\nFollowing the launch of new $20 and $50 banknotes in January 2020, all five denominations of the 2018 series banknotes are now in circulation. These banknotes feature enhanced and user-friendly security features, have been well-received by the public, and are gradually replacing older versions.\n\nThroughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continued to host seminars introducing the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes. The HKMA held eight seminars (including online sessions) to enhance public understanding of Hong Kong currency, attracting over 2,000 participants, including bank tellers, merchants, and students.\n\n# Coin Collection Program\n\nThe coin collection scheme was launched in October 2014 and continued to be widely popular with the public throughout the year. It is the world’s first systematic loose change collection scheme, featuring two cash collection vehicles rotating through all 18 districts of Hong Kong. Each vehicle is equipped with two high-speed coin counters, allowing the public to exchange their coins for banknotes or to top up stored-value payment tools such as Octopus cards or e-wallets. They can also donate the funds to the Community Chest via donation boxes inside the vehicles. Furthermore, the HKMA collaborated with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the cash collection vehicles to collect coins during NGO flag days. The vehicles also visited schools to raise student awareness of the coin collection scheme. Over the years, the scheme has received numerous local and international awards, recognizing its innovative and environmentally friendly approach.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管新冠病毒疫情爆發為經濟帶來重大挑戰，香港銀行體系於2020年維持穩健。年內金管局除密切留意疫情對銀行營運及監管活動的影響並靈活應變外，繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的信用及流動性風險管理上。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業使用金融科技的上升趨勢，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及運作穩健性的監管。金管局亦與銀行及國際組織緊密合作，促進業界過渡至備用參考利率。\n\n在操守監管方面，金管局給予認可機構在遵守監管規定上彈性處理的空間以及提供指引，以便一方面協助銀行在疫情下的業務運作及繼續為客戶提供服務，另一方面則繼續確保投資者及消費者得到保障。金管局聯同有關當局制定「跨境理財通」業務試點的建議實施細則，並諮詢業界。金管局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會合作，就精簡有關家族辦公室及擁有高資產淨值並精於財務事宜的投資者的銷售程序提供指引。此外，金管局加強對數碼金融服務消費者的保障，並繼續推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面，金管局迅速採取行動，不但釐清風險為本方法及科技如何協助認可機構更有效應對與新冠病毒疫情相關的情況，並同時審慎應對持續升溫的地緣政治緊張局勢對銀行體系造成的影響。金管局繼續支持有關提升打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集工作的成效與效率的措施，包括增加參與公私營夥伴共享訊息的認可機構數目，以及支持銀行業採用合規科技。金管局又順應科技及數據運用的國際發展趨勢，展開進一步加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監察能力的計劃。\n\n與此同時，金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策與程序，以及推行提升人才專業能力的措施。香港在實施國際監管標準方面取得理想進展，包括資本充足標準和披露標準。在促進綠色及可持續銀行業的發展方面，金管局已進入三個階段中的第二階段，正制定相關監管規定。金管局亦繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，包括制定新處置標準及實施吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、應對危機及自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，必須制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2020年共進行186次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行30次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行30次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估屬較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行610次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查及評估的主要重點之一。另一個重點是在新冠病毒疫情下的業務操作風險及科技風險管理。此外，金管局又增加針對流動性及市場風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。同時，專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n儘管面對疫情，金管局維持監管力度，並作出彈性安排，靈活有效地履行監管職責，包括在提交申報表及進行現場審查方面給予彈性處理的空間；加強數據收集以補足現場審查，以及利用網上會議平台。\n\n表1載有金管局於2020年的監管工作概要。\n\n表 1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2020年貸款總額增加1.2%，2019年的增幅為6.7%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n於2020年，內地相關貸款總額略為減少0.2%至45,530億港元（表3）。\n\n表 3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n受到新冠病毒疫情影響，認可機構的資產質素略為轉差。年內銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.57%上升至0.90%，仍維持在穩健水平，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。內地相關貸款方面，相關比率亦由一年前的0.75%上升至0.96%。\n\n鑑於與新冠病毒疫情相關的不明朗因素為經濟帶來重大挑戰，金管局深入檢視認可機構資產質素，以評估資產質素轉差的趨勢。尤其金管局透過收集有關銀行在行業及借款人層面的信用風險承擔數據，加強對大額借款人及在目前的經濟環境下較易受影響行業的監察。金管局進行的特別壓力測試分析顯示，銀行有能力抵禦新冠病毒疫情帶來的經濟壓力。\n\n年內金管局進行專題評估，檢視認可機構對內地相關貸款、同業貸款，以及對私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款等不同範疇的信用風險管理方法。\n\n# 紓緩客戶資金周轉壓力的措施\n\n因應新冠病毒疫情爆發，金管局於2019年10月成立的銀行業中小企貸款協調機制（協調機制）推出多輪協助企業及個人客戶的紓緩措施，鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則容許下繼續支持借款人的融資需要。其中最主要的是協調機制於5月推出的「預先批核還息不還本」計劃。計劃下合資格的企業客戶的所有貸款本金還款可延期6個月。該計劃在11月延長6個月後，在2021年3月再度延長6個月至10月底。該計劃約有100間銀行參與，覆蓋12萬合資格企業客戶。截至12月底，銀行共批出58,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過7,400億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦推出住宅按揭「還息不還本」計劃，「居者有其屋計劃」下資助房屋的相關按揭亦涵蓋在內。此外，銀行亦提供應急貸款予從事受疫情嚴重打擊行業的客戶、延長個人貸款期限，以及下調各種個人信貸的收費。截至12月底，銀行共批出28,000多宗住宅按揭「還息不還本」及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過440億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系應對本港樓市一旦突然逆轉的抵禦能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2020年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。2020年新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數有所上升，主要由於當中涉及按揭保險的貸款的佔比有所增加，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率亦維持在低水平，於12月為37%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n考慮到非住宅物業的價格走勢與交投量、經濟基調及外圍環境等因素，金管局在8月放寬非住宅物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將這類貸款的適用按揭成數上限上調10個百分點，一般個案的上限由四成上調至五成。\n\n圖 1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n因應2020年初爆發新冠病毒疫情，金管局採取連串措施減低疫情對銀行業務運作的影響。有關措施包括要求認可機構檢討其持續業務運作計劃，並採取適當的預防措施，以保障員工與客戶的健康，以及維持重要銀行服務。此外，金管局提醒認可機構加強與員工及客戶的溝通，就其處所可能出現確診個案的情況作好準備，以及制定應對較為嚴峻但可能發生的風險情境的持續業務運作計劃。金管局與業界保持緊密聯繫，又要求認可機構保持警覺，並因應疫情的最新發展及政府的社交距離措施，不時審視其持續業務運作計劃。\n\n金管局完成對「網絡防衛計劃」的全面檢討及廣泛的業界諮詢後，於11月推出「網絡防衛計劃2.0」，因應海外網絡風險管理的最新做法，進一步提升「網絡防衛計劃」。當中「網絡防衛評估框架」加入了有關網絡事故應對及恢復的最新國際穩健做法。「網絡防衛計劃」下的「專業培訓計劃」方面，資歷認證清單的範圍有所擴大，納入主要海外地區的同等資歷。金管局又向香港銀行公會（銀行公會）提出多項建議，令「網絡風險資訊共享平台」更易於使用。「網絡防衛計劃2.0」於2021年1月1日生效。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n經過在「金融科技監管沙盒」進行嚴謹的測試與試行後，所有在2019年獲發銀行牌照的8間虛擬銀行都已經於年內開業。虛擬銀行運用創新科技，提供全新的客戶體驗，例如利用大數據分析進行中小企貸款的信貸評估，以加快貸款批核程序。為加強客戶參與及建立客戶對品牌的忠誠，部分虛擬銀行更在其定期存款及獎賞計劃等服務中加入遊戲元素。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n金管局在4月推出一系列措施，確保銀行同業市場及銀行體系在疫情下繼續暢順運作。這些措施包括釐清「金管局流動資金安排」的操作細則及推出臨時美元流動資金安排，並重申在監管架構下認可機構可使用流動性緩衝的彈性。金管局又與認可機構進行演習，確保認可機構已經作好準備，能夠在有需要時運用這些措施。\n","en":"# Banking system stable.\n\nDespite the significant challenges the COVID-19 pandemic posed to the economy, the banking system in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2020. Throughout the year, the HKMA closely monitored the impact of the pandemic on banking operations and regulatory activities, responding with flexibility, while continuing to prioritize credit and liquidity risk management at authorized institutions. Given the increasing cyber threats and the rising trend of financial technology adoption in the banking sector, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of technology risk management and operational resilience at authorized institutions. The HKMA also worked closely with banks and international organizations to facilitate the industry’s transition to alternative reference rates.\n\nRegarding prudential supervision, the HKMA has given authorized institutions flexibility in complying with regulatory requirements and provided guidance to help banks continue their operations and serve customers during the pandemic, while also continuing to ensure the protection of investors and consumers. The HKMA, together with relevant authorities, has developed proposed implementation details for the pilot scheme for the Wealth Management Connect and consulted the industry. The HKMA has collaborated with the Securities and Futures Commission to provide guidance on streamlining the sales processes for family offices and sophisticated investors with high net worth. In addition, the HKMA has strengthened consumer protection for digital financial services and continues to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has taken swift action to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, clarifying how a risk-based approach and technology can help regulated institutions more effectively address situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also prudently managing the impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on the banking system. The HKMA continues to support measures to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts, including increasing the number of regulated institutions participating in public-private information sharing partnerships and supporting the banking sector’s adoption of RegTech. In line with international trends in technology and data utilization, the HKMA is also launching initiatives to further strengthen its supervisory capabilities in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is working closely with the banking industry to refine regulatory policies and procedures, and to implement measures to enhance the professional capabilities of talent. Hong Kong has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, including those for capital adequacy and disclosure. Regarding the promotion of green and sustainable banking, the HKMA has entered the second of three phases and is developing relevant regulatory provisions. The HKMA also continues to be committed to ensuring that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules for total loss-absorbing capacity, to enhance the resolvability of these institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal crucially depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing essential financial services for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the banking system through their operational methods, or even through disorderly failure in extreme circumstances. As the regulator, the Financial Secretary plays a vital role in safeguarding financial stability, ensuring banks are able to withstand shocks, respond to crises and recover from them, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Financial Secretary is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted license banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as “authorized institutions”). The Financial Secretary is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the Financial Secretary cannot guarantee a risk-free financial system, nor is Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Financial Secretary strives to ensure that, should a recognized institution become non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution regime, and the Financial Secretary acts as the resolution authority for recognized institutions (and other types of institutions) under that regime. Implementing Hong Kong’s resolution regime requires developing resolution rules and policy standards, conducting resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of recognized institutions, and building the HKMA’s operational capabilities to resolve failing recognized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the HKMA adopts approaches that are consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\n## 2020 Retrospective\n\n# Regulatory Oversight Overview\n\nIn 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 186 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including CAMEL assessments of authorized institutions, corporate governance, risk management, and financial technology strategies. To further strengthen the risk governance levels of authorized institutions, the HKMA held 30 meetings with the boards of directors of authorized institutions, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards. It also held 30 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site reviews, the HKMA also conducts regular on-site inspections, supplemented by targeted assessments to examine areas identified as higher risk for the institutions being assessed. Throughout the year, the HKMA conducted a total of 610 on-site inspections and targeted assessments, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management. Another key area of focus was operational risk and technology risk management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the HKMA increased the number of on-site inspections and targeted assessments relating to liquidity and market risk management. Simultaneously, specialized review teams conducted on-site inspections and targeted assessments of authorized institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) related business.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintained its regulatory intensity and made flexible arrangements, fulfilling its supervisory responsibilities effectively and adaptably. This included providing flexibility in submitting reports and conducting on-site inspections, enhancing data collection to supplement on-site reviews, and utilizing online conferencing platforms.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory work in 2020.\n\nTable 1: Overview of Regulatory Work\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality.\n\nTotal loan volume increased by 1.2% in 2020, compared to a growth rate of 6.7% in 2019. Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans and advances.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nIn 2020, the total amount of related loans from the Mainland slightly decreased by 0.2% to HK$455.3 billion (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n\nThe asset quality of accredited institutions has slightly deteriorated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ratio of special mention loans in the banking sector rose from 0.57% to 0.90% during the year, remaining at a healthy level and significantly below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000. Regarding loans related to mainland China, the corresponding ratio also increased from 0.75% a year ago to 0.96%.\n\nGiven the significant challenges to the economy stemming from uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has thoroughly reviewed the asset quality of authorized institutions to assess the trend of deteriorating asset quality. In particular, the HKMA has enhanced its monitoring of large borrowers and sectors more vulnerable to the current economic environment by collecting data on credit risk exposures at both the industry and borrower levels for banks. The HKMA’s special stress testing analysis indicates that banks are capable of withstanding the economic pressures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct a thematic review this year to examine the credit risk management approaches of authorized institutions across different areas, including loans related to the Mainland, interbank loans, and mortgage loans to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\n# Measures to alleviate customer financial pressure.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a bank-industry SME Loan Coordination Mechanism (the Mechanism) in October 2019. The Mechanism rolled out multiple rounds of relief measures to support corporate and individual customers, encouraging banks to continue supporting borrowers’ financing needs within the principles of prudent risk management. The most prominent of these was the “Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday” scheme launched by the Mechanism in May. Under the scheme, eligible corporate customers were able to defer principal payments on all their loans for six months. The scheme was extended for another six months in November, and again in March 2021 for a further six months to the end of October. Approximately 100 banks participated in the scheme, covering 120,000 eligible corporate customers. As of the end of December, banks had approved over 58,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures for corporate customers, involving a total amount exceeding HK$740 billion. For individual customers, banks also launched a mortgage “interest-only repayment” scheme, which included mortgages under the Home Ownership Scheme. In addition, banks offered emergency loans to customers in severely affected industries, extended personal loan tenors, and reduced fees for various personal credit products. As of the end of December, banks had approved over 28,000 cases of mortgage “interest-only repayment” and other personal emergency loans, involving a total amount exceeding HK$44 billion.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have strengthened risk management by banks and the resilience of the banking system in Hong Kong to a sudden reversal in the property market. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans was 57% in December 2020, compared to 64% before the introduction of the first round of countercyclical measures in September 2009. The average LTV ratio for newly approved residential mortgage loans increased in 2020, mainly due to a higher proportion of loans covered by mortgage insurance, which generally have higher LTV ratios. The average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio for new mortgages also remained at a low level, at 37% in December, compared to 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nConsidering the price trends and transaction volumes of non-residential properties, as well as the economic climate and external environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority relaxed its countercyclical macroprudential measures on non-residential property mortgage loans in August, raising the applicable loan-to-value ratio cap by 10 percentage points. The cap for general cases was increased from 40% to 50%.\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for Newly Approved Residential Mortgage Loans\n\n# Operational and Technological Risk Oversight\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) implemented a series of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on banking operations. These measures included requiring authorized institutions to review their business continuity plans and take appropriate preventative measures to protect the health of their employees and customers, as well as to maintain essential banking services. In addition, the HKMA reminded authorized institutions to strengthen communication with their employees and customers, prepare for potential confirmed cases at their premises, and develop business continuity plans to address more severe, yet possible, risk scenarios. The HKMA maintained close contact with the industry and requested authorized institutions to remain vigilant and regularly review their business continuity plans in light of the latest developments of the pandemic and the government’s social distancing measures.\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review and extensive industry consultation on the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework,” the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0” in November, further enhancing the framework in line with the latest international practices in overseas cyber risk management. The “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework” incorporates the latest international robust practices regarding cyber incident response and recovery. Regarding the “Professional Training Scheme” under the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework,” the scope of the qualification accreditation list has been expanded to include equivalent qualifications from major overseas regions. The HKMA has also made several recommendations to the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to make the “Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform” more user-friendly. “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0” took effect on January 1, 2021.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nFollowing rigorous testing and trials within the “FinTech Regulatory Sandbox,” all eight virtual banks licensed in 2019 have launched operations this year. These virtual banks leverage innovative technologies to provide a novel customer experience, such as utilizing big data analytics for credit assessment of SME loans to expedite the loan approval process. To enhance customer engagement and build brand loyalty, some virtual banks have also incorporated gamification elements into their services, including fixed deposit accounts and reward programs.\n\n# Regulation of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nIn April, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) introduced a series of measures to ensure the continued smooth functioning of the interbank market and the banking system during the epidemic. These measures included clarifying the operational details of the “HKMA Liquidity Facility” and launching a temporary US dollar liquidity facility, as well as reaffirming the flexibility for authorized institutions to utilize liquidity buffers under the regulatory framework. The HKMA also conducted exercises with authorized institutions to ensure they were prepared to deploy these measures when necessary.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n香港繼續是具全球競爭力的國際金融中心。年內金管局採取多項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技。在新冠病毒疫情下年內快速支付系統「轉數快」交易量急增。\n\n香港位處內地金融市場對外開放的要衝，能充分把握開放過程中的契機。憑藉世界級的市場基建以及「滬港通」、「深港通」與「債券通」，香港既是深受內地企業垂青的集資平台，亦是國際投資者進入增長迅速的內地市場的窗口。年內在促進粵港澳大灣區金融合作，尤其便利香港居民在大灣區內使用金融及銀行服務方面取得良好進展。\n\n與此同時，金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台，包括資產及財富管理、企業財資中心，以及可持續金融範疇的競爭力。金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。在環球層面，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色，充分凸顯香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為鞏固香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位，金管局繼續致力實施各項措施，促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用科技。年內的主要進展包括：\n- 推動更廣泛使用快速支付系統「轉數快」；\n- 促進銀行業實施開放應用程式介面（開放API）；\n- 連接貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台，促進貿易融資數碼化；\n- 研究央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用；\n- 探討「商業數據通」的技術可行性及研究新類型信貸評分模型，以助中小型企業（中小企）獲取融資；\n- 公布旨在發展更具規模及更多元的合規科技生態圈的兩年計劃，進一步推動合規科技的應用；\n- 加強培育人才；及\n- 推進跨境金融科技合作。\n\n金管局金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)與金管局各銀行部門聯手，在推動上述措施中發揮關鍵作用。\n\n隨着主要金融市場指數開始加入內地在岸證券或增加其權重，流入人民幣資產的資金繼續加快步伐。香港得天獨厚，憑藉連繫內地資本市場的「滬港通」、「深港通」及「債券通」，在促進國際投資者增加人民幣資產配置方面發揮關鍵的作用。在2020年，「債券通」平均每日交易額增加82%，至約193億元人民幣。為完善「債券通」運作，金管局推出新措施，包括新設特別結算周期服務、延長交易時間及引入新安排，讓投資者在選擇銀行進行貨幣兌換與外幣對沖方面有較多彈性。繼「債券通」北向通取得成功，金管局又與人民銀行組成工作小組研究南向通的框架。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力加強香港與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市之間的金融配套措施。內地當局公布一系列政策措施，支持區內金融發展。於6月，人民銀行、金管局與澳門金融管理局（澳門金管局）聯合宣布決定實施跨境「理財通」。金管局一直與內地和本地當局以及業界緊密合作，制定有關實施細則。金管局亦就其他措施與內地當局保持聯繫，尋求為香港銀行擴大政策空間拓展更廣闊的跨境業務範疇。年內，香港繼續保持作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。香港的人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額創出1.2萬億元人民幣的新高。\n\n金管局積極開拓新機遇，提升香港金融平台競爭力。為促進香港基金業務的發展，金管局與政府及業界緊密合作，為基金在本地落戶締造更有利的稅務及監管環境。金管局亦投入大量工作，繼續提升香港作為區內綠色及可持續金融樞紐的地位。與此同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推廣香港的金融服務。\n\n在中央銀行領域，金管局在多個區內及國際委員會擔當領導角色。例如，金管局為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下政策及標準小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP)轄下金融市場工作小組主席。金管局亦擔任金融穩定理事會轄下非銀行監察專家小組及金融創新網絡聯席主席，並領導探討基準過渡相關監管事項的小組。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港的國際金融中心地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2020年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快使用量在2020年繼續增長。截至2020年底合共錄得690萬個登記，全年交易量較2019年上升兩倍。政府接受以轉數快繳費及更多商戶採用，是轉數快在個人對個人支付穩步增長以外，交易額錄得顯著增長的主要原因。\n\n為確保本地零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定及監察6個零售支付系統。金管局亦繼續監管18個儲值支付工具持牌人。\n\n# 2020年回顧\n\n# 香港的亞洲金融科技樞紐地位\n\n# 轉數快\n\n自2018年9月轉數快推出以來，已有35間銀行及12間儲值支付工具營運商加入，其中在2020年增加了5間銀行及1間儲值支付工具營運商。轉數快使用量亦穩步增長。截至12月31日，轉數快共錄得690萬個登記（圖1）。為方便市民收取由機構發出的款項，轉數快於12月6日起新增以香港身份證號碼作帳戶識別代號。引入這項功能後不足1個月已錄得超過110,000個登記。這項新功能並非用於個人對個人轉帳，只供已有收款人身份證號碼的機構發放款項（例如發放薪酬）之用。由於每名市民的身份證號碼都是獨一無二，市民利用香港身份證號碼作為帳戶識別代號，即使不提供銀行帳戶號碼都能夠確保準確收取款項。\n\n圖 1 轉數快帳戶登記數目\n\n新冠病毒疫情及保持社交距離措施為使用電子支付服務帶來新動力。年內轉數快交易量增長尤其迅速（圖2），於2020年12月的平均每日交易量達505,000宗即時交易（涉及52億港元及9,500萬元人民幣），相當於2019年12月168,000宗的3倍，更是2018年10月轉數快推出首月的10倍。轉數快使用量增加，亦受惠於應用範圍逐步擴大，由最初主要用作個人對個人支付，逐步擴展至繳付帳單（包括政府帳單）、零售及商業支付。\n\n圖 2 港元即時支付平均每日交易數字\n\n金管局與多個政府部門及銀行業一直合作，將轉數快的應用範圍由個人對個人支付，擴展至繳付帳單及其他商戶支付。政府於2019年11月起接受以轉數快繳付帳單，以推廣使用轉數快及便利市民。市民以支援轉數快的手機銀行或電子錢包掃描印於帳單上的二維碼，即可輕鬆繳付稅款、差餉及地租、水費及政府發出的一般繳費單。截至2020年12月經轉數快繳付政府帳單的交易達180萬宗，涉及22億港元。繼繳付政府帳單服務成功推出後，再有4個政府部門由2020年12月21日起接受在指定繳費櫃枱及自助服務機以轉數快二維碼繳費。政府亦正在探討於網上採用轉數快付款的安排。\n\n另一正面的發展是越來越多大小商戶採用轉數快以加強業務營運。支付商戶的交易在2020年12月急增至平均每日100,000宗，較2019年12月增加38倍轉數快普遍用作繳付帳單、應用程式內直接扣帳，以及進行其他網上購物。電子錢包日益普及，亦帶動了以轉數快為帳戶增值的交易量顯著增長。2020年12月平均每日增值的交易量，是2019年12月的7倍。\n\n為加強市民對轉數快的認識，金管局製作各類教育及宣傳資料，包括電視廣告及在社交媒體平台提供一系列精明使用錦囊。金管局亦舉辦中學生Whatsapp Stickers設計比賽，增加他們對電子支付的認識。此外，金管局向多個慈善團體及街市營運商推廣使用轉數快收付款項。多間參與轉數快的銀行及儲值支付工具營運商亦推出宣傳活動，包括提供優惠，吸引客戶登記及利用轉數快轉帳及支付帳單。在2020年的成果上，金管局在2021年初與銀行及儲值支付工具營運商合作，推廣透過轉數快以電子方式派利是。一方面金管局推出宣傳活動，另一方面銀行及儲值支付工具營運商則提供優惠，鼓勵客戶以電子方式派利是，既環保又有助抗疫。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n金管局繼續促進銀行業按照開放API框架研發及提供開放API。該框架分4個階段實施，銀行已推出第一及第二階段開放API，並以這些開放API與第三方服務提供者合作，開拓各項創新服務，提升客戶體驗。另一方面，金管局就實施第三及第四階段開放API進行調查研究，並於11月刊發小冊子，刊載調查結果。\n\n# 貿易聯動\n\n為使進出口商獲得更方便的貿易融資服務，金管局於年內展開概念驗證研究，探討連接「貿易聯動」與人民銀行轄下的貿易金融區塊鏈平台。該研究的首階段於年內第4季完成，並隨後開始試行。香港和內地銀行已用該連接成功完成多項跨境貿易融資交易。\n\n# 跨境支付\n\n央行數碼貨幣方面，金管局與泰國中央銀行繼續進行聯合研究，探討央行數碼貨幣於跨境支付的應用藉此促進香港與泰國兩地銀行之間港元和泰銖的外匯交易同步交收。雙方完成第一階段研究，並於1月發表聯合報告闡述主要研究結果；另亦開發以區塊鏈為基礎的跨境走廊網絡原型，致力提高跨境支付的效率及降低成本。項目第二階段已展開，旨在探討跨境貿易結算及資本市場交易的商業應用案例。其他央行亦對項目深感興趣。國際結算銀行、阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和人民銀行數字貨幣研究所於2021年初宣布參與項目。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nHong Kong continues to be a globally competitive international financial center. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority took multiple measures to promote the development and application of financial technology in the banking and payment industries. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, transaction volume for the Faster Payment System, “FPS,” surged rapidly this year.\n\nHong Kong is strategically located at the forefront of China’s financial market opening-up, allowing it to fully capitalize on the opportunities arising from this process. With world-class market infrastructure and schemes like Stock Connect (Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong) and Bond Connect, Hong Kong is both a preferred fundraising platform for Mainland enterprises and a gateway for international investors to access the rapidly growing Mainland market. Significant progress has been made this year in promoting financial cooperation within the Greater Bay Area, particularly in facilitating Hong Kong residents’ access to financial and banking services within the region.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is actively exploring new opportunities and enhancing Hong Kong’s financial platform, including its competitiveness in asset and wealth management, corporate finance, and sustainable finance. The HKMA is also strengthening market promotion, showcasing Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders both overseas and in Mainland China. On the global stage, the HKMA plays a leading role in various regional and international committees, fully demonstrating Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment in related international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s position as a leading Asian financial technology hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to actively implement various measures to promote the development and application of technology within the banking and payments industries. Key progress made this year includes:\n- Promoting wider adoption of the Faster Payment System “Faster Payments System”;\n- Facilitating the implementation of Open Application Programming Interfaces (Open APIs) in the banking sector;\n- Connecting the Trade Finance Platform “e-Trade Connect” with the trade finance blockchain platform under the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), to promote the digitalization of trade finance;\n- Researching the application of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in cross-border payments;\n- Exploring the technical feasibility of “Commercial Data Exchange” and researching new credit scoring models to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access financing;\n- Announcing a two-year plan to develop a larger and more diverse RegTech ecosystem, further promoting the application of RegTech;\n- Strengthening talent cultivation; and\n- Advancing cross-border FinTech collaboration.\n\nThe Financial Technology Promotion Office (FFO) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, working in conjunction with various departments within the HKMA, played a key role in promoting the aforementioned measures.\n\nAs major financial market indices begin to include mainland China’s onshore securities or increase their weighting, the inflow of funds into RMB-denominated assets continues to accelerate. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to play a key role in facilitating increased allocation to RMB assets by international investors, thanks to its connectivity to mainland China’s capital markets through schemes such as Stock Connect (Shanghai-Hong Kong), Stock Connect (Shenzhen-Hong Kong), and Bond Connect. In 2020, the average daily turnover of Bond Connect increased by 82% to approximately RMB 19.3 billion. To refine the operation of Bond Connect, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched new measures, including the introduction of a new special settlement cycle service, extended trading hours, and new arrangements to provide investors with greater flexibility in choosing banks for currency exchange and foreign exchange hedging. Following the success of the Northbound Bond Connect, the HKMA has again formed a working group with the People’s Bank of China to study the framework for Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to enhance financial facilitation measures between Hong Kong and Mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA). Mainland authorities have announced a series of policy measures to support financial development within the region. In June, the People’s Bank of China, the HKMA, and the Monetary Authority of Macao jointly announced a decision to implement the Cross-Boundary Wealth Management Connect. The HKMA has been working closely with Mainland and local authorities, as well as industry participants, to formulate the detailed implementation rules. The HKMA is also maintaining communication with Mainland authorities regarding other measures, seeking to expand the policy space for Hong Kong banks to broaden the scope of their cross-border business. Throughout the year, Hong Kong has continued to maintain its position as a global offshore RMB business hub. The average daily transaction volume of Hong Kong’s RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a new high of RMB 1.2 trillion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively exploring new opportunities and enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund industry in Hong Kong, the HKMA is working closely with the Government and industry stakeholders to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment for funds to establish a presence locally. The HKMA is also dedicating significant effort to further strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. At the same time, the HKMA is intensifying its marketing efforts to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to stakeholders both overseas and in Mainland China.\n\nIn the realm of central banking, the HKMA plays a leading role in various areas and on international committees. For example, the HKMA chairs the Policy and Standards Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), as well as the Financial Market Workstream under the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA also serves as a joint chair of the Non-bank Financial Intermediation Supervision Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and leads a group exploring regulatory matters related to benchmark transitions.\n\nThe safe and effective operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure underpins its status as an international financial center. The four Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Money Markets Unit (CMU) system, and the Hong Kong Securities Clearing and Settlement System (Hong Kong Securities Depository) all achieved 100% system availability in 2020, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts maintained with two central securities depositories on the Mainland, the CMU system continued to facilitate the settlement of northbound trading under the Bond Connect scheme, as well as holding Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU system members.\n\nThe number of registered users for Faster Payments System (FPS) continued to grow in 2020. A total of 6.9 million registrations were recorded by the end of 2020, with transaction volume more than doubling compared to 2019. Government acceptance of FPS for fee payments and increased adoption by merchants were key reasons for the significant growth in transaction value, in addition to the steady growth of person-to-person payments.\n\nTo ensure the overall safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designates and supervises six retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”). The HKMA also continues to regulate 18 licensed stored value facility operators.\n\n## 2020 Retrospective\n\n# Hong Kong's position as an Asian FinTech hub.\n\n# Quick-witted.\n\nSince its launch in September 2018, 35 banks and 12 stored value facility operators have joined Faster Payment System (FPS). In 2020 alone, 5 banks and 1 stored value facility operator were added. FPS usage has also been steadily increasing. As of December 31st, a total of 6.9 million registrations had been recorded (Figure 1). To facilitate the public in receiving funds from organizations, FPS added the use of Hong Kong Identity Card numbers as account identifiers starting December 6th. Within less than a month of introducing this function, over 110,000 registrations were recorded. This new function is not for person-to-person transfers; it is solely for organizations to disburse funds to recipients whose identity card numbers are already known (e.g., salary payments). As each citizen’s identity card number is unique, using it as an account identifier ensures accurate receipt of funds even without providing a bank account number.\n\nFigure 1: Number of Fast Transfer Account Registrations\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have provided new impetus for the use of electronic payment services. The volume of FPS (Faster Payment System) transactions grew particularly rapidly within the year (Figure 2), reaching an average of 505,000 daily transactions in December 2020 (involving HK$5.2 billion and RMB 95 million), three times the 168,000 transactions in December 2019, and ten times the figure for the first month of FPS launch in October 2018. The increased usage of FPS has also benefited from the gradual expansion of its applications, from initially being used mainly for person-to-person payments to progressively including bill payments (including government bills), retail and commercial payments.\n\nFigure 2: Average Daily Transaction Numbers for Hong Kong Dollar Instant Payments\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been collaborating with various government departments and the banking sector to expand the application of Faster Payment System (FPS) from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. The government began accepting FPS for bill payments in November 2019 to promote the use of FPS and provide convenience to the public. Citizens can easily pay taxes, rates and government rent, water charges, and general government demand notes by scanning the QR codes printed on the bills using their FPS-enabled mobile banking apps or e-wallets. As of December 2020, there were 1.8 million transactions for government bill payments made via FPS, involving HK$2.2 billion. Following the successful launch of the government bill payment service, four more government departments began accepting FPS QR code payments at designated counter services and self-service kiosks from December 21, 2020. The government is also exploring arrangements for adopting FPS for online payments.\n\nAnother positive development is the increasing adoption of Faster Payment System (FPS) by businesses of all sizes to enhance their operations. Transactions at merchant payment points surged to an average of 100,000 per day in December 2020, a 38-fold increase compared to December 2019. FPS is commonly used for bill payments, direct debit within applications, and other online shopping. The growing popularity of e-wallets has also driven a significant increase in transactions for topping up accounts via FPS. The average daily top-up transaction volume in December 2020 was seven times that of December 2019.\n\nTo enhance public understanding of Faster Payment System (FPS), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has produced a variety of educational and promotional materials, including television advertisements and a series of tips on using FPS wisely via social media platforms. The HKMA also organized a WhatsApp sticker design competition for secondary school students to increase their awareness of electronic payments. In addition, the HKMA has promoted the use of FPS for receiving payments to various charitable organizations and wet market operators. Many banks and stored value facility operators participating in FPS have also launched promotional campaigns, including offering incentives, to attract customers to register and use FPS for fund transfers and bill payments. Building on the success in 2020, the HKMA collaborated with banks and stored value facility operators in early 2021 to promote the electronic distribution of \"lai see\" (red packets) via FPS. While the HKMA launched promotional activities, banks and stored value facility operators offered incentives to encourage customers to distribute \"lai see\" electronically, which is both environmentally friendly and helps combat the epidemic.\n\n# Open Application Interface\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to promote the banking sector’s development and provision of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in accordance with the Open API Framework. The framework is being implemented in four phases, with banks having already launched open APIs for the first and second phases and collaborating with third-party service providers using these APIs to develop a variety of innovative services and enhance customer experience. On the other hand, the HKMA is conducting research on the implementation of open APIs for the third and fourth phases and published a booklet in November detailing the survey results.\n\n# Trade linkage.\n\nTo provide importers and exporters with more convenient trade finance services, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority initiated a concept proof-of-concept study this year to explore the connection between “TradeConnect” and the trade finance blockchain platform under the People’s Bank of China. The first phase of the study was completed in the fourth quarter of this year and pilot testing has since begun. Banks in Hong Kong and Mainland China have already successfully completed a number of cross-border trade finance transactions using this connection.\n\n# Cross-border payment\n\nRegarding central bank digital currencies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Thailand continue to conduct joint research exploring the application of central bank digital currencies in cross-border payments, thereby facilitating the simultaneous settlement of Hong Kong dollar and Thai baht foreign exchange transactions between banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. The two sides have completed the first phase of research and published a joint report in January outlining the main research findings; they have also developed a prototype cross-border corridor network based on blockchain technology, striving to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of cross-border payments. The second phase of the project has commenced, aiming to explore commercial use cases for cross-border trade settlement and capital market transactions. Other central banks have also expressed strong interest in the project. The Bank for International Settlements, the Central Bank of the UAE, and the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China announced their participation in the project in early 2021.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2020年是峰迴路轉的一年，新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來前所未有的挑戰。資產市場於第1 季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後，在主要央行推出超寬鬆的貨幣政策及各地政府實施大規模的財政紓困措施帶動下，得以迅速反彈。由於主要央行大幅下調基準利率並重啟量化寬鬆措施，令國債收益率顯著下跌、債券價格上升。在此投資環境下，外匯基金在2020 年錄得2,358 億港元的投資收入，回報率為5.3%。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，以及未來基金存款與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為40：60。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，會以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線以確保有效的風險管理及監察。金管局亦定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），並已加強風險管理程序以配合外匯基金的多元化投資。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程。\n\n金管局訂有一套原則，以評估外匯基金投資項目的ESG風險與機會。就外聘投資經理所管理的資產組合而言，金管局透過獲委任的投資經理執行負責任投資。在甄選、委任及監察外聘投資經理的過程中，金管局會評估其落實ESG的不同範疇，包括ESG管治方面的組織架構、ESG標準及政策、將ESG因素併入投資程序中的情況，以及管理督導的業務活動，即代理投票和與投資組合公司的溝通（例如與投資組合公司管理層商討ESG的事宜）。為彰顯對負責任投資的重視，金管局透過外聘投資經理在管理督導方面扮演的角色，推動更完善的ESG做法。負責管理金管局的香港股票組合及中國內地股票主動投資管理組合的外聘投資經理，須承諾遵守證券及期貨事務監察委員會頒布的《負責任的擁有權原則》，若未能遵守則須作出解釋。至於負責管理已發展市場股票組合的外聘投資經理則需恪守國際公認的ESG標準。此外，金管局又展開聘任後監察計劃，以審視外聘投資經理的代理投票及與投資組合公司溝通的落實概況。\n\n由金管局內部人員負責管理的定息投資組合，亦將ESG因素融入債券投資的信用風險分析中。藉著擴大ESG數據來源以及在量化評估中提高ESG因素的權重，加強相關的分析。\n\n至於在公開市場的ESG投資，金管局自2015年起投資於綠色、社會責任及可持續債券（ESG債券），是這個市場的早期投資者之一。此外，金管局亦參與國際金融公司的「聯合貸款組合管理計劃」，而其投資對象聚焦於新興市場的可持續發展項目。在2020年，適逢市場供應增加，金管局增加ESG債券的投資。展望未來，金管局將繼續透過直接投資或持有ESG債券基金等方式，壯大其ESG債券組合。此外，金管局將透過採納ESG股票指數作為被動投資組合的投資基準，推動外聘投資經理建立以ESG為主題的股票投資方針。金管局在未來幾年將會繼續留意以ESG為主題的投資機會，例如主動式的ESG投資組合及低碳為題的投資工具。\n\n私募市場投資方面，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視專責合夥人的ESG政策及具體措施。金管局的長期增長組合積極投資於具備可持續特點的項目，包括可再生能源基建，而在房地產投資組合亦有吸納具有綠色及可持續特點的倉庫及其他建築物。金管局將在未來繼續物色具備可持續特點的項目，並在房地產投資方面將綠色認證列入為重要考慮因素。金管局與專責合夥人舉行年度ESG工作坊，就良好的ESG作業手法交流意見及經驗。在11月舉行的ESG工作坊上，一眾專責合夥人就新冠病毒疫情對其投資組合公司及ESG投資發展所造成的影響交換意見。為提高私募市場投資的ESG透明度，金管局已要求專責合夥人提供有關其投資項目的ESG資訊，例如氣候變化風險等，以便監察。\n\n金管局往後仍會密切觀察ESG標準的發展，評估如何將有關標準進一步融入投資程序，當中包括與理念相近的投資者及國際組織互動合作。金管局作為聯合國支持的《負責任投資原則》的簽署人之一，肩負作為全球倡導者的責任，日後將會參與制定ESG最佳作業手法，並推動其他投資者採納負責任的投資方法。金管局亦是非牟利機構 FCLTGlobal 的成員，該機構旨在透過舉辦工作坊及研究，鼓勵以長遠目標為本的業務及投資決策。金管局亦有參與「氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組」，並為「央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡」的成員。此外，金管局籌辦講座及積極參與投資業界舉辦的活動，分享及推廣有關ESG投資的理念。\n\n有關金管局的負責任投資政策架構，詳見「機構社會責任」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2020年的金融市場\n\n因應受新冠病毒疫情為全球經濟帶來的重大挑戰而推出的寬鬆貨幣及財政政策支持下，環球金融市場在年底時升至高位。環球股票市場於第1季經歷了大幅調整和震盪後迅速反彈，主要市場更錄得雙位數字的增長。美國標準普爾500指數上升16%，是2020年表現最佳的七大工業國股票指數。\n\n債市方面，主要已發展國家的債券收益率在第1季顯著下跌後繼續受壓。10年期美國國債收益率由年初的1.9%下跌約100基點，至年底的0.9%。由於主要國債價格急升，2020年從債市錄得非常可觀的估值收益。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美國息率向下令息差收窄，促使美元兌主要貨幣轉弱，而2020年下半年情況更為顯著，其中歐元及人民幣兌美元分別升值約9.0%及6.5%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2020年的表現。\n\n表 1 2020年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2020年錄得2,358億港元的投資收入，其中包括債券投資收益927億港元、香港股票投資收益40億港元、其他股票投資收益699億港元、非港元資產外匯估值上調96億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益596億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得140億港元估值收益。\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2020 was a year of dramatic twists and turns, as the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to the global economy. After a sharp correction and volatility in asset markets during the first quarter, they rebounded quickly, driven by ultra-loose monetary policies implemented by major central banks and large-scale fiscal relief measures enacted by governments worldwide. Significant cuts to benchmark interest rates by major central banks, coupled with the resumption of quantitative easing, led to a marked decline in government bond yields and a rise in bond prices. In this investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$235.8 billion in 2020, representing an investment return of 5.3%.\n\n# Exchange Stabilization Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, directly or indirectly. It may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the operation and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated to it and the provisions for further delegation by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained to support monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) to seek to maximize investment returns, consistent with the above objectives (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in the Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full backing for the monetary base in accordance with the provisions of the currency board system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the debt and equity markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the aim of preserving the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is prudently and gradually diversifying the asset allocation of part of the Exchange Fund into a wider range of asset classes, including emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is capped at one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus, plus the total of the portion of future fund deposits and deposits of the Exchange Fund’s subsidiaries that are linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Regarding deposits in the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe Exchange Fund accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations from time to time, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of its investment portfolio. However, the Future Fund is a primary individual example. The interest rate on deposits in the Future Fund is linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the weighting of the portfolios. The Future Fund has an approximate 40:60 weighting between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is expressed as a benchmark, representing the long-term asset mix the Exchange Fund may adopt to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guide and employs tactical asset allocation to seek returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is known as “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and define the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage their positions within the permissible range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Investment Office is responsible for investment and related risk management functions of the Exchange Fund. Staff of the office directly manage approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the supporting portfolio and part of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio includes investments in various global fixed income markets and implements the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through the use of derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also employs external investment managers responsible for managing approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for Exchange Fund investments, to achieve sustainable returns, and to allow the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily subject to market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, and the importance of risk management is self-evident. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed investment portfolios, along with rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The HKMA employs a three-line-of-defense model for investment-related activities to ensure effective risk management and oversight. The HKMA also regularly monitors major categories of investment risk – including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk – and has enhanced risk management procedures to accommodate the diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investments.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports responsible investment and integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the investment management processes for the Exchange Fund’s public and private market investments.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has established a set of principles to assess the ESG risks and opportunities of its Exchange Fund investment projects. With respect to assets managed by external investment managers, the HKMA implements responsible investment through the managers it appoints. Throughout the selection, appointment, and monitoring of external investment managers, the HKMA assesses their implementation of various ESG aspects, including the organizational structure for ESG governance, ESG standards and policies, the integration of ESG factors into investment processes, and stewardship activities such as proxy voting and engagement with investee companies (for example, discussing ESG matters with the management of investee companies). To demonstrate its commitment to responsible investment, the HKMA promotes improved ESG practices through the stewardship role played by external investment managers. External investment managers responsible for managing the HKMA’s Hong Kong equity portfolio and the actively managed China A-share portfolio are required to commit to adhering to the Securities and Futures Commission’s “Principles of Responsible Ownership” and to provide explanations for any non-compliance. External investment managers responsible for managing emerging market equity portfolios are required to adhere to internationally recognized ESG standards. In addition, the HKMA conducts post-appointment monitoring to review the implementation of proxy voting and engagement with investee companies by external investment managers.\n\nFixed-income investment portfolios managed by internal staff at the HKMA also incorporate ESG factors into the credit risk analysis of bond investments. This is achieved by expanding the sources of ESG data and increasing the weighting of ESG factors in quantitative assessments, thereby strengthening the related analysis.\n\nRegarding ESG investment in the public market, the HKMA has been investing in green, social responsibility, and sustainability bonds (ESG bonds) since 2015, making it one of the early investors in this market. In addition, the HKMA participates in the “Joint Loan Portfolio Management Program” of international financial institutions, with its investments focused on sustainable development projects in emerging markets. In 2020, coinciding with an increase in market supply, the HKMA increased its investment in ESG bonds. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to expand its ESG bond portfolio through direct investment or by holding ESG bond funds. Furthermore, the HKMA will promote externally appointed investment managers to establish ESG-themed equity investment strategies by adopting ESG stock indices as the investment benchmark for its passive investment portfolios. The HKMA will continue to monitor ESG-themed investment opportunities in the coming years, such as active ESG portfolios and low-carbon investment instruments.\n\nIn the private market investment arena, the HKMA reviews the ESG policies and specific measures of dedicated partners during the due diligence process. The HKMA’s long-term growth portfolio actively invests in projects with sustainable characteristics, including renewable energy infrastructure, and its real estate portfolio also incorporates warehouses and other buildings with green and sustainable features. The HKMA will continue to seek out projects with sustainable characteristics in the future, and will include green certifications as an important consideration in real estate investments. The HKMA holds annual ESG workshops with dedicated partners to exchange views and experiences on sound ESG practices. At the ESG workshop held in November, dedicated partners exchanged views on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their portfolio companies and the development of ESG investing. To enhance ESG transparency in private market investments, the HKMA has requested dedicated partners to provide ESG information regarding their investments, such as climate change risks, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how to further integrate them into its investment processes, including interacting and cooperating with like-minded investors and international organizations. As a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, the HKMA bears the responsibility of being a global advocate and will participate in the formulation of ESG best practices, and promote the adoption of responsible investment approaches by other investors. The HKMA is also a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to encourage long-term oriented business and investment decisions through workshops and research. The HKMA also participates in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and is a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System. In addition, the HKMA organizes seminars and actively participates in events hosted by the investment industry to share and promote the concepts of ESG investing.\n\nPlease refer to the chapter on “Institutional Social Responsibility” for details regarding the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s responsible investment policy framework.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n## 2020 Financial Markets\n\nSupported by the easing of monetary and fiscal policies introduced in response to the significant challenges posed to the global economy by the COVID-19 pandemic, global financial markets rose to high levels at the end of the year. After a significant correction and volatility in the first quarter, global stock markets rebounded rapidly, with major markets recording double-digit growth. The US S&P 500 Index rose by 16%, making it the best-performing stock index among the seven major industrial nations in 2020.\n\nIn the bond market, yields on major developed-country bonds continued to come under pressure after a significant decline in the first quarter. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds fell by approximately 100 basis points from 1.9% at the beginning of the year to 0.9% at year-end. Due to the sharp rise in major sovereign bond prices, 2020 saw very substantial valuation gains from the bond market.\n\nIn the currency market, declining U.S. interest rates led to a narrowing of interest rate differentials, causing the dollar to weaken against major currencies.

The session covered an introduction to the HKMA’s work, the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong banknotes, protecting personal digital keys, and the Deposit Protection Scheme.

A key focus of this educational work remains “Safeguarding Your Digital Keys,” and the HKMA has produced a series of short videos this year urging citizens to properly protect their financial accounts and personal information at all times and in all places. Given the increase in online scams during the COVID-19 pandemic, the HKMA reminds the public to be vigilant when shopping online or using personal identification information to avoid falling victim to fraudulent schemes.\n\nTo increase young people’s interest in working at the HKMA, the HKMA launched the public education web drama “STEPS” in 2020, and released a series of related posts on social media, introducing the HKMA’s work in areas such as currency, the linked exchange rate system, financial technology, financial inclusion, banking supervision and international cooperation.\n\nThe public education web drama *STEPS* uses a lighthearted approach to introduce the key functions of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority through the growth story of a young, newly employed individual.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been widely promoting messages about protecting personal digital keys through digital platforms and outdoor media.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with various stakeholders through a range of community engagement activities. One such initiative is the online financial literacy program for parents and children, “Little Financial Experts.” This program utilizes animated videos, online games, DIY toys, downloadable worksheets, and coloring contests to teach kindergarten and primary school students basic concepts about money and financial management, as well as fundamental knowledge regarding banking and payment services.\n\nThe animated video, featuring Dollar Pig and the Kim family, delivers messages on five themes.\n\nDemonstrate making toys from environmentally friendly materials.\n\nOther work related to youth education includes online financial literacy quizzes, online educational seminars for secondary school students and teachers, collaboration with a professional organization to produce comic books for primary school students and parents, and online seminars for tertiary students.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the Investor and Financial Education Council in enhancing the financial literacy and capability of Hong Kong citizens, and will study further collaboration with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of community engagement.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority Staff\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the government structure, but employs staff under terms and conditions that are not those of civil servants, in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The HKMA recruits, trains, and maintains a professional and highly capable team to fulfill its policy objectives and adapt flexibly to changing job requirements.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority had a staff complement of 1,005 in 2020. Throughout the year, the HKMA strived to meet the needs of new initiatives and an increasing workload by flexibly deploying existing resources, enhancing efficiency, and streamlining work procedures. The HKMA’s staff complement will remain at 1,005 in 2021, with existing resources being redeployed to address the following newly launched and expanded work areas:\n\n# Banking and Financial System Stability\n- Support policy development for “Wealth Connect” and other Greater Bay Area (GBA) private wealth management initiatives, as well as ongoing supervision of “Wealth Connect” business.\n- Handle licensing work under the Insurance Ordinance and the new over-the-counter derivatives regime, and conduct ethical supervision of virtual banks.\n- Implement new regulatory requirements regarding climate risks and strengthen prudential supervision of banks.\n\n# Reserve Management\n- Strengthen investment, risk management, and other necessary support to align with the continued expansion and diversification of foreign exchange fund investment operations.\n\n# Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre\n- To strengthen support for participation in the Financial Stability Board and other international working groups\n- To administer the recently proposed deemed benefit tax concession scheme and verify funds eligible for tax concessions\n\nTable 1 lists the establishment of positions and the actual number of staff at the HKMA by department.\n\nTable 1: HKMA Establishment and Actual Staff Numbers as of January 1, 2021\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary, through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, receives input from its subordinate governance committees and, with reference to market compensation levels and practices, determines the salary and terms of service for Hong Kong Monetary Authority staff. The compensation package includes cash compensation and mandatory provident fund contributions, along with a range of basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a variable pay component awarded annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) staff remuneration annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain advice from its governance committee. This review considers the governance committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of remuneration surveys for the financial industry conducted by independent human resources consulting firms, and other relevant factors. The remuneration of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be subject to special adjustments as a reward and to maintain its competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed and variable compensation based on individual employee performance. The variable compensation scheme applicable to employees responsible for investment is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration.

{"zh":"# 機構社會責任\n\n金管局致力履行機構社會責任，以成為負責任及可持續發展的機構為目標。金管局在不同領域履行此承諾，包括推動可持續發展及具環保意識的市場、關懷廣大社會、保護環境及締造友善的工作環境。\n\n為應對新冠病毒疫情，金管局推出多項措施，支援有需要的個人及企業，從而協助香港經濟渡過難關。\n\n# 市場環境\n\n# 綠色及可持續金融\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉及全球經濟可持續性的主要風險之一，作為社會重要環節之一的金融體系，亦難免會受到影響；而銀行作為金融體系的一部分，應更積極管理氣候風險。有見及此，金管局致力探究應對這項挑戰的方法，並正落實多項於2019年5月宣布推出的措施，促進綠色金融在香港的發展。有關措施包括分三階段推動綠色及可持續銀行業的發展：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n與業界建立一個共同框架，評估銀行目前的「綠色基準」，以及與國際組織合作，為本港銀行提供技術支援；\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色及可持續銀行業的監管期望及要求諮詢業界及其他持份者；以及\n\n# 第三階段\n\n集中落實、審視及評估銀行在這方面的進度。\n\n在國際層面，金管局參與多個國際組織，包括央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會轄下的氣候相關財務風險高級別工作組、東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議轄下銀行監管工作小組之下的可持續金融關注組及國際可持續金融平台。透過參與這些國際組織，金管局有機會為中央銀行界及監管機構在應對氣候變化的工作上作出貢獻，並能在制定本地架構時借鑑其他地區的經驗與觀點。\n\n金管局亦參與央行與監管機構綠色金融網絡下的多個工作組，包括微觀審慎監管工作組、宏觀金融工作組及促進綠色金融工作組。此外，金管局亦加入了兩個新設的工作組：研究工作組及彌補數據缺口工作組。研究工作組負責相關研究工作，而彌補數據缺口工作組旨在制定監管當局及金融機構評估氣候相關風險與機遇所需、但目前卻並未掌握的數據項目詳盡清單。有關金管局年內在推動綠色及可持續銀行業發展方面的工作，詳見「銀行體系穩定」一章。\n\n金管局在11月與國際金融公司聯合推出綠色商業銀行聯盟，協助各新興市場的銀行制定應對氣候變化的方案。作為聯盟的創始成員及首個區域執行理事，金管局i)在全球金融市場推動發展綠色商業銀行；ii)為商業銀行提供互相學習平台，獲取所需知識、工具及商業資訊，以制定其本身的綠色金融路線圖，並轉型為具公信力的綠色銀行；iii)促進溝通，並探討前沿議題推動全球綠色議程；以及iv)協助聯盟的成員合作，以及把握國際金融公司所識別在未來10年估計高達23萬億美元的新興市場綠色及氣候相關投資機會。\n\n本地方面，金管局與其他金融監管機構合作，協調金融業針對氣候和環境風險的措施應對。除了協助政府落實政府綠色債券計劃的相關工作外，金管局亦與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）共同發起成立了綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組），處理跨行業的監管及市場發展事宜。有關金管局年內在發展香港成為綠色及可持續金融樞紐方面的工作，詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章。\n\n# 綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組\n\n督導小組旨在協調金融業針對氣候及環境風險的措施應對、加快香港綠色及可持續金融的發展，以及支持政府的氣候策略。督導小組由金管局與證監會於5月共同發起成立，其他成員包括環境局、財經事務及庫務局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、保險業監管局及強制性公積金計劃管理局。\n\n自成立以來，督導小組設立了兩個技術工作專責團隊，分別負責研究及處理跨部門的監管事宜，以及協調跨機構的市場發展工作。\n\n督導小組在12月發布綠色及可持續金融策略，提出從六方面鞏固香港金融生態系統，長遠共建更綠色及更可持續的未來。督導小組亦宣布5個短期行動綱領，處理發展過程中一些最迫切的問題。\n\n金管局舉辦督導小組成立大會，金管局總裁余偉文先生（右三）為該小組的聯席主席。\n\n督導小組發布香港的綠色和可持續金融策略計劃及5個主要行動綱領。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資，即將環境、社會及管治(ESG)因素融入投資活動中。金管局作為規模龐大的資產擁有人，日益關注負責任投資，將對其基金經理如何進行投資活動產生影響。\n\n# 金管局的信念\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，將更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動所涉及的ESG相關風險。\n\n# 金管局的原則\n\n按金管局採取的指導性原則，當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。作為負責任的長期投資者，金管局在投資管理過程中，會因應情況採納以下的負責任投資原則：\n\n# 融入\n\n金管局相信ESG因素會對投資項目的長期價值帶來重大影響，因此將ESG因素融入投資分析程序，以辨察風險及物色良機。金管局將ESG因素併入公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。\n\n# 主動行使資產擁有權\n\n金管局就所持有的上市公司股票適當地行使股東權利，以維護投資的長期價值。金管局相信，顧及ESG因素的負責任企業行為，將有助創造長綫的股東利益。金管局期望外聘投資經理透過行使表決權及與獲投資公司溝通時，主動行使資產擁有權，藉以協助金管局履行對投資項目的擁有權責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n金管局致力與理念相近的投資者及監管機構合作，推動良好的長期投資管理手法，又出席公開活動並發表演講，分享更完善的ESG作業手法及鼓勵投資界採納負責任投資理念。\n\n有關金管局年內在負責任投資方面的工作，詳見「儲備管理」一章。\n\n# 金管局作為主動的負責任投資者，監察外聘投資經理的ESG作業手法\n\n# 金管局的期望\n\n金管局非常重視將ESG因素融入投資決定及主動行使資產擁有權等概念。為此，金管局在甄選聘任及監察外聘投資經理時，皆會考慮ESG因素。由於金管局認為就所持有的上市公司股票行使股東權利，是維護投資的長期價值的基本方針，因此會要求獲聘任的投資經理嚴肅對待主動行使資產擁有權一事。\n\n# 金管局的監察\n\n外聘投資經理須就其替金管局管理的上市股票組合的ESG表現接受評估。金管局透過溝通計劃，有系統地檢視外聘投資經理在不同範疇的ESG作業手法，例如其ESG評估架構、與獲投資公司的溝通，以及代理投票方面的工作。金管局在2020年選出若干外聘投資經理率先進行溝通計劃，當中不僅評估其ESG表現，亦檢視其有否代表金管局妥善行使資產擁有權。\n\n# 溝通成果\n\n金管局透過計劃識別出作業手法有問題的外聘投資經理，並採取跟進行動。下文列舉其中兩個例子。\n\n# 個案1\n\n金管局留意到股票投資經理A的ESG架構有改善空間，尤其應設立更有系統的方法去評估獲投資公司。金管局就此與A跟進，其後A進行全面的公司政策檢討，以實施一個更穩健的ESG架構。A更特別委任外聘顧問就ESG程序提供意見，反映加快落實改革的決心，並新設由高級管理層組成的ESG委員會，顯示對ESG的承擔及高級管理層對有關措施的支持。\n\n# 個案2\n\n金管局在檢視股票投資經理B的投票方法後，發現B的投票政策在多個範疇上都有不足之處，並要求其ESG主管作出審視。尤其B在過往的投票全數贊成管理層的建議，偏離其本身的代理投票指引。B其後承諾會加強公司的投票政策以符合期望，其中包括會提高ESG團隊成員的參與度，以及在遇上涉及重大管治問題時有可能對管理層投下反對票。\n\n在私募市場投資方面，金管局藉着其專責合夥人致力與相關投資組合公司在ESG事宜上合作，從而實現負責任投資。金管局留意到專責合夥人都貫徹對ESG的承擔，因他們認為此舉可有利創造投資組合公司的長期價值和確保回報的可持續性。下文列舉的兩個例子顯示可透過(i)設計改動及利用創新運作技術；以及(ii)在建造及營運綠色及可持續倉庫時融入減碳因素，以管理氣候變化風險。兩個例子都對環境產生顯著的正面影響，減少碳排放，避免有害物質，並同時透過降低成本及節省能源，提升運作效率。\n\n(i) 金管局有投資一間採用環保方案的害蟲防治公司。雖然傳統殺蟲劑及化學製品能有效殺滅害蟲，但若未能迅速清除或妥善棄置蟲屍，將會危害公共衛生。此外，化學成分的滲漏及棄置亦會造成環境問題。該公司採用的不含生物殺滅劑方案，透過設置捕蟲器以減少使用有害化學品。該公司亦利用與互聯網相連的動態感應器，遙距偵察是否已捕獲害蟲。藉着此項新技術，該公司能作出完善的路線規劃以收集捕獲的害蟲，減低出行里程，從而減少碳排放。該公司採用的方案令公司整體碳排的淨效應達到每美元淨銷售額0.36千克二氧化碳當量的低水平，接近法律服務及軟件出版等低碳行業的平均水平，實在令人鼓舞。\n\n(ii) 金管局有投資綠色及可持續倉庫。雖然建造業是碳排放的一大源頭，但有關的倉庫發展商在其整體倉庫建造與營運中，採用淨零碳排放程序，並制定衡量淨零碳排放基準的標準及指標，而建築計劃亦顧及所用材料與部件的可持續性。因此，所建造的倉庫減碳效率高，並具備可持續特點，包括太陽能加熱系統、電動車充電設施、自然採光及雨水收集等。\n\n根據獨立顧問的評估，按淨額計，有關倉庫建造的碳足跡較一般物流大廈的碳排放量低25.8%。為進一步抵銷建築工程所造成的碳排放，建造過程中更種植了32,799棵樹（以淨額計）。建成後倉庫的日常運作的碳排放量較一般倉庫少26.9%。\n","en":"# Institutional Social Responsibility\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, with the goal of becoming a responsible and sustainable institution. The HKMA demonstrates this commitment in various areas, including promoting sustainable development and environmentally conscious markets, caring for the wider community, protecting the environment, and creating a friendly working environment.\n\nTo address the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched a series of measures to support individuals and businesses in need, thereby helping the Hong Kong economy navigate these challenging times.\n\n# Market Environment\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks impacting human well-being and the sustainability of the global economy, and the financial system, as an important component of society, is inevitably affected. As part of the financial system, banks should more proactively manage climate-related risks. In light of this, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge and is implementing a number of measures announced in May 2019 to promote the development of green finance in Hong Kong. These measures include promoting the development of green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase One\n\nEstablish a common framework with the industry to assess the current “green benchmarks” of banks, and collaborate with international organizations to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase Two\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on regulatory expectations and requirements for green and sustainable banking; and\n\n# Phase Three\n\nFocus on implementing, reviewing, and evaluating the bank’s progress in this regard.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA participates in a number of international organizations, including the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the Climate-related Financial Risks High-Level Work Stream under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Sustainable Finance Focus Group under the Banking Supervision Committee of the East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EAPCB), and the International Sustainable Finance Platform. Through participation in these organizations, the HKMA has the opportunity to contribute to the work of central banks and regulators in addressing climate change, and to draw on the experiences and perspectives of other jurisdictions when developing the local framework.\n\nThe HKMA also participates in several working groups under the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), including the Microprudential Supervision Group, the Macrofinancial Group, and the Green Finance Group. In addition, the HKMA has joined two newly established working groups: the Research Group and the Data Gap Filling Group. The Research Group is responsible for related research work, while the Data Gap Filling Group aims to develop a detailed list of data items required by regulators and financial institutions to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, but which are currently unavailable. Details of the HKMA’s work this year in promoting the development of green and sustainable banking are set out in the chapter on “Financial System Stability”.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly launched the Green Banking Alliance with the International Finance Corporation in November to help banks in emerging markets develop strategies to address climate change. As a founding member and the first regional executive council, the HKMA will i) promote the development of green banking in global financial markets; ii) provide a platform for commercial banks to learn from each other and acquire the knowledge, tools, and business information needed to formulate their own green finance roadmaps and transform into credible green banks; iii) facilitate communication and explore cutting-edge issues to advance the global green agenda; and iv) assist members of the Alliance in collaborating and capitalizing on emerging market green and climate-related investment opportunities identified by the International Finance Corporation, estimated at up to US$23 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nLocally, the HKMA is collaborating with other financial regulators to coordinate the financial industry’s response to climate and environmental risks. In addition to assisting the Government in implementing its green bond program, the HKMA has also jointly established the Cross-Agency Steering Group on Green and Sustainable Finance (Steering Group) with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to address cross-sectoral regulatory and market development matters. Details of the HKMA’s work this year on developing Hong Kong as a green and sustainable finance hub can be found in the chapter “Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre.”\n\n# Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Committee\n\nThe Steering Group aims to coordinate the financial industry’s response to climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong, and support the government’s climate strategies. Jointly launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission in May, the Steering Group also includes representatives from the Environment Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Insurance Authority, and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority.\n\nSince its establishment, the steering committee has set up two dedicated technical working groups, one responsible for researching and handling cross-departmental regulatory matters, and the other for coordinating market development work across institutions.\n\nThe Steering Group released the Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy in December, outlining six areas to strengthen Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem and collaboratively build a greener and more sustainable future in the long run. The Steering Group also announced five short-term action plans to address some of the most pressing issues in the development process.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) held the inaugural meeting of its supervisory committee, with HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue (third from right) serving as a co-chairperson of the committee.\n\nThe Steering Group has released Hong Kong’s Green and Sustainable Finance Strategy and five key action plans.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports responsible investment, integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. As a large-scale asset owner, the HKMA is increasingly focused on responsible investment, which will impact how its fund managers conduct their investment activities.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Beliefs\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that by appropriately emphasizing responsible investment and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments, it will more effectively achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and mitigate ESG-related risks associated with investment activities.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Principles\n\nIn line with the guiding principles adopted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, ESG investments are generally prioritized when their risk-adjusted long-term returns are comparable to those of other investment options. As a responsible long-term investor, the HKMA incorporates the following responsible investment principles into its investment management process as appropriate.\n\n# Integration\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that ESG factors will have a significant impact on the long-term value of investment projects, and therefore incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis procedures to identify risks and opportunities. The HKMA integrates ESG factors into its investment management processes for both public and private markets.\n\n# Active exercise of asset ownership rights.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority appropriately exercises shareholder rights in listed companies it holds shares in, to safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour considering ESG factors will contribute to long-term shareholder interests. The HKMA expects external investment managers to proactively exercise ownership, through the exercise of voting rights and communication with investee companies, to assist the HKMA in fulfilling its ownership responsibilities with respect to its investments.\n\n# Cooperation\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to collaborating with like-minded investors and regulators to promote sound long-term investment practices, and participates in public events and delivers speeches to share best practices in ESG operations and encourage the investment community to adopt responsible investment principles.\n\nDetails regarding the HKMA’s work on responsible investment within the year can be found in the “Reserve Management” chapter.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as an active and responsible investor, monitors the ESG practices of its external investment managers.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Expectations\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority places great importance on incorporating ESG factors into investment decisions and proactively exercising ownership rights. To this end, the HKMA considers ESG factors when selecting, appointing, and monitoring external investment managers. As the HKMA believes that exercising shareholder rights in listed companies it holds is fundamental to preserving the long-term value of its investments, it requires appointed investment managers to take the proactive exercise of ownership rights seriously.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Supervision.\n\nExternally hired investment managers must be assessed on the ESG performance of the listed equity portfolios they manage for the HKMA. The HKMA systematically reviews the ESG practices of externally hired investment managers in different areas through a communication program, such as their ESG assessment frameworks, communication with investee companies, and proxy voting work. In 2020, the HKMA selected a number of externally hired investment managers to pilot the communication program, which not only assessed their ESG performance but also reviewed whether they had properly exercised ownership rights on behalf of the HKMA.\n\n# Communication outcomes \/ Results of communication \/ Communication achievements\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority identified outsourced investment managers with problematic operational practices through its review process and took follow-up actions. The following are two examples.\n\n# Case 1\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority noted that there was room for improvement in the ESG framework of fund manager A, particularly regarding the establishment of a more systematic approach to assessing investee companies. The HKMA followed up with A on this matter, after which A conducted a comprehensive review of its company policies to implement a more robust ESG framework. A specifically appointed external consultants to provide advice on ESG procedures, reflecting a commitment to accelerating the implementation of reforms, and established a new ESG committee comprised of senior management, demonstrating its commitment to ESG and the support of senior management for the related measures.\n\n# Case 2\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, after reviewing the voting methods of stock investment manager B, found deficiencies in B’s voting policies in several areas and has requested its ESG head to conduct a review. Specifically, B had previously voted in favor of management’s proposals in all instances, deviating from its own proxy voting guidelines. B subsequently committed to strengthening the company’s voting policies to meet expectations, including increasing the involvement of ESG team members and potentially voting against management in cases involving significant governance issues.\n\nIn the realm of private market investments, the HKMA collaborates with its dedicated fund managers on ESG matters to achieve responsible investing. The HKMA has noted the consistent commitment of these dedicated fund managers to ESG, as they believe it can contribute to the long-term value creation and ensure the sustainability of returns for portfolio companies. The following two examples demonstrate how climate change risks can be managed through (i) design modifications and the utilization of innovative operating technologies; and (ii) incorporating decarbonization factors when constructing and operating green and sustainable warehouses. Both examples have a significant positive impact on the environment, reducing carbon emissions, avoiding harmful substances, and simultaneously improving operational efficiency through cost reduction and energy conservation.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has invested in a pest control company that employs environmentally friendly solutions. While traditional pesticides and chemical products can effectively kill pests, failure to promptly remove or properly dispose of carcasses can pose a threat to public health. Furthermore, leakage and disposal of chemical components can cause environmental problems. The company’s approach utilizes non-biocidal pest control methods, employing traps to reduce the use of harmful chemicals. It also uses internet-connected dynamic sensors to remotely monitor pest capture rates. This new technology allows the company to optimize collection routes for captured pests, reducing travel distances and thereby lowering carbon emissions. The company’s solution results in a net carbon footprint of just 0.36 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of net sales, a low level comparable to low-carbon industries such as legal services and software publishing – a truly encouraging result.\n\n(ii) The HKMA invests in green and sustainable warehouses. While the construction industry is a major source of carbon emissions, the warehouse developers involved employ net-zero carbon procedures throughout the construction and operation of their warehouses, and have established standards and metrics to measure net-zero carbon emissions. Furthermore, building plans consider the sustainability of materials and components used. Consequently, the constructed warehouses are highly carbon-efficient and possess sustainable features, including solar water heating systems, electric vehicle charging facilities, natural lighting, and rainwater harvesting.\n\nAccording to an independent assessment, the carbon footprint of the warehouse, measured on a net basis, is 25.8% lower than the carbon emissions of a typical logistics building.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第187至289頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2020年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2020年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2020年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2021年4月1日\n\n# 1 主要業務\n\n金融管理專員根據財政司司長以外匯基金（基金）管理人身分授予的權力，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文管理基金。基金的主要業務為捍衛港元匯率及維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定健全。\n\n基金的資產分作四個不同的組合來管理：支持組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及策略性資產組合。根據香港的貨幣發行局制度，支持組合的資產與貨幣基礎完全相配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。策略性資產組合持有香港特別行政區（香港特區）政府為策略目的而購入，並列入基金的帳目內的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股票。經營分部資料載於附註32。\n\n# 2 主要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 符合準則聲明\n\n本財務報表是按照香港財務報告準則（此乃綜合詞彙，包括香港會計師公會頒布的所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則及詮釋）及香港公認會計原則而編製。有關基金及其附屬公司（統稱為「集團」）所採納的主要會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會頒布了若干新增或經修訂的香港財務報告準則並於集團的本會計期首次生效或可供提前採納。集團因首次採納其中適用的準則而引致本會計期及前會計期的會計政策改變（如有）已反映在本財務報表，有關資料載於附註3。\n\n# 2.2 財務報表的編製基準\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團於聯營公司及合營公司的權益。主要附屬公司、聯營公司及合營公司的主要業務載於附註17及18。\n\n本財務報表的編製基準是按原值成本法計量，惟下述按公平值計量的資產及負債除外：\n- 衍生金融工具（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入收支帳目的金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6）；\n- 按公平值計入其他全面收益的金融資產（附註2.6）；\n- 黃金（附註2.10）；及\n- 投資物業（附註2.11）。\n\n編製符合香港財務報告準則的財務報表需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，而有關判斷、估計及假設會影響會計政策的採納及資產、負債、收入及支出的呈報數額。此等估計及相關的假設是根據以往經驗及其他在有關情況下認為合適的因素而制定。在欠缺其他現成數據的情況下，則採用此等估計及假設作為判斷有關資產及負債的帳面值的基準，估計結果與實際價值或有不同。\n\n此等估計及相關假設將不斷檢討修訂。如作出的修訂只影響本會計期，有關修訂會在該期間內確認，但如影響本期及未來的會計期，有關修訂便會在該期及未來期間內確認。\n\n管理層就採納香港財務報告準則所作出對財務報表有重大影響的判斷以及估計不確定性的主要來源於附註2.19披露。\n\n若干2019年的比較數字已重新分類，以配合本年度集團財務報表的呈報方式。\n\n# 2.3 附屬公司及非控股權益\n\n附屬公司指集團所控制的實體。如集團因其參與該實體的營運而承擔有關浮動回報的風險或享有有關權利，且有能力對該實體行使權力而影響該等回報時，即屬擁有該實體的控制權。在評估集團是否擁有權力時，只考慮由集團及其他方所持有的實質權利。\n","en":"# Exchange Stabilization Fund\n\n# Report of the Auditor-General\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nWe hereby certify that we have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 187 to 289, which financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at December 31, 2020, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI consider that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group at December 31, 2020 and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive in Council under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of opinion.\n\nI have performed the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities under those standards are set out in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements’ section of this report. As part of an audit in accordance with those standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I am independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements in Hong Kong, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those requirements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. I addressed these matters in the course of my audit of, and in forming my opinion on, the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for all other information. This other information includes all information contained in the Monetary Authority’s 2020 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to any other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on any other information.\n\nWith regard to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information to consider whether that information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Based on my work, if I believe that other information contains a material misstatement, I am required to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Controller and the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Division and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with Respect to Financial Statements.\n\nFinancial management officers are responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls as they deem necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial management officers are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that expresses my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will detect all material misstatements. A material misstatement is a misstatement in the financial statements that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of those financial statements.\n\nDuring the course of my audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements resulting from fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to address those risks; and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for my opinion. Because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls, the risk of not detecting material misstatements resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting those resulting from error;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this does not involve expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by the Financial Secretary, as well as the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures;\n- Determine whether the Financial Secretary’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw users’ attention to the related disclosures in the auditor’s report. If those disclosures are inadequate, I must issue a qualified audit report. My conclusion is based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly represent transactions and events; and\n- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to form an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Council regarding the audit scope and timeline of the plan, as well as any significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements concerning independence, and communicate to them any relationships and other matters that could reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, as well as any related safeguards where applicable.\n\nBased on my communication with the Audit Committee under the purview of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for this period and therefore constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in my auditor’s report, unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or, in extremely rare circumstances, when I determine that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public benefit derived from such communication.\n\nAuditor-General\nChu Nai-chang\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\n# Main Businesses\n\nThe Financial Secretary, acting in his capacity as manager of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), delegates powers to the Financial Management Officer to manage the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66). The Fund’s primary objectives are to defend the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and maintain the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Fund’s assets are managed through four distinct portfolios: the Support Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio, and the Strategic Asset Portfolio. In accordance with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s exchange rate system, the assets of the Support Portfolio are fully matched with the monetary base. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the debt and equity markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Asset Portfolio holds shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for strategic purposes and recorded in the Fund’s accounts. Segmental information is set out in note 32.\n\n## 2 Principal Accounting Policies\n\n## 2.1 Compliance Statement\n\nThese financial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (which is a body of comprehensive financial reporting standards comprising all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards and Interpretations) and Hong Kong Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Group”) is set out below.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued several new or amended Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards that became effective for the first time during the Group’s current accounting period or were available for early adoption. Changes in accounting policies for the current and prior accounting periods resulting from the Group’s initial adoption of these applicable standards (if any) have been reflected in these financial statements and are detailed in note 3.\n\n## 2.2 Basis for Preparation of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal business activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are set out in notes 17 and 18.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value:\n- Derivative financial instruments (Note 2.6);\n- Financial assets and financial liabilities through profit or loss (Note 2.6);\n- Financial assets through other comprehensive income (Note 2.6);\n- Gold (Note 2.10); and\n- Investment properties (Note 2.11).\n\nPreparing financial statements in compliance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the adoption of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. These estimates and related assumptions are made based on historical experience and other factors considered appropriate under the circumstances. In the absence of readily available data, these estimates and assumptions serve as the basis for determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, and the resulting estimates may differ from actual values.\n\nThese estimates and related assumptions will be continuously reviewed and revised. If the revisions made only affect the current accounting period, the revisions will be recognized within that period. However, if they affect the current and future accounting periods, the revisions will be recognized in both the current and future periods.\n\nManagement’s judgments and estimates that are significant to the financial statements and the primary sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed in note 2.19.\n\nCertain 2019 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the presentation of the Group’s financial statements for the current year.\n\n## 2.3 Subsidiaries and Non-Controlling Interests\n\nA subsidiary refers to an entity controlled by the Group. Control of an entity exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights held by the Group and other parties are considered.\n"}
