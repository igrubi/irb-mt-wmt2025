{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石。\n\n自1983年起生效的聯繫匯率制度，幫助香港抵禦多次挑戰和衝擊，展現了其作為香港經濟繁榮和國際金融中心地位的基石的重要作用。儘管當年外部和本地環境困難，聯繫匯率制度繼續暢順且有序地運作，再次證明了其在不確定性時代的韌性。香港的銀行體系亦仍然穩健。事實證明（事實勝於雄辯）：港元匯率仍然穩定，並且在近月增長至兌換範圍的強大範圍內，而銀行存款在當年繼續增長。簡單而言，沒有觀察到從港元或銀行體系流出的明顯跡象。\n\n香港的貨幣和銀行體系的穩定反映了我們體系的穩健，亦反映了對我們體系的強大信心。這並非一夜之間發生，而是透過多年的努力建立緩衝，加強監察，並輔以我們對社交媒體平台上的謠言的迅速回應。\n\n我們的準備工作在多年來為雨天所做的，已經建立了一個穩固的根基，並為香港的貨幣和銀行體系提供了強大的緩衝。此外，除了我們公共資金中龐大的外匯儲備外，我們的銀行體系擁有強大的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性以及非常良好的資產品質，無論以國際或歷史標準來看皆是如此。自2009年起落實的八輪針對房地產按揭的逆周期宏觀審慎措施亦大大加強了銀行抵禦房地產市場逆轉的能力。\n\n市場監察和銀行監理是我們維持貨幣和銀行穩定的工作核心部分，我們一直適時加強我們的監察和監理框架。除了緊密監察銀行的信貸和流動性風險外，我們在本年的一項新猷是利用從銀行收集的細緻數據和科技，提升我們監察港元資金和金融市場活動的能力，以更深入和適時的方式進行。 鑒於快速變化 的經濟和經營環境，壓力測試和應急規劃亦已加強。\n\n事實上，我們強大的監管制度已獲得國際社會的強大認可。在過去一年，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定香港具備良好條件，可以應對周期性及結構性變化，鑒於其重大的緩衝。香港在打擊洗錢和恐怖分子融資方面的有效法律和制度框架亦取得正面評估，使香港成為亞太區首個在金融行動特別工作組（FATF）互認評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的根基，對於保障貨幣和金融穩定至關重要。為了維持市場信心，我們必須對任何可能造成對香港貨幣或銀行系統懷疑的惡意謠言保持高警覺，並迅速回應。鑒於現今社交媒體和即時通訊的普及，這點特別重要。儘管在社會事件爆發期間，恐慌製造者透過社交媒體平台傳播了不同謠言，但我們透過社交媒體以及傳統媒體對這些謠言所做的迅速且明確澄清，證明了其有用性及有效性，有助於釋除疑慮，制止不實謠言進一步傳播，並維持國際及公眾對我們系統的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，發揮著基本作用，確保社會和經濟的暢順運作。儘管自下半年以來經營環境困難，銀行業仍與其他各方一同工作，竭盡全力維持其核心功能的正常運作，並繼續服務企業和公眾。\n\n此外，除了存款和轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的一個重要功能是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們明白並關切企業，尤其中小企，在困難經濟狀況下所面對的資金周轉問題。在保障銀行穩定的前提下，我們已推出一系列措施，以確保繼續向中小企提供資金支持。特別是，銀行逆周期資本緩衝比率在10月2019年和3月2020年兩次下調，總計150個基點至1.0%；銀行存款準備金率亦在4月2020年下調一半。 這些措施釋放了約一萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多向企業（包括中小企）提供貸款的空間。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行界中小企貸款協調機制——匯聚香港主要銀行，共同探索和討論具體措施，以加強對中小企的資金支持。我樂見不少銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，並引入了例如針對有需要的客戶提供還息不還本等紓緩措施，以克服難關。\n\n鑒於部分中小企反映開立銀行帳戶存在困難，而這正是使用各項銀行服務的首個步驟，我們在過去數年來致力應對這個問題。我們的努力已作出成效，企業開戶的改善情況可見。為進一步推動金融普及，香港金融管理局推動推出分級帳戶服務——簡易帳戶，並精簡客戶盡職審查流程，為初創企業和中小企提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。至今已有超過2,800個簡易帳戶開立。\n\n# 國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上\n\n我們一直留意到需要在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡。鑒於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們需要加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其更長期穩定。目前有四個主要工作範疇：科技、綠色金融、與內地金融互聯互通，以及人才發展。\n\n# 迎向科技於數碼時代\n\n香港自2016年設立香港金融管理局金融科技便利辦公室，以及2017年引入智能銀行倡議以來，在推動金融科技發展方面一直快速發展。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活力於快速支付系統（轉數快）的強大勢頭中可見，它是全球首個多幣、跨行及電子錢包，實時零售支付平台。轉數快登記數目在短短15個月內達到四百萬，相當於人口750萬市民的高滲透率。政府亦採用轉數快為市民提供繳交稅款、差餉和水費的更大方便。預期越來越多企業會使用這種快速、安全和方便的方式收取及付款，以提升效率。\n\n在銀行業，於應用金融科技於其銀行服務及營運方面，看到重大進展。根據金管局進行的一項研究，接近九成受訪的零售銀行已採用或正計劃採用人工（智能）在其業務應用中。在金管局的促成下，銀行已應用大數據及消費者行為（分析）於其個人信貸產品。 他們亦已推出超過800開放應用程式編程介面，涵蓋一系列銀行產品及服務。 在鼓勵銀行使用金融科技的同時，我們沒有忽略加強科技風險管理及於數碼銀行服務中保障消費者的需要。 適時的監管指引已於這些範疇提供給銀行。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行另一個巨大興趣的領域，因為它具有支持銀行更有效和有效益地進行監管合規和風險管理，特別是在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面的潛在能力。為了促進 Regtech 的更廣泛行業採用和更廣泛的 Regtech 生態系統建立，香港金融管理局於 11月舉辦了首屆 AML\/CFT Regtech 論壇，並發布了首個 Regtech 電子報，以討論 Regtech 的盡快應用情況。與此同時，香港金融管理局作為銀行監管機構，正在探討監管科技（Suptech）的使用，包括新數據科學和分析，以提升工作成效和效率。我們已經開展了一系列研究，並制定了之後幾年內落實 Suptech 的藍圖。\n\n從更廣的角度來看，這僅僅是銀行業金融科技旅程的開始。金管局在今年批出（牌照）8個虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行於2020年3月正式推出其服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行已透過金管局的金融科技監管沙盒開始先導試驗。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及向香港市民引入更多創新和多元的銀行服務，將幫助提高我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n更多精彩發展亦預期在國際層面出現。在成功完成一個連接我們區塊鏈貿易融資平台eTradeConnect與其歐洲對接夥伴的試驗後，我們正在進行另一試驗，與中國人民銀行平台合作，為跨境貿易的數碼化鋪路。我們已開始與泰國銀行合作進行一項聯合研究項目，以研究中央銀行數碼貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行亦於11月在香港投入首個創新樞紐中心運作，以促進中央銀行界別內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地證明了香港在金融科技發展方面的領先全球地位。\n\n# 推動綠色及永續金融，以求更好未來\n\n氣候相關風險在近月來備受全球關注。為貢獻全球應對此挑戰的努力，香港金融管理局在5月公布三項關鍵措施，以推動香港在不同領域的綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，金管局正推動一個三個階段的策略，以推動綠色和可持續銀行業務。第一階段已制定評估銀行「綠色基準」的框架，以供業界諮詢，為第二階段制定銀行業的監管期望和要求，以及第三階段的落實鋪路。\n\n作為外匯基金的經理，金管局積極推進負責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素納入其投資活動。具體而言，我們已採用優先（考慮）綠色及ESG投資的原則，前提是其長線回報與其他投資在風險調整後相若。在2015年作為早期投資者之一投資綠色債券市場後，我們將繼續增長我們的綠色債券投資組合，並投資其他ESG資產。我們亦將攜手理念相近的投資者及監管機構，透過參與國際組織，推動ESG的最佳實踐。\n"}
{"en":"# Highlights of 2019\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy softens in 2019 amid global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade tensions and local social incidents, while the labour market faces increasing pressures.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains sound and resilient, with strong capital positions, robust liquidity and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the challenging external and internal environment, Hong Kong’s monetary system is firmly intact, as evidenced by the stable Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets. This reflects not only the robustness of but also strong confidence in Hong Kong’s monetary system. \n\nA new Resolution Facility is introduced and a number of refinements are made within the HKMA’s updated Liquidity Facilities Framework.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA puts great effort in monitoring the credit and liquidity risk management of banks to maintain banking stability. Good progress is also made on promoting smart banking, including the granting of eight virtual bank licences and encouraging the adoption of regulatory technology. These efforts are complemented by strengthened supervision of banks’ technology risk management and enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nThe HKMA streamlines investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while taking further steps to promote a customer-centric bank culture.\n\nHong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime earns positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making it the first FATF-member jurisdiction in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in FATF’s fourth-round Mutual Evaluation.\n\nNew rules and regulations are rolled out to enhance the banking regulatory regime in line with the latest international standards. A three-phased approach is announced to promote green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA makes significant progress in operationalising the resolution regime for banks, in particular driving the build-up of a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity at domestic systemically important banks to promote financial stability.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong is gaining strong momentum, with good progress in the implementation of the Open Application programming Interface Framework in the banking sector, establishment of the world’s first Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Centre, and continued increase in the use of the Faster payment System for e-payments.\n\nHong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. In the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, financial connectivity with the Mainland is being enhanced, and access to financial services by Hong Kong residents is made more convenient.\n\nMuch effort is made to open up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, particularly in infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds.\n\nThe Hong Kong Academy of Finance is set up to serve as a centre of excellence for developing financial leadership and a repository of knowledge in monetary and financial research, including applied research.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves the second highest investment income on record, of HK$262.2 billion, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\nThe HKMA deepens its effort in investment diversification, especially into the LongTerm Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009. There is also encouraging progress in advancing responsible investment.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through traditional and social media, website, Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nWithin the institution, the HKMA attaches great importance to upholding corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2019年在全球經濟放緩、持續美國與中國貿易摩擦以及本地社會事件之下回軟，而勞動力市場則面臨增加的壓力。\n\n香港銀行業保持穩健且有韌性，擁有強大資本，充裕流動性及健康資產素質。\n\n# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管困難的外部和內部環境，香港的貨幣制度依然穩健，這反映在港元匯率的穩定以及外匯和貨幣市場的暢順運作。這不僅反映了香港貨幣制度的穩健，亦體現了對香港貨幣制度的強大信心。\n\n一個新的解決方案機制被引入，並在金管局修訂的流動性設施框架內作出數目優化措施。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金管局投放巨大努力監察銀行信貸及流動性風險管理，以維持銀行體系穩定。在推動智能銀行方面亦作出良好進展，包括授予8個虛擬銀行牌照，以及鼓勵採用監管科技。這些努力輔以加強對銀行科技風險管理的監察，以及加強數碼金融服務的消費者保護。\n\n香港金管局理順投資者保護措施，以提升顧客經驗，同時採取進一步舉措以推動以客戶為中心的銀行文化。\n\n香港的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資制度獲得正面評估，成為亞太區首個取得FATF第四輪互認評估整體合規結果的成員。\n\n新規則和法規已推出，以提升銀行監管制度，符合最新的國際標準。一個三個階段的策略已公布，以推動香港的綠色和可持續銀行業，成為應對氣候變遷的全球努力的一部分。\n\n與此同時，香港金融管理局作出重大進展，以具體化銀行解決機制，特別是推動本地系統重要銀行建立一層新的吸納虧損能力，以推動金融穩定。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融科技生態系統正在增強強大勢頭，銀行業在開放應用程式介面框架的落實方面取得良好進展，設立了全球首個國際結算銀行創新樞紐中心，以及電子支付對快速支付系統的繼續增加使用量。\n\n香港保持在離岸人民幣業務的全球樞紐的堅定立足點。在粵港澳大灣區發展的背景下，與內地的金融互聯互通正在加強，並且香港居民獲得金融服務更加方便。\n\n大量努力作出以開放新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，特別是在基礎設施投資和融資、綠色金融和私募股權基金方面。\n\n香港金融學院的設立旨在服務為培育金融領導人才和貨幣及金融研究的知識庫，包括應用研究。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受惠於利好投資環境，金管局錄得第二最高投資收入紀錄，達至2,622億港元，相當於投資回報率6.6%。\n\n香港金融管理局尤其加強對長期增長投資組合（LTGP）的多元化投資努力。自2009年成立以來，LTGP錄得年化內部收益率達12.6%。亦見有鼓勵的進展，正在推動責任投資。\n\n# 公司職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過傳統媒體和社交媒體、網站、資訊中心以及各項其他渠道，保持與社群和市場的有效溝通，以促進公眾對其政策和營運的了解。\n\n在機構內，香港金融管理局非常重視維持企業管治，透過支持員工的專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律和提升資訊科技安全來應對新措施落實所帶來的挑戰，以及工作複雜度增加的情況。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents.

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟於2019年收縮，反映全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易衝突及本地社會事件。鑒於下半年經濟狀況急轉直下，勞動力市場面對增加的壓力。由於豬肉價格急升，通脹亦增加。預期2020年的經濟表現將維持困難，因為新型冠狀病毒疫情對已經轉弱的經濟雪上加霜。鑒於困難的經濟環境，政府及金管局已推出措施以支持經濟，尤其家庭和中小企業。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 實際活動\n\n隨着2018年2.9%的增長，香港經濟在2019年收縮了1.2%，標誌着自2009年以來的首個年度收縮。特別是，香港經濟在下半年進入衰退，經季節性調整的實際國內生產總值（GDP）連續在第二、三分之一和第4季收縮（表1）。經濟活動的下跌反映了整體需求的顯著減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件影響了下半年消費活動和情緒，私人消費支出記錄了自2003年以來的首個年度下跌。整體投資支出亦在低迷的商業情緒下下降。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩以及在美中貿易摩擦之下徵收的額外關稅，導致香港商品出口下跌。服務出口亦出現紀錄以來最大年度下跌，因為社會事件導致入境旅遊嚴重轉差。由於國內和轉口需求減少，商品和服務的進口亦轉差。從淨值的角度來看，淨貿易在2019年帶來支持GDP（圖1），因為總進口下降的速度甚至更快於總出口。\n\n鑒於強大的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間引入多項措施，以減輕居民的財政負擔，保障就業，並支持企業，特別是中小企以及零售、食品、運輸和旅遊等受重創行業。為讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，並幫助緩和經濟週期，金管局於10月14日公布降低銀行逆週期資本緩衝比率，由2.5%減少至2.0%，從而為銀行提供更多靈活性，釋放2000億至3000億港元的銀行信貸予企業，包括中小企，亦設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制。9月引入了中小企融資擔保計劃（SFGS）80%擔保產品的新措施，讓面對資金流轉轉弱的中小企借款人申請還息不還本，以獲得即時幫助。此外，12月引入了SFGS下的新九成貸款擔保產品，為中小企、經營經驗相對較少企業以及尋求設立自己事業的專業人士提供額外支持，以取得融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n2019年，港元匯率和貨幣市場運作暢順且有序。港元匯率在該年內仍然大致穩定。隨着3月觸發弱方兌換承諾，金管局以每1港元兌1美元7.85的價格向銀行購買港元，並出售美元，導致根據掛鈎匯率制度的設計，綜合結餘下跌。港元銀行同業拆息在更長期方面仍然大致穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，多家零售銀行在10月接近年底，隨着美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調，將最佳貸款利率調低了12.5個基點。至於貨幣總量方面，2019年銀行總貸款增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所增加，而全年的總存款增長了2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n潛在的通貨膨脹率，剔除政府一次性救濟措施的影響後，於2019年輕微上升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%。通貨膨脹的輕微增加主要帶動於自5月以來豬肉供應受阻導致的豬肉價格上漲（圖2）。撇除基本食品項目，價格壓力在全年維持溫和水平。特別是，消費物價通脹中的房屋組成部分與較早前的私人住宅租金整合同步放緩。大致而言，名義工資的溫和增長和商業租金的放緩增加幫助控制了本地企業成本。在外部，進口價格通脹放緩，符合一些香港主要進口來源地的通脹下跌，在整體經濟增長放緩的背景之下。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n勞動力市場在2019年上半年仍然大致有韌性，但在下半年面對增加的壓力（圖3）。在首個兩個季度維持在多年低位的2.8%之後，季節性調整後的失業率在第三季度上升至2.9%，在年底上升至3.3%，其中與消費和旅遊相關的行業錄得更為可見的上升，在社會事件之下亦然。整體勞動力需求在下半年的部分時間內亦明顯收縮，原因是總就業人數和私營部門空缺數目減少。勞動力需求的減少在零售、住宿和食品服務業以及進出口貿易和建築業尤為明顯。在供應範圍內，勞動力參與率輕微下降，部分原因是對衰退的周期性回應。隨著勞動力市場面對增加的壓力，名義工資和收入的增長顯示出接近年底時放緩的跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在19年經歷急升的波動。在首四個月市場攀升後，恆生指數在5月因部分憂慮美中貿易摩擦升溫而大幅下跌（圖4）。雖然在6月因主要中央銀行的貨幣政策信號轉為寬鬆而收復部分失地，但股價在世界各地經濟增長放緩和本地事件的影響下再次受到壓力。在年底接近時，隨着美中達成「第一階段」貿易協議的公布，股價重新爭取到一些上升勢頭。恆生指數以28,190點結束該年，整體錄得9.1%的年度增長。相反，平均每日成交額較較早前一年下跌約19%。一間重大內地科技公司和領先啤酒製造商的上市，幫助首次公開招股（首次公開招股）籌集的股本擴展至3,142億金管局。香港在首次公開招股籌集資金方面高踞全球第一，連續第二年於19年保持領先地位。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2019年首個5個月上演強大反彈，但其後在該年的其餘時間普遍轉差。由於對美中貿易摩擦的擔憂暫時緩和，市場氣氛在2019年初有所提升，但隨後美中貿易摩擦再次升級、持續社會事件以及國內經濟狀況轉差，氣氛受到打擊。整體而言，房屋價格從5月的高峰期至12月下跌了5%，但由於首個5個月反彈了10%（圖4），仍然錄得5%的年度增長。2019年的交易量較前一年增加4%，達到59,797宗，反映了年初強勁的交易活動。房屋負擔能力仍然偏緊，價收入比和收入按揭比率分別維持在高位，為17.9和80.9，遠高於其長線平均水平。2為協助有即時住房需要的買家，香港按揭證券公司（港按證）在10月調高了符合按揭保險計劃的已落成住宅物業價值上限。3另一方面，非住宅物業市場在2019年面對更強大的下調壓力。特別是，零售物業的價格和租金錄得自2008年全球金融危機以來最大下調，反映了該年營商環境轉差。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n香港於2020年的經濟表現預料將會非常困難，與新冠病毒爆發相關的重大短期下行風險揮之不去。一些行業，例如零售、住宿、食品服務、旅遊和交通，尚未從社會事件造成的擾亂中恢復，將會再次受到打擊。然而，於2020\/21年度預算案中公布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金派發以及SFGS下的新優惠低息貸款，並提供100%政府擔保，預料將為經濟提供一些支持，尤其對家庭和中小企而言。於2020年3月16日，金管局進一步下調銀行逆周期資本緩衝比率，由2.0%降至1.0%，這將讓銀行更能支持本地經濟，特別是那些預料因新冠病毒爆發帶來的影響而經歷額外短期壓力的行業和個人。按GDP組成部分分析，由於脆弱的消費者和企業信心，私人消費和投資可能維持疲弱。雖然政府消費將貢獻經濟增長，但公共投資支出預料將在一些重大基礎設施項目完成後相對放緩。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議被評估對本地經濟在短期內有輕微正面影響。然而，香港的對外貿易表現將繼續受到全球經濟增長和貿易流量疲弱的影響。尤其，新冠病毒爆發可能導致區域供應鏈中斷和跨界經濟活動放緩，例如在旅遊業，從而抑制香港的出口。政府預測2020年實際GDP增長範圍為-1.5%至0.5%，而國際組織和私人分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n通貨膨脹壓力預計在2020年會趨於溫和，原因在於經濟狀況不佳、私人住宅租賃市場整合以及輕微的進口通膨。市場共識預測2020年的整體通膨率為1.8%，而政府則預測整體和基礎通膨率將分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動力市場方面，鑒於經濟前景疲弱和冠狀病毒疫情爆發，失業率在接近未來一段時間內可能進一步上升。私營部門分析師預計2020年的失業率將上升至約4%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年的經濟前景低迷，受到多項不確定性與風險的影響，包括全球經濟放緩、美國與中國貿易關係、中國大陸的經濟表現、本地社會事件以及新冠病毒疫情的持續。特別是，持續的新冠病毒疫情可導致更可見的全球經濟放緩和資產重新定價，而由此導致的不利宏觀經濟環境和更嚴格的金融狀況，將對本地實體經濟活動帶來進一步的壓力。然而，主要中央銀行共同努力放寬貨幣政策，可提供緩衝，以減輕疫情帶來的負面經濟影響。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n儘管全球經濟放緩、美中貿易摩擦和本地社會事件帶來困難的環境，香港銀行業在2019年仍然有韌性。 銀行資產負債表趨勢保持穩定，貸款和存款均溫和增長。 銀行業的資本和流動性狀況仍然穩固，資產品質保持良好。 銀行業繼續錄得盈利，資產平均回報率保持穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

貨幣穩定\n\n香港元兌換率及貨幣市場於2019年運作暢順且有序。香港元兌換率全年仍然穩定，並在年底接近兌換範圍的強大範圍內得到加強。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，掛鈎匯率制度一次又一次地見證了其對衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港的貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在與美元的外匯市場中保持穩定的外部匯價，區間為每1美元兌7.75至7.85金管局。貨幣制度的結構以聯繫匯率制度為特色，要求貨幣基礎最少由持於外匯基金的美元儲備以100%支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全匹配。\n\n貨幣基礎 (表 1) 包括：\n\n債務憑證，為發行銀行發行的三種紙幣提供十足的支持。\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣在流通中的總額，即銀行於金管局持有的結算戶餘額的合共。\n\n由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及儲蓄券。\n\n透過自動利率調整機制，以及金管局履行可兌換承諾（CUs）的堅定承諾，維持了港元的穩定。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率轉強至強方可兌換承諾（7.75港元兌1美元），金管局準備好根據要求向銀行出售港元以換取美元。其後，結餘將擴展以壓低港元利率，從而營造貨幣條件，使港元從強方上限回復至兌換範圍的7.75至7.85。反之，如果港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率疲弱至弱方可兌換承諾（7.85港元兌1美元），金管局準備好根據要求向銀行買入港元。其後，結餘將收縮以推高港元利率，推動港元從弱方上限保持在兌換範圍內。\n\n# 檢討 2019\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，且國內經濟增長放緩，港元在2019年仍然保持穩定，並在整體上以暢順和有序的方式交易。在年初，負的港元兌美元息差吸引了沽出港元以換取美元的套利交易活動，推動港元匯率接近疲弱範圍內的7.85（圖1）。隨著港元匯率的轉弱持續，疲弱範圍內在3月被觸發八次。其後，港元繼續維持在疲弱範圍內的7.85匯率附近。自5月接近年底以來，大量首次公開招股集資活動帶來的強大港元需求、企業股息支付需求以及年底結算，帶動港元加強。儘管港元在年中標誌過後一度下跌，但從10月接近年底開始重新獲得勢頭，並保持在兌換範圍的強大範圍內。這反映了部分與股權相關的需求，包括首次公開招股，以及部分由於年底接近時的流動性收緊而導致的平倉港元空頭頭寸。總體而言，港元外匯市場在2019年全年正常運作。\n\n由於觸發疲弱範圍內的兌換保證，總結餘（撇除再貼現窗口）及未償還的銀行票據總額由2018年底的11,362億金管局港元下跌至2019年底的11,330億金管局港元（圖2）。在該年內，金管局根據掛鈎匯率制度的設計，根據銀行要求，以疲弱範圍內的7.85兌換保證，購入總額為221億金管局港元的貨幣，導致總結餘（撇除再貼現窗口）由2018年底的764億金管局港元減少至2019年底的543億金管局港元。未償還的銀行票據在該年內輕微增加，由1,059.8億金管局港元增加至10,787億金管局港元，反映了根據已設立慣例發行銀行票據以吸納銀行票據的利息支付。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足支持外匯儲備。總結餘（撇除再貼現窗口）及未償還的結匯基金票據和債券在2019年底為1,1330億金管局港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n於2019年，香港銀行同業拆息的較長期利率仍然大致穩定，而短期利率大致上升（圖3）。短期利率亦經歷更多波動，帶動因素為新股集資相關的資金需求和季節性的資金需要。自2018年4月以來，結餘減少或已帶來香港銀行同業拆息對本地市場港幣資金供需變動的更高敏感度。\n\n基準利率於8月1日、19日和31日共下調75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至11月初的2.00%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率的目標區間在當年內三次下調，總計75個基點，從2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。在11月18日至26日和12月19日至31日，基準利率被設立為高於2.00%，反映了過去兩個月一夜之間和一個月期香港銀行同業拆息（HIBORs）顯著上升的趨勢。因此，基準利率在2019年底收報2.49%。基準利率的調整是根據2009年3月26日公布的修訂公式，該公式將基準利率設定為美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限以上或5個移動平均數的平均值，以較高者為準。在零售方面，多家零售銀行在10月接近年底美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下降後，將其最佳貸款利率調低了12.5個基點。\n\n港元遠期點數在首個兩個月擴闊，大致追隨港元兌美元息差的變化，2月中的12日港元遠期點數達至約負708點子（圖4）。其後，隨著負港元兌美元息差的縮窄，港元遠期點數的折扣逐步收窄，並在年底轉為保費。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場運作保持有序。於2019年，再貼現窗口借款減少至383億港元，較2018年的402億港元為低。\n\n# 掛鈎匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度在過去數十年內為香港的貨幣及金融穩定貢獻了大幅力量，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現其韌性。在今年發生社會事件的背景下，大量無根據的謠言在社交媒體上流通，對聯匯制度和香港的金融穩定產生懷疑。金管局果斷且積極地駁斥這些謠言，並透過傳統媒體和社交媒體釋除公眾疑慮，重申聯匯制度將維持，香港不會實行外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局發布了數目文章，幫助公眾了解聯匯制度的運作、資金流向以及利率前景。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯匯制度的信心，正如全年市場的有序運作所反映。政府亦穩固地支持聯匯制度。外匯和貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了公眾對政府承諾以及使用港元作為支付方式和保值的信心。在2019年第四條諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織再次肯定了聯匯制度作為香港金融穩定基石的一向支持，並評論聯匯制度仍然是香港適當的匯率安排，其背後有香港透明的規則、充足的財政及外匯儲備、強大的金融監管和監督、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架支持。\n\n一個穩健的銀行體系對於 LERS 的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系具有高度流動性且穩健，流動性狀況和資本充裕程度均遠高於最低國際標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，金管局一直緊密監察銀行信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試的結果，並繼續加強對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管努力。與上一年的總結餘相比，銀行普遍加強了流動性管理安排，並在管理日常資金狀況方面更加積極。此外，金管局一直與銀行保持緊密對話，以確保市場上流動性的良好回收，尤其是在大型首次公開招股的認購期之前和期間。今年並未見到任何結算堵塞的情況，貼現窗口繼續有效且有效率地運作。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局賬戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已分配一部分外匯基金資產為貨幣基礎提供支持。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2019年內變動於109.9—112.1%的範圍內，而未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收報111.2%（圖5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然已指定部分外匯基金資產用於支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可支持港元匯率。倘出現突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源，一同與香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強有力的支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）轄下的外匯基金諮詢委員會監察及檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的發出事項。於2019年，貨幣發行委員會考慮了包括一份關於即時結算系統營運的事件研究、總結餘與香港利率之間的關係、對期權市場關於即時結算系統的看法採取更提升及靈活的做法，以及未來首次公開招股對HIBOR的影響等發出事項。貨幣發行委員會就這些發出事項的討論錄得，以及提交予貨幣發行委員會的貨幣板營運報告均會刊登於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融貨幣研究 Institute (HKIMR)，前身為香港貨幣研究 Institute，致力於貨幣政策、銀行和金融等主題的研究，這些研究對政策具有相關性。這體現在HKIMR研究人員和海外訪問學者探討的廣泛主題，以及其舉辦的會議和活動。HKIMR 與重大中央銀行和政策機構合作聯合舉辦以政策為中心的會議。其研究訪問計劃支持有關香港金管局、香港和區內重要的政策發出項目。\n\n在2019年，香港金融研究所舉辦了14位學者，刊登了17份工作論文，並舉辦了11場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣和金融發出。 亦舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n第十屆國際中華經濟會議，題為「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」，於1月10日至11日在香港舉辦，由香港金融管理局研究院、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合舉辦。本次會議為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業界的經濟專家提供了一個全球一流的論壇，以討論與中國內地金融業面對的風險相關發出，因應金融改革及中國內地經濟發展引入的變革。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new

業界已採納措施，確保對公眾造成的 불편大程度降至最低。 在該年，金管局將監管重點放在認可機構的信貸和流動性風險管理上。 根據不斷升級的網絡威脅以及業界對科技日益增長的依賴，金管局加強了對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。 在進行監管方面，金管局精簡了投資者保護措施，以提升客戶經驗，同時確保客戶的保護。 我們亦提升了數碼金融服務的消費者保護，並繼續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動專案組對香港反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資制度的第4季互認評估的結果，該評估被評估為整體合規且有效，並特別獲得正面肯定，尤其是在銀行業對風險的良好了解以及金管局在反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資領域的根據風險的監管工作方面。金管局繼續參與公共私營合作夥伴關係，以分享有關訛騙和洗錢的智能（人工智能），並積極支持銀行業採用反洗錢\/打擊恐怖主義融資監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，金管局於2019年批出（牌照）8間虛擬銀行，並公布三個階段的策略以促進香港綠色及可持續銀行業的發展。金管局與銀行業界保持緊密合作，以優化監管政策和流程，並開展能力建設措施，促進人才的培養。\n\n與此同時，在國際審慎監管標準的本地落實方面取得了顯著進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險敞口標準。金管局亦繼續其工作，以確保將為認可機構建立一個可信的決議機制，包括實施有關損失吸收能力要求的規則，以提升認可機構的處置可行性。\n\n# 目的\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是推動銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。達成此目標取決於金融體系高度有韌性，並且能夠提供香港經濟需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其企業的經營方式，以及在極端情況下以不整頓的方式倒閉，可能影響系統的穩定性。貨幣當局作為監察當局，發揮關鍵作用，透過確保銀行對衝擊有韌性，並能在危機時恢復其地位，以回應危機，最終有助於防止破產，從而保障金融穩定。貨幣當局負責香港銀行的審慎監理。其職責是授權在香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。貨幣當局亦負責指定和監察某些金融市場基礎設施。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法確保，香港的審慎監管框架亦非設計用以確保零風險的金融體系。相反，貨幣當局作為解決機構，致力於確保在認可機構出現不可行之時，其破產可以以有序方式管理。為此，香港已為金融機構設立解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局是認可機構的解決當局。為確保香港的解決機制能夠運作，制定解決法規和政策標準、進行解決規劃以移除認可機構的處置可行性障礙，以及制定金管局解決陷入困境認可機構的運營能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些任務，金管局採取了國際協調一致的方法。\n\n# 檢討 2019\n\n# 監察活動概覽\n\n於2019年，進行了196項非現場覆核，涵蓋了廣泛的發出問題，包括CAMEL評級評估、公司治理、風險管理和金融科技策略。作為香港金融管理局繼續努力推動更強風險治理的其中一部分，與認可機構的董事會或董事級委員會舉辦了26日會議。此外，香港金融管理局、認可機構及其外部審計師之間舉辦了32項三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動，香港金融管理局進行定期現場檢查，並輔以對評估為更高風險的範疇進行主題審查。本年共進行了405次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一重大重點在於科技風險和營運風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及落實巴塞爾資本充足率框架的現場檢查和主題審查數目。與此同時，專業團隊表現了對人工智能在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金相關企業的活動進行現場檢查和主題審查。\n\n表 1 載有香港金融管理局於2019年的監管活動的整體概要。\n\n# 信用風險監管\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n銀行貸款在2019年溫和增加。總貸款增長了6.7%，相比2018年的4.4%。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款和用於香港以外的貸款分別增長了7.7%和5.8%。\n\n與內地相關貸款於2019年底增長了7.4%，達到金管局4,564億港元（表3）。\n\n人工智能資產品質仍然良好。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2018年底的0.51% 輕微下降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2%。就整體銀行業而言，不良貸款比率從0.55% 輕微增加至0.57%。具體而言，在與大陸相關的貸款方面，零售銀行不良貸款比率從2018年的0.63% 增加至2019年的0.79%，但仍處於歷史低位。就整體銀行業而言，該比率從一年前的0.55% 增加至75%。\n\n在該年，金管局投入了增加的監管努力，確保認可金融機構繼續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準，在不確定的經濟環境之下。壓力測試已加強，以納入更全面的風險覆蓋範圍和更嚴重的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果繼續顯示，銀行普遍擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以抵禦極為衝擊。針對性和主題性的檢查已進行，以評估認可金融機構在不同範疇的信貸風險管理實務，例如向從事高風險業務的企業、複雜融資安排以及為私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的抵押貸款。鑑於中小企可能在經濟衰退期間面對更大挑戰，金管局於10月設立了銀行業中小企貸款協調機制，期望鼓勵銀行在符合審慎風險管理原則的範圍內，繼續支持中小企的融資需要。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n香港銀行界抵禦房地產市場逆轉的能力，自2009年以來，已因香港金融管理局引入的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施而大幅加強。新的住宅按揭貸款平均貸款與價值比率（LTV）由2009年9月的64%下降至2019年12月的53%，在首次引入逆周期措施之前。新的按揭貸款平均供款與入息比率（DSR）亦從2010年8月的41%下降至2019年12月的36%，當時首次應用供款與入息比率（DSR）上限（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險之監控\n\n香港金融管理局採用三個階段的方法來實施網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）下的網絡韌性評估框架。第一階段評估，涵蓋所有重大銀行，已於2018年落成。其餘涵蓋第二和三分之一階段的評估，已按計劃實質性完成。鑒於過去幾年所獲得的經驗，香港金融管理局亦開展了對CFI的全面檢討，以完善該計劃。\n\n10月，香港金融管理局刊登了《監管政策手冊》（SpM）中關於「電子銀行風險管理」的修訂章節。這次修訂旨在提供業界更大靈活性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務不斷變化的期望。香港金融管理局亦設立了一系列高層原則，以指引業界使用人工（智能）。\n\n自6月社會事件開始以來，金管局一直與業界保持緊密對話，以監察對銀行營運及服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM），並盡快維修被破壞的設施。金管局亦迅速行動反駁惡意謠言，這些謠言試圖破壞公眾對銀行體系的信心。 感謝銀行業界共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施很快恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的困擾亦維持在最低程度。 鑒於社會事件帶來的上升營運風險，銀行被要求選持倉盤額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險管理之監督\n\n在該年內，進行了一輪主題審查，以評估金融機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。 這些審查著重於金融機構流動性壓力測試計劃的穩健性，以及其應急資金管理。 金管局亦評估金融機構在流動性覆蓋率（LCR）計算方面的法規遵循情況，以確保所運用計算輸入的審慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著演算法交易在銀行業日益普及，香港金融管理局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估人工智能在該領域的風險管理實務。 鑒於倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）可能在2021年底停止刊登，香港金融管理局提醒人工智能為過渡至另類參考利率做好準備，並進行了一項調查以監察它們的過渡準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子融資 (ML\/TF)\n\n香港金管局根據風險進行人工智能反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資系統的監管。在過去一年，進行了18次現場檢查和61次非現場檢討，包括針對私人銀行以及新技術使用的治理主題檢討。香港金管局與業界分享了從中小企風險為基礎的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制應用主題檢討中備受矚目的觀察結果和最佳實務，以協助人工智能採用適當的開戶流程和為中小企提供服務。\n\n# 金融行動特別工作組（FATF）互認評估（ME）香港報告\n\n2019 年香港金融管理局及香港整體反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資制度的一大亮點，是金融行動專案組（FATF）於 9月發佈的香港相互評估報告。該報告代表了 FATF 第四輪相互評估中，其成員司法管轄區迄今為止的最佳整體成果。香港在評估其反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資制度的成效時，在 11 個「即時結果」中獲得六個「實質」評級，並且在相互評估的技術合規方面獲得高標誌。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局以風險為基礎的反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資監管方法作出了良好評估，並指出香港金融管理局對銀行業的洗錢及恐怖主義融資風險有良好了解，對儲值設施（SVF）行業的風險亦有合理了解。報告亦肯定了銀行業在反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資方面的共同努力，例如較大的智能（人工智能）增加使用數據分析，大部分可疑交易報告是由智能（人工智能）提交，以及該行業積極參與打擊訛騙及洗錢智能（人工智能）專案組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議多項範疇的改善，包括對一些更高風險範疇的了解，例如海外貪腐和逃稅犯罪，以及培育中的領域如SVF。工作已經開始應對這些建議；香港金融管理局於七月刊登了修訂後的洗錢／恐怖融資風險評估報告，並開始對私人銀行以及新科技使用的管治進行主題式實地檢查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The MoU is signed between Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, Ms Haster Tang (second from left), and Deputy Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC and Director of the Shenzhen Fintech Institute, Mr Di Gang (second from right).\n\nOn artificial intelligence (AI), the HKMA carried out a study on the application of AI technology in the Hong Kong banking industry. Key findings of an industry-wide AI survey were published in November, followed by the issuance of the full report, titled “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence”, in December.\n\nThe report “Reshaping Banking with Artificial Intelligence” is published in December.\n\nA fact sheet is published to highlight the key facts and figures derived from a survey on the use of AI in the Hong Kong banking industry.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. Over 220 students benefited from the programme last

國際金融中心\n\n香港是一個世界各地具有競爭力的國際金融中心。智慧銀行措施的落實已取得良好進展，以進一步制定香港成為金融科技樞紐。藉著利用來自內地金融市場開放所帶來的機遇，已作出大量進展以推動粵港澳大灣區的金融合作，尤其是在便利香港居民於該區域跨境使用金融和銀行服務方面。\n\n與此同時，大量努力已作出以開放新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基礎設施投資和融資、綠色金融和私募股權基金。香港金融學院已設立，以可持續的方式加強香港的軟實力。\n\n在中央銀行和監管界別，金管局在多個區域和國際委員會發揮領導作用，這充分肯定了香港在國際工作方面的專業知識和承諾。\n\n# 概述\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位，金管局投入巨大努力實施於2017年9月公布的七項「智慧銀行」倡議，旨在促進金融科技在銀行和支付行業的發展和應用。本年這些倡議的主要進展包括：\n\n擴大普及轉數快 (FpS)；\n促進銀行界落實開放應用程式介面 (ApI) 框架的第二階段 (II) 及第一階段；\n進一步提升金融科技研究和人才 (talent) 發展；\n加強金融科技跨境合作；授予八個虛擬銀行牌照；\n促進業界增加使用金融科技監管沙盒 (FSS) 2.0，以推出 (launching) 金融科技舉措；以及\n進一步促進透過「銀行服務更容易」 (Banking Made Easy) 計劃採用監管科技 (Regtech)。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）一同與香港金融管理局銀行部門發揮關鍵作用，推動這些措施的落實。\n\n香港在全球範圍內發揮不可或缺的作用，促進國際投資者配置人民幣資產，憑藉滬港通和債券通計劃，擁有無與倫比的內地市場準入渠道。 過去一年，債券通註冊投資者數目增長兩倍，每日成交額亦可見一斑。 債券通和滬港通進一步引入了多項優化措施，為國際投資者投資內地證券提供更多便利和靈活性。 香港金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探索和實施一系列金融便利措施，方便香港居民在粵港澳大灣區全方位地獲取金融和銀行服務，包括具前景的兩方式財富管理互聯互通計劃。 香港保持堅定不移的立足點，作為離岸人民幣業務的全球中心。 根據國際清算銀行（BIS）三年一次的《外匯及衍生品市場成交額調查》，香港繼續是全球最大的人民幣離岸外匯中心。\n\n持續的努力投入於開拓新機遇，以進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力。為推動香港基金業務的制定，香港金融管理局與政府和業界緊密合作，提供更利好的稅務和監管環境以供基金成立。舉辦了數目眾多的盛大規模活動和針對性的宣傳活動，以推動香港成為綠色金融、基礎設施投資和融資以及企業資金中心（CTCs）的樞紐。為提升香港的軟實力，金融學院（Academy of Finance）（AoF）於6月設立，以制定金融領導力並推動研究合作。\n\n在中央銀行和監管界別，香港金融管理局在數目眾多的區域性和國際委員會中發揮領導作用。香港金融管理局至2019年8月31日主持金融穩定委員會（FSB）的監理合作常設委員會（SRC）。現時，香港金融管理局正主持巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）的監理與落實小組（SIG），以及在東亞及太平洋區中央銀行高級管理人員會議（EMEAP）下設立的工作小組（WGFM）。香港金融管理局亦與美國證券交易委員會共同主持金融穩定委員會的非銀行監察專家小組（NMEG）。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的運作安全且高效，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定了穩固的根基。四個銀行間即時總額結算系統、中央結算及交收系統 (CMU) 以及香港儲存庫 (HKTR) 在2019年均取得100%的系統可用性，超越了99.95%的目標。透過與兩家內地中央證券登記結算機構設立的賬戶，中央結算及交收系統協助了「債券通」北向交易的結算，以及代表相關中央結算及交收系統會員持有內地債務證券。\n\n轉數快，作為香港元即時支付系統的延伸，使公眾能夠制定即時零售資金轉帳和付款，全不同銀行和儲值設施（SVF）全天候運作，在其首個年運作情況順利。用戶對此設施的採用持續增加，體現在年底的四百萬登記數目和交易量增長兩倍。轉數快為零售支付行業帶來新機遇，並推動金融科技創新。\n\n為確保本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，金管局已指定並監察《支付系統及儲值設施條例》（PSSVFO）下的六個零售支付系統（RPS）。金管局亦於5月發出兩張新的儲值設施牌照，使儲值設施牌照持有人的數目增至18。儲值設施牌照持牌人於該年繼續推出新產品及服務，積極多元化客戶選擇，並提升使用者經驗。\n\n# 檢討 2019\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行舉措\n\n七項「智慧銀行」倡議於2017年9月由金管局公布，旨在協助銀行業取得更高運作標準，並擁抱銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。在該年，在實施這些倡議和轉型香港金融科技生態系統方面，作出大量進展。\n\n# 更快付款系統\n\n於2018年9月推出之轉數快，是香港金融基礎設施發展的一個重大里程碑，標誌著數碼時代的來臨。轉數快進一步推動香港市民及企業採用電子支付，提供高效及方便的支付服務。自轉數快推出以來，參與服務供應商的數目已增加至30間銀行及11個SVF，至2019年底，再增加九間銀行及一個SVF。\n\n轉數快 的用量亦持續增長。截至2019年12月31日，轉數快 記錄了四百萬登記數目（圖1），並處理了44百萬筆交易，涉及總額為金管局7485億港元及人民幣17億元。2019年12月，平均每日成交額達到168,000筆交易，價值金管局24億港元及人民幣3800萬港元（圖2），相比之下，在2018年10月首個每月 的運作期間為51,000筆交易。\n\n更快支付系統記錄：\n- 截至2019年12月31日，登記數目為4百萬\n- 截至2019年12月31日，交易數目為44百萬\n- 2019年12月的平均每日成交額為金管局24億港元及人民幣3800萬\n\n香港金融管理局與業界合作，將轉數快用量由個人對個人支付擴展至法案支付及其他商戶支付。例如，已作出改善，使商戶可利用不同代理識別碼，並透過二維碼接受部分或超額付款。一份技術守則已制定，以促進從商業應用程式調用手機銀行或SVF電子錢包應用程式（app）進行轉數快支付。這將大大改善顧客利用手機裝置透過轉數快進行商戶及企業付款的經驗。\n\n香港金融管理局亦緊密與相關政府部門合作，協助他們利用轉數快接受公眾繳付法案。由11月1日起，稅務局、評估及物業估價署和水務署發出的法案均印有轉數快二維碼，以便公眾可容易地使用支持的流動銀行或SVF電子錢包應用程式繳費。香港金融管理局將繼續與各項政府部門和公營機構合作，探索其他潛在應用情況，以制定方便公眾透過轉數快繳費的方案。\n\n為提高公眾對轉數快 的認識，金管局發展了一系列新 的教育及宣傳材料，例如在電視及電台播放的公眾利益廣播片，以及在數碼平台發佈的影片和電子橫額。金管局亦參與貿易展覽，向中小企 及企業推動轉數快。各項參與轉數快 的銀行和支付系統營運商推出推廣宣傳活動，並提供誘因鼓勵客戶紀錄冊 與轉數快，並用其進行資金轉移和法案付款。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局委聘了數目不少的業界組織和機構，提供有關轉數快的功能介紹，以及它可能為不同企業在收款和付款方面帶來的潛在福利。\n\n政府已採用轉數快為稅款、差餉及政府地租和水費繳費。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n香港金融管理局繼續促進銀行界發展及採用開放API，根據開放API框架的四階段方法。在第一階段，20間零售銀行於1月開放了超過500個開放API端點，涵蓋銀行產品及服務的資訊。在第二階段，銀行於10月開放了超過300個API，以支持銀行產品及服務的應用。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n在貿易融資方面，將eTradeConnect與we.trade連接的試驗研究已於本年度首個季度落成。11月，香港銀行同業結算有限公司的子公司與中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所簽署《諒解備忘錄》，以進行將eTradeConnect與中國人民銀行貿易融資平台連接的試驗研究，為香港和中國內地企業提供更方便的貿易融資服務。\n\n在中央銀行數字貨幣（CBDC）方面，香港金融管理局與泰國銀行開展了一項名為 Inthanon-LionRock 項目，以研究 CBDC 在跨境支付中的應用，期望促進香港和泰國銀行間的港幣兌泰銖（pvp）交易。\n\n香港金融管理局金融基礎設施總監鮑 Colin

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場在2019年表現更好於預期，主要央行寬鬆的貨幣政策帶來的效果大於對全球經濟增長放緩和我們-中國貿易摩擦的擔憂。全球股市在2018年第4季的重大調整後反彈，而主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格則上漲。在這樣利好的環境下，外匯基金在2019年記錄了2,622億金管局元的投資收入，相當於6.6%的投資回報率。\n\n# 結匯基金\n\n交換基金的首要目標，如《交換基金條例》所制定，是影響香港貨幣的匯價，或直接或間接方式進行。基金亦可運用以維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全，以幫助維持香港作為國際金融中心。金管局在財政司司長（財司）的授權下，並在轉授的條款內，負責交換基金的運用和投資管理，並向財司負責。\n\n# 結匯基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已設立外匯基金的隨着投資目標：\n\n(a) 以保本為目標；\n(b) 確保整個貨幣基礎，在任何時候，都得到高度流動性美元計價資產的十足支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性可供維持貨幣及金融穩定之用；以及\n(d) 在符合(a)–(c)的前提下，取得投資回報，以幫助保本並維持基金的長線購買實力。\n\n這些目標十足考慮了結匯基金的法定宗旨，並已註冊於投資組合結構及基金的目標資產配置之中。\n\n大致上來說，外匯基金持有兩項重大投資組合：支持投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP持有高度流動性的美元計價資產，以提供十足的支持給貨幣板安排下所規定的貨幣基礎。IP主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股權市場，以保本其資產的價值和長線購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險並提升中長線的回報，金管局以審慎及漸進的方式分散一部分外匯基金的投資至更廣的不同資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股權、私募股權（包括基礎設施）和房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股權投資於投資組合中持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則於長線增長投資組合（LTGP）中設立。LTGP投資市值上限為外匯基金累積盈餘的三分之一以及與LTGP掛鈎的未來基金和外匯基金附屬機構的投資總和。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年設立，持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份由政府為外匯基金的策略性目的而購得。由於其獨特性質，此投資組合並未包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 與外匯基金的職位\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率一般與投資組合表現掛鈎，但未來基金為重大例外，其利率則同時參考投資組合配置，與投資組合及長期增值基金掛鈎。截至2019年底，未來基金投資組合中投資組合及長期增值基金的配置比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n交易所基金的投資過程以兩類資產配置的決定為支持：策略性資產配置和戰略性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表鑒於交易所基金的投資目標所作出的長線資產配置。以策略性配置作指引，資產會被戰略性分配，以爭取超越基準的超額回報。這表示實際配置往往不同於基準（或策略性）配置。實際配置與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。基準和追蹤錯誤上限由金管局與基金諮詢委員會共同決定，而戰略性決定以及戰略性偏離的允許範圍則由金管局在授權的當局下作出並設立。在允許的戰略性偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可以選持倉盤，以獲利於短期市場變化。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局於8月2018年設立外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以集中其投資及相關風險管理職能。外匯基金投資辦公室的會員直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括整個BP及部分IP。IP的這部分包括投資於全球定息市場的一系列投資組合，以及各項實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n此外管理內部資產，香港金融管理局聘請外部基金經理管理約29日交易所基金資產的百分之二十九，包括其所有上市股權投資組合和其他專門資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的，是汲取市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續回報，汲取多元且互補的投資風格，並爭取他們對市場的洞察力及投資的技術專長。\n\n與使用外部經理人相關的支出包括基金管理和託管費用、交易成本，以及預扣和其他稅款。這筆支出主要由市場因素決定，並且可能每年波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規性\n\n投資環境的增長複雜度強調了風險管理的重要性。嚴格的控制和投資指引已制定於內部和外部管理的投資組合，並且對遵守指引和法規的情況進行緊密監察。隨著投資環境成為更複雜，風險評估已加強以支持外匯基金增加的投資多元化程度。風險控制工具被部署以評估在正常和不利市場條件下的市場風險。詳細的績效歸因分析亦進行以物色績效來源，支持金管局評估如何制定最佳運用內部和外部經理的技巧。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任投資（RI），將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素併入交易所基金的公共及私人市場投資流程中。\n\n就公開市場投資而言，金管局實施了流程相關及投資相關的措施。金管局採納的一項流程相關措施是採用證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年發佈的《責任投資原則》（PRO），這有助於投資者決定如何最佳滿足其與其在香港上市公司的投資相關的責任。在管理外匯基金方面，金管局已制定內部指引，涵蓋外部基金經理的甄選、委任和監察流程，以評估環境、社會及管治因素。獲委任管理金管局香港股票及內地主動股票投資組合的外部基金經理規定恪守《責任投資原則》，並以「遵守或解釋」的方式管理投資；而獲委任管理金管局於發達市場股票投資組合的外部基金經理則需要恪守國際公認的環境、社會及管治標準。除了外部管理的基金外，環境、社會及管治因素亦已註冊到金管局內部管理的債券投資的信用風險分析中。\n\n至於公共市場的環境、社會及管治投資，香港金融管理局早於2015年便已投資於綠色債券，成為該市場最早的投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司主導、重點關注新興市場可持續投資的共同貸款投資組合計劃。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續增長其綠色債券投資組合，或直接投資，或投資於綠色債券基金。香港金融管理局亦計劃在股權投資中構建以ESG為主題的授權，採納環境、社會及管治股權指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並聘用將環境、社會及管治因素應用於其投資決定的主動股權經理。\n\n就私募市場投資方面而言，金管局在盡職審查過程中檢視普通合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策和實務。特別是，環境、社會及管治風險評估是所有長遠策略投資組合投資的強制性盡職審查部分。對於長遠策略投資組合，金管局投資具有可持續發展特點的項目；例如，自2013年起，金管局已直接及共同投資能源行業的可再生能源，以及其房地產投資組合中的綠色建築和具有綠色及可持續發展特點的倉庫。展望未來，金管局將繼續尋找具有可持續發展特點的項目，並將綠色認證納入房地產投資的重要因素。\n\n香港金融管理局將緊密監察環境、社會及管治標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入其投資流程。此流程得益於其與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織的合作。特別是，作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則的簽署方，而該原則是全球領先的責任投資倡議平台，香港金融管理局預期將參與環境、社會及管治最佳實務的制定，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦是FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織是一個非牟利機構，透過研討會和研究，鼓勵企業和投資決策著重長遠發展。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作小組的支持者。\n\n如欲了解更多關於金管局RI政策框架的細則，請參閱《企業社會責任》章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管對全球經濟增長放緩和我們-中國貿易摩擦的擔憂，全球金融市場在2019年表現良好，得益於主要中央銀行的寬鬆貨幣政策的支持。隨着2018年第4季的重大調整，全球股市在2019年反彈。在債券市場，主要政府債券收益率顯著下跌，而債券價格在2019年的首個三季度上漲，這是貨幣寬鬆的結果。儘管債券價格在第4季回落，收益率略為反彈，但2019年債券市場的整體收益仍然令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場中，重大貨幣對美元的表現各異。在較早前的第三季度，由於美中貿易摩擦升溫，人民幣下跌了 3.8%，但在第四季度鑒於貿易摩擦緩和，人民幣反彈了部分之前的損失。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了 1.4%。雖然英鎊在第三季度因脫歐無協議的風險增加而下跌了 3.2%，但自此大幅反彈，隨著第四季度脫歐情況明朗化，最終增強了 4.0% 的美元價值。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現見表1。\n\n# 匯風盈餘基金的表現\n\n外匯基金於2019年記錄了2,622億港元的投資收益。這包括1,145億港元的債券收益、221億港元的香港股票收益、1,007億港元的其他股票收益、非港元資產的負130億港元貨幣換算影響，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益379億港元。另一方面，策略組合記錄了2.5%的估值收益。\n\n於年年底，外匯基金總資產達到金管局4,206.7億港元。長期投資策略下的投資市值總計為金管局335.1億港元，其中私募股權為金管局233.4億港元，房地產為1,017億港元。未償投資承諾達到金管局219.3億港元。\n\n於2019年，交易所基金的投資回報率（不包括策略投資組合）為6.6%。具體而言，IP取得9.7%的回報率，而Bp則增長了2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部收益率記錄為12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005. Resources have been redeployed to undertake the following new tasks:\n\n# Banking and Financial Stability\n- Develop and implement a supervisory regime for virtual banks and cope with the increasingly complex prudential supervision standards\n- Enhance supervisory capacity for the new regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries\n- Step up ongoing monitoring of banks’ culture reform, and conduct ongoing supervision of banks and other relevant entities providing trust services\n\n# Reserves Management\n- Strengthen investment and risk management and other necessary support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities\n\n# Hong Kong as an International Financial Centre\n- Support reforms that enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s tax regime regarding different financial services sectors\n- Enhance the daily qualitative market surveillance and analyses of Trade Repository data\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. the cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay that may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the eFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time to reward individual meritorious staff members and to maintain the competitiveness of their pay.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

內 部，各項努力作出 改善香港金融管理局的公司管治，包括支持員工的專業發展、訂立嚴格的財務紀律、提升資訊科技安全，以及推動創新文化，以應對來自新措施落實和工作複雜度增加所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 聘用社群\n\n# 媒體關係與社群媒體\n\n香港金融管理局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度，並推動公眾對其政策和工作 的了解。在過去一年，舉辦了125場開放傳媒活動，包括10場會議、12日即場訪問及103個其他公開活動。另有25次媒體訪問安排。共發布了466份雙語新聞稿，並且每日處理大量查詢。\n\n為提高公眾對金管局主要職能的認識，金管局舉辦了媒體簡報會和教育研討會，邀請本地及海外媒體，以及社區主要意見領袖參與，以促進對廣泛主題的了解，例如聯系匯率制度、虛擬銀行、綠色金融，以及香港作為一個具競爭力的國際金融中心。\n\n自2018年7月以來，香港金融管理局已推出各項社交媒體渠道以加強公眾教育和溝通。現時共有5個社交媒體渠道正在營運：Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter和YouTube，截至2019年12月底，共觸及超過45,000名用戶。在2019年下半年發生的各種事件之下，香港金融管理局利用社交媒體反駁有關銀行營運和金融穩定的不實謠言，此舉證明在傳播事實和防止謠言進一步散播方面，效果高度顯著。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n香港金管局公共查詢服務提供了一個有效的方式，讓公眾更好了解金管局的主要職能和營運。2019年共處理了9,742個查詢，其中約一半與銀行政策及規例、個人銀行服務，以及紙幣和硬幣相關。一些顯著的查詢是關於紀念硬幣收藏計劃、銀行產品及服務、銀行相關指引及通函、轉數快 (FPS)，以及貨幣和經濟統計。\n\n圖 1 顯示自 2016年 接獲的公眾查詢數目，而圖 2 提供 2019 年按查詢性質的分類。\n\n香港金融管理局執行長余偉文先生於香港銀行公會傑出演講者午宴上發言。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁葉文傑（左）與當時的香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德霖，在公布葉文傑先生為香港金融管理局之後行政總裁時與媒體會面。\n\n#

{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged. The HKMA also sponsors a professional counselling service comprising experienced psychologists and social workers.\n\nThroughout the year, different activities are organised to enhance the staff’s physical wellness, promote their sense of belonging, and foster co-operation and team spirit. Interest classes are held for staff members and their families. Inter-organisational and cross-divisional activities such as basketball and football competitions with fellow regulators provide opportunities to socialise.\n","terms":{"achievements":["成果"],"strengthened":["加強"],"enhanced":["加強"],"need":["需要"],"COVID-19":["新型冠狀病毒"],"cast":["造成"],"merchants":["商戶"],"established":["設立"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"corporates":["企業"],"must":["必須"],"work":["工作"],"historical":["歷史"],"orderly":["有序"],"world":["全球"],"15":["15"],"enhance":["提升"],"areas":["範疇"],"span":["短短"],"economy":["經濟"],"sight":["忽略"],"people":["市民"],"rest":["其餘"],"800,000":["80萬"],"June":["6月"],"including":["包括"],"’":["’"],"facing":["面對"],"borrowers":["借款人"],"half":["一半"],"anything":["跌宕起伏"],"2009":["2009年"],"environmentfriendly":["具環保意識"],"happen":["發生"],"November":["11月"],"granular":["細緻"],"800":["800"],"provide":["提供"],"record":["紀錄"],"make":["制定"],"support":["支持"],"new":["新"],"applied":["應用"],"year":["年"],"evolving":["變化"],"applying":["應用"],"face":["面對"],"launch":["推出"],"principle":["原則"],"phases":["階段"],"According":["根據"],"thereby":["從而"],"stable":["穩定"],"achieve":["取得"],"economies":["經濟體"],"foot":["步伐"],"greatly":["大大"],"billion":["億"],"almost":["接近"],"particularly":["特別"],"fulfil":["履行"],"society":["社會"],"providing":["提供"],"put":["投入"],"rumours":["謠言"],"bearing":["顯著"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"doubt":["懷疑"],"Apart":["除了"],"set":["設立"],"major":["重大"],"rounds":["輪"],"operation":["運作"],"also":["亦"],"regard":["顧及"],"hard":["困難"],"promoting":["推動"],"1.0":["1.0%"],"addressing":["應對"],"would":["將"],"applications":["應用"],"like":["例如"],"sound":["穩健"],"talks":["研討會"],"weather":["抵禦"],"years":["年"],"experienced":["經歷"],"2014":["2014年"],"journey":["旅程"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"broader":["更廣"],"eight":["8"],"sharing":["分享"],"paving":["鋪路"],"latter":["下半年"],"efficiency":["效率"],"cross-banks":["跨行"],"release":["釋放"],"perspective":["角度"],"2.8":["2.8%"],"calm":["冷靜"],"advances":["推進"],"specific":["具體"],"since":["自"],"accessing":["使用"],"opportunity":["機會"],"begun":["開始"],"anchor":["基石"],"step":["步驟"],"uncertainty":["不確定性"],"complemented":["輔以"],"nutshell":["簡單而言"],"address":["應對"],"dedication":["全力"],"worst":["最大"],"fears":["憂慮"],"tensions":["摩擦"],"1983":["1983年"],"activity":["活動"],"fruit":["成效"],"capabilities":["能力"],"SMEs":["中小企"],"discuss":["討論"],"functioning":["運作"],"monitor":["監察"],"challenging":["困難"],"150":["150"],"strengthening":["加強"],"launched":["推出"],"completing":["完成"],"–":["—"],"breakthrough":["突破"],"another":["另一"],"1987":["1987年"],"crises":["危機"],"90":["九成"],"first":["首個"],"capability":["能力"],"strike":["取得"],"businesses":["企業"],"spearheaded":["推動"],"air":["疑慮（釋除疑慮）"],"60":["六成"],"strong":["強大"],"paying":["繳交"],"media":["媒體"],"upgrading":["提升"],"number":["數目"],"well":["良好"],"vital":["重要"],"ahead":["前路"],"numerous":["多次"],"significant":["重大"],"grow":["增長"],"II":["第二階段"],"confidence":["信心"],"rebuttals":["澄清"],"science":["科學"],"light":["因應"],"comparable":["相若"],"structural":["結構性"],"clear":["明確"],"Lingering":["持續"],"firm":["堅定"],"power":["實力"],"swiftly":["迅速"],"us":["我們"],"three":["三"],"trial":["試驗"],"overnight":["一夜之間"],"Consolidating":["鞏固"],"unique":["獨特"],"reached":["達到"],"regulation":["監管"],"within":["內"],"responded":["響應"],"terrorist":["恐怖分子"],"representing":["相當於"],"2016":["2016年"],"May":["5月"],"contracted":["收縮"],"big":["大"],"downturn":["逆轉"],"decent":["理想"],"time":["時"],"months":["個月"],"well-entrenched":["難以取代"],"invest":["投資"],"plays":["發揮"],"help":["幫助"],"smooth":["暢順"],"past":["過去"],"good":["良好"],"Upgrading":["提升"],"gain":["爭取"],"continued":["繼續"],"hit":["打擊"],"cyclical":["周期性"],"greenness":["綠色基準"],"whole":["整體"],"intelligence":["智能（人工智能）"],"drawn":["備受"],"together":["一同"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"penetration":["滲透率"],"million":["百萬"],"AoF":["金融學院（Academy

公司社會責任\n\n香港金融管理局致力於履行其企業社會責任，並以成為一個負責任且可持續的組織為目標。此承諾體現在各項範疇，包括推動一個可持續且環保的市場，支持更廣的社區，保護環境及培育一個友善的工作環境。\n\n# 市場\n\n# 綠色與永續銀行業\n\n氣候變化是影響人類福祉和全球經濟可持續發展的重大風險之一。銀行體系作為社會不可分割的**部分**，其**運作**亦會受到**影響**，因此應更**積極**地**管理**氣候風險。香港金融管理局致力於**探討****應對**此**挑戰**的**方法**。在此背景下，香港金融管理局於**5月****公布**了一系列**推動**香港綠色金融發展的措施，**包括**採用**三個階段**的策略**推動**綠色和可持續銀行業務。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n作為外匯基金的投資經理，金管局認為責任投資（RI）的概念與其投資工作高度相關。由於金管局是全球最大資產擁有者之一，它將對基金經理的資產選擇產生重大影響。\n\n# 我們的理念\n\n香港金融管理局視風險共融為一種考慮各項環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素對長線投資回報及其可持續性的投資方法。香港金融管理局認為，透過強調適當的風險共融及可持續長線經濟表現，可以更好取得交換基金的投資目標，並減少與其相關投資的ESG相關事項所帶來的風險。\n\n# 我們的原則\n\n香港金融管理局的指導原則是，若環境、社會及管治投資的長線風險調整後回報與其他投資相若，則通常會將其列為優先考慮。鑒於此，香港金融管理局會在投資過程中採用以下能體現其作為負責任投資者理念的原則：\n\n# 整合\n\n香港金融管理局將環境、社會及管治因素納入其投資分析流程，以物色風險和機遇，因為它認為這些因素可以實質影響其投資的長線價值。具體而言，香港金融管理局一直將環境、社會及管治因素納入公共及私人市場的投資流程。對於公共市場投資，香港金融管理局在其債券投資的信用風險分析中傳達環境、社會及管治因素。會物色並委任與香港金融管理局的責任投資理念配合的外部經理。香港金融管理局向所有外部經理分享其責任投資理念，並預期他們以配合的方式，使整體可持續長線經濟表現目標得以實現。對於私人市場投資，香港金融管理局的普通合夥人的環境、社會及管治政策和實務將作為其盡職審查過程的一部分被檢視。\n\n# 主動所有權\n\n香港金融管理局以行使股東權利的方式，幫助保障其公開股權投資的長線價值。香港金融管理局認為，以環境、社會及管治因素作指引的負責任企業行為，將有助於長期創造股東價值。香港金融管理局的資產經理預期將通過行使投票權和聘用關切的企業，採納積極所有權的方式，幫助香港金融管理局履行其對相關投資的責任。\n\n# 合作\n\n香港金融管理局致力與理念相近的投資者和監管機構攜手，推動投資的長線良好管理。它參與並在公開活動上發言，分享觀點，鼓勵投資界採用責任投資。\n\n請參閱儲備管理章節，以瞭解香港金融管理局於該年就利率影響的相關工作細則。\n\n# 推動金融普及\n\n香港金融管理局非常重視金融普及，並已付出重大努力，以推動社會不同群體獲得基本的銀行服務，以滿足大眾的每日基本需要以及合法企業的營運需要。特別是，香港金融管理局一直與銀行業緊密工作於以下優先考慮的範疇：\n\n鼓勵銀行推出更多體格銀行設施，並制定數碼和創新渠道以提供基本的銀行服務，服務大眾，特別是偏遠地區和公共屋邨的居民，以及長者；\n\n促進及監察個人和中小企銀行帳戶的可存取性；\n\n提升銀行服務對具體客戶群體的易達性，例如，身心障礙人士和少數族裔客戶；\n\n促進及監察中小企獲得銀行信貸的可及性；和\n\n授予八家虛擬銀行授權，它們將在提供銀行服務中積極推動金融普及。\n\n# 社群\n\n# 推動金融素養\n\n香港金融管理局透過各項渠道推動金融知識。除了運作教育計劃以推動公眾明智和負責任地運用銀行及金融服務外，香港金融管理局在其重新設計的官方網站上設有「精明消費者」的新專區，讓公眾可以發現涵蓋廣泛的銀行及相關產品和服務的有用資訊和精明提示。Facebook、LinkedIn、YouTube、Instagram 和 Twitter 等社交媒體平台亦被運用，此外還有香港金融管理局官方網站和研究報告，以提供銀行和金融事務的最新資訊。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心自2003年起作為金管局的重大公共教育和研究資源，介紹香港金融管理局的工作，並推動公眾對貨幣和銀行事務的認識。每日為來自學校和非牟利機構的團體訪問學者提供以...作指引的教育導賞服務。亦舉辦公共教育研討會和其他活動，以提升學生的財務知識和素養。此外，香港金融管理局與投資者及財務教育委員會緊密合作，透過其財務教育平台「錢氏家族」推動香港的財務素養。\n\n請參閱「公司職能」章節，以瞭解香港金融管理局於本年推動金融知識的更多細則。請參閱「銀行穩定」章節，以瞭解香港金融管理局於本年推動金融普及性的更多細則。\n\n# 應對特殊群體需要\n\n# 香港紙幣的可達性\n\n2018年紙幣系列保留了上一系列紙幣中運用於幫助視障人士區分面額的特點。這些輔助特性包括盲文、觸覺線條和高觸感數字。\n\n為幫助視障人士區分紙幣的面額，一個由香港金融管理局贊助、香港盲人輔導會開發的手機應用程式，利用手機的鏡頭掃描紙幣圖案以識別面額。這個應用程式可於 Apple App Store 及 Google Play Store 免费下載。一個由香港金融管理局和三家發行紙幣的銀行贊助的測量模板亦已引入，用於測量紙幣的長度。它可測量 2018 系列以及現時流通的紙幣。這個模板在一面壓印了盲文，另一面則印有符號。它在服務視障人士的志願機構免費派發。\n\n# 硬幣收集計畫\n\n在「硬幣收集」計劃下，香港金融管理局與香港社會服務聯會合作，採取「硬幣車」來收集各非政府組織在籌款日所用的硬幣。\n\n# 公眾資訊的可近性\n\n經過翻新的香港金融管理局官方網站於9月推出。翻新的網站加強了導航結構，以促進用戶根據自身偏好方便地搜尋。特別是，網站在「智醒消費」專頁下設有專頁「其他語言資訊」，提供七種少數族裔社群常用語言的銀行服務有用資訊，包括印尼語、印地語、尼泊爾語、旁遮普語、塔加祿語、泰語和烏爾都語。\n\n香港金融管理局致力於確保其網站符合萬維網聯盟（W3C）網頁內容無障礙指引（WCAG）2.0 AA級別的最高標準，以促進市民特別需要人士方便地瀏覽網上資訊。\n\n# 志願服務及慈善活動\n\n香港金融管理局透過擔任義工及慈善活動的**部分**，支持社區服務。**高級**公民家居安全**團體**向香港金融管理局**頒發**社區參與水晶獎，以表彰其參與2018年**愛**心與安心企業參與計劃。\n\n二零一九年香港醫療輔助隊團隊參與的慈善活動\n\n「喂！與年青人同行」由青年外展部主辦。\n\n藝術家與香港殘疾藝術團體之代表到訪香港文物管理局辦公室，欣賞其藝術作品的展覽。\n\n香港金融管理局職員積極參與獻血日、全港旗日、社聯綠日、愛牙日、午餐捐款日、休閒服裝日及定期宣傳活動，為慈善團體收集衣物、玩具及其他可重用項目。\n\n香港金融管理局會員積極選持倉盤參與香港紅十字會舉辦的獻血日活動。\n\n# 友善組織\n\n為表彰香港醫療協會對關愛社區的承諾，香港社會服務聯會已連續第13年授予其「十年+友善機構標誌」。\n\n# 環境\n\n# 綠色辦公措施\n\n香港金融管理局設有完善的環保政策以保護及保本環境。 該政策和落實措施會定期在員工當中公佈。綠色辦公室措施包括：\n\n# 紙張\/影印\/印刷\n\n鼓勵使用回收紙張及信封；\n分發電子副本，而非文件之紙本；\n- 在紙張兩面印刷；\n-

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of

意見\n\n我證明我已審核了外匯基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）於第187至293頁所列的財務報表，其中包括外匯基金及本集團於2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該年止的收益及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並附有財務報表附註，包括重大會計政策的概要。\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實及公允地呈現了基金及本集團於2019年12月31日的財務狀況，以及截至該年止的財務表現和現金流量，並根據香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港會計準則」）作出，且已根據《外匯基金條例》第7日第66章項下行政長官的指示妥善編製。\n\n# 意見的根據\n\n我進行了審計，根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》第7日所作出的指示，以及審計署的審計準則。我在這些準則下的責任在我的報告中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」部分進一步描述。我根據這些準則，獨立於該集團，並且我已履行我的其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據是足夠和適當的，以提供我意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項為那些在我專業判斷下，對於我審計截至2019年12月31日止年度財務報表而言，最為重要的事項。 這些事項已在我的財務報表整體審計背景下加以處理，並在形成我對此的意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 金融資產與金融負債以公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註 2.5、2.6 及 38.1。\n\n於2019年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總額為3,874,223百萬港元，金融負債總額為1,158,686百萬港元，並按公允價值估值。\n\n對於這些金融資產的 91% 及所有這些金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價 (第一層級輸入) 或利用觀測到的市場數據為基礎的估值技術估計 (第二層級輸入)。\n\n對於其餘 9% 的這些金融資產，其公允價值是利用估值技術估計，而這些技術的輸入數據並非根據可觀察的市場數據（第 3 層輸入數據）。 這些金融資產總計為金管局 3,387.58 百萬港元，包括主要為未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於大量且涉及的估算，以公允價值衡量金融資產和金融負債是關鍵審計事項。\n\n對金融資產及金融負債公允價值之審計程序包括：\n\n取得對評估不同類別的金融資產和金融負債程序的了解，包括相關控制；\n\n評估和測試控制，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n\n取得外部確認以驗證財務資產與財務負債的估值、存在性、權利與義務以及完整性；\n\n在運用報價市場價格時，核實價格與獨立來源是否一致；\n\n在運用以可觀察市場數據為根據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性及假設的合理性，並將輸入數據核證至獨立來源；以及\n\n在運用未根據可觀察市場數據的估值技術時，評估估值方法的適合性以及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 投資物業以公允價值估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註 2.11、18 及 19。\n\n本集團的投資物業以其公允價值列示，於2019年12月31日總計為金管局$22,481百萬。本集團亦擁有總計為金管局$44,506百萬的兩十兩合資企業權益，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由本集團直接持有或由合資企業持有，主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值根據決定。 該等估值涉及重大判斷和估計，包括估值方法和所運用的假設。\n\n對投資物業以公允價值估值的審計程序包括：\n\n取得及審閱本集團直接或透過合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平價值是根據估值報告中列示的估值而定。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性和資格；以及\n\n評估估值方法之適合性，以及假設和輸入數據的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港貨幣當局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港貨幣當局2019年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此表示任何形式的保證結果。\n\n與我審計財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在此過程中顧及其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識存在重大不符，或以其他方式顯著錯誤陳述。根據我所表現的工作，如果我認為此其他資訊存在重大錯誤陳述，我規定要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 貨幣當局及結匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會對財務報表的責任\n\n根據香港會計師公會頒布的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《交換基金條例》第7日行政長官作出指示，貨幣當局負責編製真實公允地反映財務狀況的財務報表，並負責建立貨幣當局認為必要的內部控制，以使編製的財務報表不存在因訛騙或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團繼續經營的 ability，並根據適用情況披露與展望未來相關的事項，以及利用展望未來為基礎的會計準則。\n\n交易所基金諮詢委員會審核小組負責監察本集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師的責任 – 審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理保證，無論財務報表整體是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論該錯誤陳述是由於訛騙或錯誤所致，並發行一份審計報告，其中包括我的意見。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並非保證根據審計署審計準則進行的審計，一定會發現當重大錯誤陳述存在時。錯誤陳述可能帶來自訛騙或錯誤，並且如果個別或總體而言，可合理預期會影響依賴這些財務報表所作出的用戶決定，則會被考慮為重大。\n\n作為審計署審計準則下審計的一部分，我會在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷，並維持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n物色並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是由於訛騙或錯誤所致，設計及執行對應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠及適當的審計證據以提供我意見的基礎。由於訛騙可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕內部控制，因此未偵察出因訛騙而產生的重大錯誤陳述的風險，比因錯誤而產生的風險更高。\n\n取得對與審計相關的內部控制的了解，以便設計適當於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的成效發表意見。\n\n評估貨幣當局作出的會計政策的適合性，以及會計估計和相關披露的合理性。\n\n結論關於貨幣當局使用持續經營會計基準的適合性，以及根據所取得的審計證據，無論是否存在與可能造成本集團重大不確定性，進而對本集團能否繼續經營的持續經營能力產生懷疑。如果我結論存在重大不確定性，我規定要在我審計報告中提示財務報表中的相關披露，或者，如果這些披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論是根據截至我審計報告日期的審計證據。然而，未來事件或條件可能會導致本集團停止繼續經營；\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈現方式、結構和內容，包括所揭露的資訊，以及財務報表是否以適當的方式呈現了相關的交易和事件，從而錄得公允的表達；並取得足夠的適當審計證據，有關本集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責本集團審計的方向、監督和執行。我維持對我的審計意見的全部責任。\n\n我與證券基金諮詢委員會審核小組聯繫，有關審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重大的審計發現，包括我在審計過程中物色的任何重大的內部控制缺陷。\n\n我亦提供審計委員會給予交易所基金諮詢委員會的報告，證明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們聯繫所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n從與證券基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事項中，我決定在審計本現行期間的財務報表時，哪些事項最為重要，因此構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或監管不允許公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我決定不應在報告中溝通某事項，因為這樣做的不利後果合理預計將超過此類溝通的公共利益福利。\n\n朱約翰\n審計署署長\n\n審計署\n26樓\n入境事務大樓\n7日告士打道\n灣仔，香港\n\n2020年4月3日\n"}
