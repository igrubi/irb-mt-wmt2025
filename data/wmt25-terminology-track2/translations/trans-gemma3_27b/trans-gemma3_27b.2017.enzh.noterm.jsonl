{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","zh":"# 行政總裁的話\n\n二零一七年，全球經濟和金融市場表現優於預期：實體經濟呈現穩定增長；通脹維持低位；美國聯邦儲備局當年三次升息及縮減資產負債表，並未導致新興市場經濟體出現資金外流或美元走強的局面。在樂觀情緒的帶動下，全球股市持續攀升，包括美國三大股指均屢創新高。明晟新興市場指數大漲百分之三十四。香港恆生指數在二零一七年上漲近八千點（或百分之三十六），並於二零一八年一月突破三萬點關口，創下歷史新高。\n\n在如此有利的環境下，許多投資者都充滿樂觀，甚至興奮。然而，這種情況一直持續到今年二月初，當時最新的數據顯示美國薪資增長高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通貨膨脹風險，並引發全球股市的大幅修正。道瓊斯指數在二月中旬的兩天內下跌超過1000點，而香港恆生指數在同一週下跌超過3000點。美國10年期國債收益率一度飆升至2.95%。資金流向的迅速逆轉表明，創紀錄的市場估值並未建立在堅實的基礎之上。這也提醒我們，健全且穩健的金融體系對於香港應對資產市場波動和資本外流帶來的挑戰至關重要。\n\n# 銀行系統的韌性因預防措施而增強\n\n正如俗語所說：「預防勝於治療」。為保障香港銀行及金融體系的穩定，金管局於二零一七年實施進一步的風險緩解措施。五月，我們推出第八輪銀行按揭貸款逆周期措施，並加強銀行對房地產發展商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在提升銀行體系抵禦房地產市場下行風險的能力。經過多輪措施，截至二零一七年底，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率已從二零零九年九月的六十四％下降至四十九％，而平均負債收入比率亦從二零一零年八月的四十一％下降至三十五％。\n\n二零一七年，我們成立了決議辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理對被視為「大到不能倒」的不可持續金融機構的解決方案。這將有助於避免重蹈二零零八年全球金融危機的覆轍，當時公帑被用於拯救瀕臨破產的金融機構，並將其倒閉對金融體系、經濟及社會大眾的影響降至最低。\n\n穩健的風險管理是銀行業穩定及可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率及資本充足比率均遠高於適用法規要求，並位居全球前列。這無疑反映了香港銀行體系的高度韌性。事實上，銀行業於2017年錄得強勁增長，總貸款增加16%，資產質素亦保持良好。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2016年的0.72%下降至0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均值2.2%。銀行業整體股本回報率（基於稅前經營利潤）於2017年達到11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心而言，處於非常健康的水平。\n\n# 健全的銀行業是長期金融穩定的關鍵。\n\n2008 年全球金融危機揭示了單純依靠規則和法規來約束金融業追求利潤，而忽略其首要責任的局限性。鑑於此，金管局近年來加強推廣「穩健銀行」行為準則，鼓勵銀行發展並秉持良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是為了應對銀行員工為了追求短期利益而犧牲客戶或銀行的長期利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行建立與其企業文化和價值觀相符的適當激勵機制。作為這項工作的一部分，我們於 2017 年 3 月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事（INED）年度會議，旨在強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並賦能獨立非執行董事更有效地履行其監督和監察職能。\n\n在銀行業界的支持下，二零一七年對金管局推動金融普惠而言是豐收的一年。六間銀行實體分行及三間流動分行已在偏遠地區投入服務。香港銀行公會與八達通及一家便利店連鎖店協商安排，推出先導計劃，讓長者毋須購物即可在偏遠地區的便利店提取現金。香港郵政今年亦將在主要位於離島及新界的七間郵局推出長者現金提取服務。至於開戶方面，金管局去年設立網頁及專責電子郵件地址，由專門團隊跟進公眾有關開立銀行戶口的查詢或投訴。得益於各方共同努力，個人及公司銀行戶口開戶的客戶體驗已顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技：銀行業的變革力量\n\n在科技日新月異的時代，金融科技已逐漸融入我們的日常生活。在瞬息萬變的科技環境下，銀行必須擁抱新發展，並積極在金融科技的應用上追求創新。為迎接智慧銀行的新紀元，金管局於九月推出七項舉措（詳見第106頁），旨在推動銀行採用金融科技，以提升銀行產品及服務的質素。 這些舉措雖然各自獨立，但彼此互補，將會徹底改變香港支付及銀行服務的未來格局。客戶不僅可以享用更便捷、更高效、更安全的支付及銀行服務，更可擁有更多選擇及對其財務交易更大的控制權。金融科技將會是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，而邁入智慧銀行的新紀元，亦將為銀行提供一個升級轉型的大好機會。\n\n# 由「一帶一路」及大灣區倡議所創造的巨大機遇\n\n隨着國際金融中心競爭日趨激烈，多元化的金融業對香港至關重要。二零一七年，香港金融管理局加強工作，提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。鑑於香港擁有「背靠內地、聯通世界」獨一無二的優勢， Belt and Road（「一帶一路」）倡議和粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）的發展將為金融和銀行業帶來巨大機遇，並為香港的經濟增長注入新動力。為響應「一帶一路」倡議而成立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室自成立以來，合作夥伴數量已增至約九十個，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資的融資樞紐奠定了堅實基礎。中國開發銀行於二零一七年在香港發行首期「一帶一路」債券，凸顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面可以發揮的關鍵作用。\n\n除了基礎設施融資外，我們亦積極參與香港發展成為企業資金中心、私募股權基金和亞洲衍生工具業務中心的過程，透過吸引跨國企業和主要金融機構來港管理其資金、資產和各項金融風險。這些舉措將進一步鞏固和提升香港的金融及相關專業服務業。香港金融管理局亦與負責大灣區發展的相關部門保持密切對話，以加強合作，從而為大灣區成為世界級城市群的金融發展做出貢獻。\n\n多年來，香港金融業在「發揮香港優勢，滿足國家需求」的主題下不斷發展。隨著滬港通於2014年推出，深港通於2016年推出，以及去年七月開通「債券通」北向交易，經香港金融平台連接內地與世界其他地區的市場互聯互通已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這凸顯了香港作為金融中介，促進全球投資者進入內地金融市場的獨特角色。2017年，香港繼續保持全球離岸人民幣業務領先地位。人民幣即時大額結算系統的平均每日成交額達9000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計，當年全球人民幣支付交易超過70%經由香港處理。離岸人民幣市場持續暢順運作並穩步發展。\n\n# 培養人才以強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融業持續發展，培養人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局非常重視銀行業的軟實力，並一直鼓勵和支持銀行從業員的持續能力建設。在推出反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資和網絡安全兩個能力提升框架模組後，我們去年進一步擴大其覆蓋範圍，納入零售財富管理和資金管理，以透過持續專業發展提升銀行從業員的核心競爭力。香港金融管理局亦致力於培養銀行業的年輕人才。於2017年，我們與業界合作推出私人財富管理學徒計劃和金融科技人才加速計劃。鑑於反應熱烈，這些計劃的覆蓋範圍未來將進一步擴大。\n\n# 審慎投資策略，於中長期達致合理且穩定的回報\n\n在全球經濟強勁增長的支持下，外匯基金去年錄得創紀錄的投資收入達2640億港元，各類資產均獲利，包括股權、債券及外匯。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的收益率為12.1%，而後盾組合則增長1.8%。自2009年成立以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部收益率高達13.7%。儘管去年的投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求金管局繼續審慎管理外匯基金。我們將保持靈活敏捷，密切監察市場發展，並在適當時候採取防禦措施。長期增長組合（LTGP）下的投資亦將進一步擴大。與往常一樣，在管理香港市民的財富時，將繼續秉持「首重保本，次重長遠增長」的投資原則，並在可接受的風險水平之內進行。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續了去年的增長勢頭，但2018年仍然充滿不確定性和風險。這些風險包括：倘若通脹加劇，美國利率可能以較預期更快的速度上升；貿易摩擦可能升級；以及地緣政治局勢可能惡化。如果這些下行風險成為現實，將對全球金融市場產生重大且廣泛的影響，並對香港的資金流動、資產價格和實體經濟造成連帶效應。因此，我們務必審慎管理這些風險。\n\n未來數月，香港利率走勢很可能仍將成為關注焦點。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備局已六次加息。隨著港元利率與美元利率之間的利差擴大，資金從港元流向美元的誘因亦隨之增加。近期港元受到貶值壓力，已觸及7.85弱方兌換承諾（CU）。正如我們多次表示，當觸及7.85弱方兌換承諾時，金管局會扮演「超級換匯商」的角色，在市場上買入港元並賣出美元，以確保港元匯率不會跌穿7.85水平。這些操作是正常且符合聯繫匯率制度設計的，不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，外匯基金目前持有超過4萬億港元的資產，其中港元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，為資金外流時提供強大的緩衝。多年來，金管局已建立多道防線，以維護銀行和金融體系的穩定。從積極的角度來看，資金外流將導致港元利率逐步上升，這將有助於香港利率環境的正常化，從而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，金管局將保持警惕，並盡一切努力維持香港的貨幣和銀行穩定。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟擴張更趨同步的背景下，香港在2017年錄得更快速的經濟增長、更緊張的勞工市場狀況以及溫和的通脹壓力。預期2018年的經濟增長將保持強勁。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n在全球經濟擴張更趨同步之際，香港經濟在二零一七年增長較快。實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長率升至3.8%，遠高於二零一六年2.1%的增長率，以及過去十年約3%的長期增長率（圖表1及表1）。 內需轉強，私人消費增長加快，整體投資開支亦告復甦。 內需強勁反映了良好的就業及收入狀況、資產價格飆升以及改善的商業氣氛。 對外方面，由於全球貿易流量增加，香港商品出口增長加快；而得益於蓬勃的貿易和貨運流量以及來港旅遊改善，服務出口亦告復甦。 商品進口因出口帶動而增長強勁，而隨著居民旅遊興趣濃厚，服務進口亦穩步增長。 總體而言，貿易順差縮減，對GDP增長構成負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，港元匯率主要受到港元與美元之間的負利率差所帶動的利率套利活動影響，普遍較美元走弱。這反映了聯繫匯率制度按照其設計正常運作。雖然仍處於相對低位，但由於首次公開招股相關的資金需求以及銀行年末流動資金需要，香港銀行同業拆息在2017年底面臨更大的上行壓力。至於信貸增長方面，總貸款在經歷了兩年的個位數增長後，2017年大幅增長16.1%，反映經濟狀況改善和金融市場情緒積極。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行信貸審慎標準並未放寬，整體貸款質素仍然良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通脹壓力在二零一七年全年受到良好控制（圖表二）。撇除政府一次性緩解措施的影響，基本通脹率下降至1.7%，較二零一六年2.3%有所回落。特別是，物價指數中的房價增長速度放緩，反映了二零一六年私人住宅新租賃價格增長放緩的影響。更廣泛地說，在強勁的產出增長下，名義工資和收入增長溫和，有助於抑制本地成本壓力。進口價格通脹亦保持平穩，與香港主要進口來源地的低通脹情況一致，儘管美元走弱。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年，隨著經濟增長優於預期，勞動力市場趨於緊繃。經季節性調整後，失業率從2016年的3.4%下降至2017年末的2.9%，創近20年來首次低於3%的記錄（圖表3）。大多數主要經濟行業的失業率均有所下降，其中零售、金融以及專業及商務服務行業的降幅尤為顯著。隨著總就業人數增長加快，以及私營部門職位空缺增加，整體勞動力需求持續增強。勞動力也隨之擴大，部分反映了年長勞工（55歲及以上）的參與度提高。與勞動力市場趨緊和通脹降低相符，實際工資和收入增長速度加快。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股市在2017年經歷了一段幾乎不間斷的升勢。恆生指數上漲了36%，為自2010年以來的最大年度增幅（圖表4）。這段升勢反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀情緒，並在一定程度上受到內地投資者透過滬港通和深港通的大量資金流入的支持。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年末保持在高位。平均每日成交額從前一年的669億港元增長至883億港元，本地市場籌集的整體股本資金也增加至5814億港元，較一年前的4901億港元為高。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持升勢（圖表4）。交易量由去年的54,701個單位增加至61,591個單位，而2017年的房屋價格上升了14.8%。房屋負擔能力進一步下降，價格收入比為16.4，高於1997年的先前高峰，而收入與按揭比率為74.1，遠高於長期平均水平。1 鑑於物業價格上漲以及銀行間按揭業務競爭日益激烈，金管局於五月推出第八輪審慎措施，以加強銀行風險管理並保障銀行體系穩定。在這些措施出台後，房屋價格增長暫時放緩，但在第四季度再次加速。至於商業及工業物業市場，全年的交易活動顯著增加，交易價值和交易量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報率與去年相比略有下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計二零一八年的經濟增長將保持穩健。政府預測增長率將介於百分之三至四之間，而私人界分析員則預測經濟平均增長率為百分之三點二。在外部方面，香港的出口表現將繼續受益於全球經濟前景的改善以及來港旅遊的逐步復甦。在內需方面，由於良好的勞工市場狀況，私人消費增長預期將維持。至於固定資本形成，在房屋供應增加及持續基礎設施項目的帶動下，建築及建造活動應會穩步推進。雖然改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升或會構成阻力。\n\n# 通膨與勞動市場\n\n儘管全球通脹仍然溫和，本地成本亦穩步上升，預期香港在2018年的通脹壓力將維持在溫和水平，但通脹率可能較2017年的低位逐步回升。例如，由於私人住宅新租賃的增加，租金可能在2018年下半年加速上漲。市場普遍預測2018年的綜合通脹率仍將維持在溫和的2.2%，而政府預測核心通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築及建造活動的擴張，以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦，預計將在短期內維持勞動力市場的緊張情況。私人機構分析員預測2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%的水平。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2018年的經濟展望存在不少不確定性和風險，包括主要中央銀行貨幣政策正常化以及全球金融市場穩定性等相關因素，同時也包含保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張局勢加劇等情況。特別是，若這些風險實際發生，導致資金從香港流出逆轉，本地貨幣狀況可能比預期更快收緊，進而對實體經濟和資產價格造成下行壓力。\n\n住宅物業市場的展望仍然不明朗。短期內，現有利好的國內經濟狀況、普遍認為的房屋短缺、低按揭利率，以及其他房屋融資來源（包括房地產開發商提供的按揭貸款和來自家長的財政支持）將繼續支撐物業需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會影響市場情緒。長遠來看，物業市場將繼續面臨多重不利因素。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策的正常化，本地按揭利率最終將會上升。此外，在政府增加土地和住宅物業供應的努力下，房屋供需缺口預計將逐漸縮小，這將長期內減輕房價的上漲壓力。\n\n# 銀行業績表現\n\n儘管全球經濟充滿不確定性，香港銀行業在二零一七年仍然保持安全穩健。認可機構的資本及流動資金狀況依然強勁，資產質素維持在健康水平，並得益於息差擴大及信貸增長強勁，盈利能力顯著提升。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，香港銀行同業拆息 (HIBOR) 的一個月及三個月期定盤價在2017年分別上升了49個基點及39個基點。第四季的升幅尤其顯著。儘管如此，以綜合利率衡量的零售銀行港元資金成本在全年內大致保持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行香港分行於2017年總體稅前經營利潤增長了15.8%。表現改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加（+20.3%）及手續費收入增加（+9.4%）。然而，這些增長被外匯及衍生工具業務收入減少（-29.9%）以及經營支出增長（+8.4%）部分抵消。由於2016年記錄的某些非經常性項目，零售銀行的總體稅後利潤下降了18.1%。零售銀行的平均資產稅後回報率從2016年的1.44%下降至1.07%（圖表6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨利息差在2017年擴大至1.45%，較2016年的1.32%有所增加（圖表7），主要受到市場利率上升的影響。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營收的比例從2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然手續費和佣金收入增長了9.4%，但外匯及衍生工具業務產生的收入則下降了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行於2017年的成本收入比下降至41.9%，較2016年的43.2%為低。營運成本增長8.4%，增長幅度低於營運收入的增長幅度11.8%（圖表8）。零售銀行的貸款減值損失減少至73億港元，較2016年的80億港元減少。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n零售銀行信貸品質在年內有所改善，不良貸款比率由前一年的0.72%下降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（圖表9）。同樣地，整體銀行業的不良貸款比率與逾期及重組貸款比率分別由0.85%及0.67%降至0.67%及0.52%。\n\n銀行住宅按揭貸款組合的質素保持良好，截至2017年底，不良貸款比率維持在0.03%的低水平（圖表10）。重新安排貸款比率接近0%。 年底並無出現負股本的住宅按揭貸款，較一年前的四宗案例有所改善。\n\n信用卡貸款的違約率在2017年底維持在0.22%的低水平，較一年前的0.24%略降（圖表10）。 總體違約及重組貸款比率從0.33%小幅下降至0.31%。 呆帳率亦從2016年的1.92%略微下降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業總貸款於2017年增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%為高。 貸款需求增加，受到全球經濟前景樂觀的推動。 由於總存款增長速度慢於總貸款，整體貸款存款比率在2017年底上升至73%，較一年前的68.4%為高。 港元貸款存款比率亦在同期增加至82.7%，較去年的77.1%為高（圖表11）。\n\n與內地相關的貸款（包括在本地註冊銀行內地分行帳戶的貸款）在2017年增長了17.5%，較2016年錄得的7%增長率為高。\n\n# 可議付債務證券持有量\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管港元匯率的壓力有所減弱，香港外匯和貨幣市場仍然保持有序運作，並有充裕的流動性。聯繫匯率制度一直是香港貨幣和金融穩定的堅實支柱，並已證明其對各種衝擊具有高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。這被定義為港元在外的匯價穩定，即在港元與美元的匯率於外匯市場內，維持在每1美元兌7.75至7.85港元之間。 貨幣制度的結構以聯繫匯率制度為特色，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有100%的美元儲備於外匯基金作支持，而貨幣基礎的變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對等。\n\n貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n- 債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供十足擔保；\n- 政府發行的在流通中的紙幣和硬幣；\n- 結算餘額總和，即銀行於香港金融管理局持有的結算戶餘額之總和；\n- 由香港金融管理局代表政府發行的交換基金票據和儲蓄券。\n\n港元匯率的穩定，仰賴自動調整利率機制的運作，以及金管局堅定履行港元兌換基金承諾（CUs）。當港元需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至強方兌換基金承諾水平，即每1美元兌7.75港元時，金管局隨時準備向銀行沽出港元以換取美元。此舉將增加結餘，以降低港元利率，從而營造有利於港元遠離強方限位，並維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區間內的貨幣狀況。反之，若港元供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至弱方兌換基金承諾水平，即每1美元兌7.85港元時，金管局會向銀行買入港元。此舉將減少結餘，以提高港元利率，從而推動港元遠離弱方限位，並維持在兌換區間內。\n\n# 二零一七年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n香港元兌美元匯率在2017年普遍受到貶值壓力（圖一）。主要受到港元與美元利率負利差擴大帶動的息差交易活動影響，港元對美元匯率由1月3日的7.7566逐步走弱至8月22年的年度低點7.8265。在9月下旬至11月初期間，受首次公開募股（IPO）相關資金需求導致港元流動性收緊的支撐，港元匯率略有回升，並在7.80至7.81的窄幅區間內穩定交易。年底，港元貶值壓力再次出現，部分反映港元流動性狀況略有改善，以及年底商業對美元的需求增加。總體而言，2017年香港元外匯市場運作正常。\n\n由於未觸發逆向結算機制，2017年總結餘及未償還的交換基金票據總額維持在約1,225.3億港元，變化不大（圖表2）。年內，金管局共發行額外800億港元的交換基金票據，以滿足銀行增加的流動性管理需求。這導致總結餘在2017年底收縮至1,798億港元。額外發行交換基金票據符合聯繫匯率制度的原則，僅代表貨幣基礎的組成部分發生變化，從總結餘轉移至未償還的交換基金票據。貨幣基礎仍然完全以外匯儲備作支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，香港銀行同業拆息保持低位，但在年底開始面臨更大的上升壓力（圖表3）。儘管市場對美國聯邦儲備局加息及縮減資產負債表有所擔憂，但香港銀行同業拆息在首八個月普遍維持低水平。因此，港元與美元利率之間的負利差在1月至8月期間擴大。從9月起，短期香港銀行同業拆息大幅上升，主要受到首次公開招股（IPO）相關需求及歲末資金需求所驅動。與此同時，短期利率的港元與美元利差負值縮窄。總體而言，2017年短期銀行同業拆息大多在基礎利率以下交易。\n\n基準利率於三月十六日、六月十五日及十二月十四日分別調升，總計調升七十五個基點，由百分之一點零零提升至百分之一點七五。此乃由於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在年內三次調升，總計七十五個基點，由百分之零點五零至零點七五提升至百分之一點二五至一點五零。基準利率的調整乃根據二零零九年三月二十六日公布的修訂公式，即基準利率定為較美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限高出五十個基點，或五日移動平均隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的平均值，以較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤港元兌美元利率差的走勢，港元遠期點數在首三季逐步擴大，9月中旬12個月港元遠期點數達至約-615點子（圖表4）。第四季，隨着港元與美元利率負差的縮窄，港元遠期點數的折讓略為收窄。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續有序運作，銀行體系流動性充裕。再貼現窗口借款由2016年的53億港元增加至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直以來為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供堅實的錨定作用，並在歷次區域性及全球金融危機中展現出高度的韌性。政府重申對聯繫匯率制度的全力支持，而外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步鞏固了政府承諾的可信度。公眾對港元的信心仍然強勁，視其為支付手段及價值儲存工具。國際貨幣基金會在二零一七年對香港進行第四條諮詢時，重申支持聯繫匯率制度，並表示聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率安排。聯繫匯率制度結合穩健的金融監理和規管、審慎的財政管理以及彈性的市場，一直有效地協助香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港的最佳安排。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對於聯系匯率制度的正常運作至關重要。二零一七年，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動資金及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業、物業相關及與內地相關貸款的監管，以提升銀行業的韌性。隨着美國聯邦儲備局繼續正常化貨幣政策，香港的利率亦會逐步正常化。金管局重申，在聯系匯率制度的設計下，資金流出、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方兌換保證及貨幣基礎減少，均是港元利率正常化的必要過程。金管局亦提醒公眾審慎管理風險，並為潛在的金融動盪做好準備。\n\n為提高外匯基金帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將外匯基金資產的一部分指定用於支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在2017年處於106.7%至108.2%的區間內波動，未觸及上下限觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率收報108.1%（圖表5）。根據聯動匯率制度，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產作為支持投資組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可動用以支持港元匯率。若出現突發衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源將為維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強有力的後盾。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣政策諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣板子委員會（外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下）負責監察和檢討與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。於2017年，貨幣板子委員會審議了多項議題，包括香港房價短期動態的驅動因素、HIBOR與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）利差的決定因素、物業估值變動對中國內地企業借貸的影響，以及按揭貸款還款負擔對香港私人消費的影響。貨幣板子委員會就這些議題的討論記錄，以及提交予貨幣板子委員會的貨幣板運作報告，均已於香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n香港金融研究學院（金研院）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融領域的研究。過去三年，金研院一直致力調整其工作，使其更具政策相關性。這體現在其研討會活動和訪問學者計劃中。金研院已與主要中央銀行和政策機構合作，共同舉辦更多以政策為重點的研討會。同時，於2016年推出的主題研究學者計劃，一直支持更多與金管局重要政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局研究院（HKIMR）接待了18位研究員，並發表了29篇工作論文。該年還舉辦了四個國際會議和研討會：\n- 第八屆國際中華經濟年會於一月在香港舉行，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：走向何方？」。本次年會為學術界、政策制定者和商業經濟學家提供了一個討論與中國大陸經濟相關的重要分析和政策議題的平台。會議共發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋了中國大陸經濟再平衡、結構性改革和國際溢效、人民幣匯率問題，以及中國大陸貨幣政策框架和傳導機制等多個方面。\n- 第15屆香港金融管理局研究院夏季研討會於七月舉行。研討會旨在為香港金融管理局研究院和香港金融管理局的員工提供展示其研究成果的機會，並加強研究人員與來訪學者之間的互動。\n- 香港金融管理局與國際結算銀行合辦的會議，主題為「匯率的價格、實質及金融影響」，於八月舉行。會議為深入且富有洞察力的討論提供了一個平台，涵蓋了廣泛的重要議題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易定價機制、外匯儲備累積中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為。\n- 香港金融管理局、美國聯邦儲備理事會和亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行共同贊助的會議，主題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗教訓」，於十月舉行。會議回顧了過去十年來主要中央銀行在非常規貨幣政策（UMP）方面的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興經濟體的溢效、UMP與銀行信貸，以及UMP對實體經濟和金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n二零一七年，香港金融管理局繼續將監管重點放在認可機構的風險治理框架成效上，包括信貸風險和流動性風險管理體系。年內，另有一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施推出，以加強銀行業抵禦房地產市場下行風險的能力。隨著網絡威脅日益增加，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，金管局啟動了七項舉措，為香港邁入智慧銀行新紀元做好準備。打擊金融犯罪是金管局工作的重點之一，因此認可機構的反洗錢及反恐資金融資控制的成效仍然是金管局監管的重點關注範疇。在行為監理方面，金管局進一步採取措施，促進以客戶為中心的企業文化，推動金融普及化，並解決中小企業和初創公司在香港開設及維持銀行帳戶所遇到的困難。此外，金管局也致力加強對認可機構投資及保險產品銷售行為的監管，以進一步加強客戶保護。\n\n在本地實施國際監管及會計準則方面，已取得顯著進展，包括資本充足率準則、披露準則、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險限額、復甦計劃以及國際財務報告準則第9號。為配合瞬息萬變的銀行環境及不斷演變的風險格局，並提升能力建設的需求，金管局與業界協調，共同開發董事賦權計劃及銀行業從業員能力提升框架。\n\n《金融機構（決策）條例》於二零一七年七月七日生效，使香港成為少數設有全面跨行業金融機構決策制度的金融穩定委員會成員司法管轄區。該條例確立了金融穩定性的新防線，並賦予貨幣機管局在金融機構出現可能對整體金融體系造成不利系統性影響的破產情況時，以有序方式進行管理的必要權力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全性及穩定性。實現此目標取決於金融體系具備高度韌性，並能為香港經濟提供所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式，甚至在極端情況下通過混亂倒閉，都可能影響體系穩定。作為監管機構，香港金融管理局在確保銀行具備抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在危機中恢復其地位方面發揮關鍵作用，這最終有助於防止破產。金融管理局負責在香港對銀行業務（包括接受存款業務）進行審慎監理。其職責是授權在香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行和接受存款公司，這些機構統稱為認可機構。金融管理局亦負責指定和監管若干金融市場基礎設施。\n\n然而，金管局無法保證，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決機構，致力於確保在人工智能機構（「人工智能」）出現問題時，能夠以有序的方式進行解決程序，從而維持人工智能向其客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的持續性。為此，香港已建立金融機構的解決機制，其中金管局是人工智能等金融機構的解決機構。\n\n# 二零一七年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概覽\n\n二零一七年，共進行了192項離場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括金融機構評估（CAMEL評級）1、公司治理、業務營運及資產負債管理機構的風險管理。作為金管局持續努力提升資產負債管理機構風險管治水平的一環，已與資產負債管理機構的董事會或董事級委員會舉行了30次會議，討論重點為重要的風險管理議題。金管局亦進行了一項調查，以監察對其最新公司治理指引的採用情況。此外，金管局、資產負債管理機構及其外部審計師之間，亦召開了27次三方會議。\n\n除了場外活動外，香港金融管理局繼續進行定期的現場檢查，並輔以針對被評估為較高風險領域的主題審查。這種做法使金管局能夠優先調配監管資源，專注於人工智能所面臨的新興及更重要的風險。金管局在年內進行了401次現場檢查和主題審查。信貸風險管理和控制仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點。另一個主要關注點是科技風險和營運風險管理。金管局亦增加了海外檢查的數量，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（反洗錢\/反恐融資）控制的現場檢查和主題審查數量。金管局亦由專門團隊對人工智能在證券、投資產品、保險及強積金（MPF）相關業務中的活動進行現場檢查。\n\n# 信用風險監控\n\n# 信用增長與資產品質\n\n總體銀行貸款增長了16.1%，與2016年的6.5%增長率相比顯著提升。如表2所示，貸款增長涵蓋面廣。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款於2017年底增長17.5%，達到4,188億港元（表3）。其中包括由在香港註冊成立銀行的內地子公司記錄的644億港元貸款。\n\n2017年，銀行資產品質保持良好。零售銀行不良貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%略降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均值2.2%。整體銀行業的不良貸款比率則由0.85%下降至0.67%。 فيما يتعلق與中國大陸相關的貸款，零售銀行此類貸款的不良貸款比率在2017年由0.82%略降至0.75%。整體銀行業的相關比率則由前一年的0.80%下降至0.67%。\n\n年內，金管局加強監管工作，以確保認可金融機構持續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，對認可金融機構對主要企業的風險敞口監控得到加強。 針對性的主題檢查已進行，重點關注關鍵的信貸風險管理控制，例如貸款承銷標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險管治框架，以及對物業發展商貸款、資產擔保融資和保險費融資的風險管理。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n物業價格在2017年持續上漲。 銀行體系授出的貸款中，涉及多重按揭或收入主要來自香港以外的借款人個案增加。 鑒於這些發展，香港金融管理局於5月19日推出新一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。 第八輪措施包括提高銀行體系批准新的住宅按揭貸款時，計算資本風險比率的最低比率；降低適用於已持有按揭的借款人的物業按揭貸款成貸比率上限；以及降低適用於收入主要來自香港以外的借款人的債務收入比率上限。\n\n香港金融管理局自2009年起推出的房地產按揭貸款宏觀審慎措施，已提升銀行抵禦房地產市場風險的能力。在首次推出逆周期措施之前，新的住宅按揭貸款平均貸款價值比率由2009年9月的64%下降至2017年12月的49%。同期，平均債務收入比率亦由2010年8月的41%下降至2017年12月的35%，當時首次實施債務收入比率上限（圖表1）。\n\n香港金融管理局觀察到，部分發展商以高負債融資其房地產發展項目，並且部分發展商向買家提供高貸款價值比率的按揭貸款。為應對這些發展項目所帶來的風險，金管局於五月十二日推出新的風險管理措施，規管向房地產發展商的貸款。這些措施包括：要求認可機構降低建築融資的融資上限；要求認可機構為向貸款與股權比例較高的房地產發展商的貸款，撥備更多資本；以及進行一輪主題式檢查，以確保銀行在向房地產發展商提供貸款時，繼續遵守審慎的承銷標準。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局二月份與地政總署合作推出電子提示服務。此服務會在有關按揭物業的進一步按揭於地政總署登記時，向相關的保險銀行發出通知，以便該銀行採取適當的風險緩解措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監控\n\n網絡安全威脅在過去一年持續增加。香港金融管理局加強監管力度，以提升銀行業的網絡安全韌性。作為香港金融管理局於2016年推行的「網絡安全加強計劃」，已有30家認可機構完成評估其網絡防禦的成熟度。此外，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監察委員會在與銀行及證券業界廣泛諮詢後，共同決定為網上股票交易引入強制性雙重認證。亦進行了一輪實地檢查，重點關注銀行在網絡安全控制和營運韌性方面的表現。香港金融管理局亦已完成與主要銀行高層管理人員的討論，以評估銀行如何管理由科技進步帶動的潛在新市場參與者所構成的策略風險。\n\n# 智能銀行\n\n九月，香港金融管理局公布了一系列措施，協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行的新時代。在監管方面，金管局將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括供銀行和科技公司使用的聊天室，以及建立金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會和保險業監管局之間的沙盒聯動機制，以便為跨領域金融科技產品的測試提供單一入口。\n\n香港金管局亦同時推動「銀行營運更便捷」倡議，旨在識別及減少監管上的阻礙，從而進一步提升客戶使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的體驗。目前已成立專案小組，重點關注遠程開戶及帳戶維護、網上金融以及網上財富管理等議題。\n\n已展開對現行虛擬銀行授權指引的回顧，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的引入。\n\n# 庫務活動與流動性風險之監管\n\n隨著美國持續將貨幣政策正常化，全球資金流動可能變得越來越波動。為此，金管局今年加強對流動風險的監管。金管局已透過增加壓力測試情境來加強其監管性流動性壓力測試，其中包括一個更嚴峻但合理的資金外流情境，以及一個短期、受信心驅動的銀行擠兌情境。金管局亦加強對個別認可金融機構流動性狀況的監測和分析，並要求部分認可金融機構加強其流動風險管理能力。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局對各認可金融機構的債券投資組合市場風險管理進行了更多實地檢查。 亦進行了一輪主題審查，以評估認可金融機構增加外幣債券投資活動所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相關風險管理措施的有效性，包括對沖策略。\n\n# 防洗錢及反恐融資\n\n《反洗錢及反恐怖資金融資（金融機構）(修訂)條例草案》於二零一七年六月二十三日憲報，並將於二零一八年生效。此項修訂旨在根據金融行動專案組（FATF）發布的最新國際要求，更新香港的反洗錢及反恐怖資金融資監管制度。 這些變更連同對反洗錢及反恐怖資金融資法定指引的更新，將有助於釐清及落實客戶盡職審查（CDD）流程中的風險為本方法，以用於開戶及維持真實客戶關係，並鼓勵在遠程方式進行這些流程時的創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，金管局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項旨在促進銀行和支付行業金融科技發展和應用的新舉措受到各利益相關者和公眾的廣泛歡迎。 透過一系列在這方面的網絡和能力建設工作，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象進一步提升。 債券通的推出鞏固了香港作為通往中國內地機遇的主要 gateway 的地位。 金管局在企業資金管理中心等其他領域的努力也開始見成效。\n\n# 概述\n\n鑒於科技進步迅速，香港金融管理局於九月宣布推出七項舉措，以協助香港迎接智慧銀行的新時代。 這些舉措包括：\n- 開發「快速支付系統」（FPS），實現數碼零售支付的全面互聯互通；\n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究和人才培養；\n- 提升金融科技領域的跨境合作；\n- 將現有的「金融科技監管沙盒」（FSS）1.0 升級至2.0版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行業務的引入；以及\n- 推廣「銀行營運更便捷」倡議，以盡量減少客戶在數碼體驗中的監管阻礙。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（金融科技促進辦）與香港金融管理局銀行事務部攜手合作，在推動這些措施以鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位方面發揮了關鍵作用。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際地位進一步提升，香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作夥伴數量截至2018年1月31日已增至87個，較其成立初期的約40個大幅增加。年內，IFFO組織及參與了超過10個研討會和工作坊，以促進主要利益相關者之間的經驗交流和協作網絡。尤其值得一提的是，IFFO在其首次債務融資及投資者圓桌會議上主導了基礎設施股權投資的參考條款表制定工作，旨在提升基礎設施項目的銀行信貸度和投資吸引力。\n\n「債券通」於七月正式開通，為香港與內地資本市場互聯互通再添重要里程碑，進一步鞏固了香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場的橋樑地位。年內，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由人民幣2700億元增加至人民幣5000億元。香港繼續保持全球最大的離岸人民幣流動資金庫，人民幣金融中介活動蓬勃發展，體現在本港人民幣即時大額結算系統（RTGS）的高交易量，以及香港佔全球人民幣支付業務的絕大部分。\n\n自2016年引入企業資金中心（CTC）稅務制度後，香港金融管理局加強了宣傳推廣工作，以吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立資金中心。截至2017年底，已有超過40家企業向金管局反映，他們正積極籌備或已在香港設立資金中心運營。\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際討論，議題涉及全球及區域金融穩定。香港金融管理局行政總裁四月起擔任金融穩定委員會（FSB）的監管合作常務委員會（SRC）主席，以領導有關主要金融穩定議題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全和高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐奠定了堅實的基礎。四家銀行間即時大額結算系統和中央資金市場單位（CMU）在2017年實現了100%的系統可用性，高於99.95%的目標。為支持「債券通」北向交易，中央結算及交割系統（CMU）已與兩家內地中央證券登記結算公司（CSD）設立賬戶，以便利「債券通」交易的結算，以及代表相關中央結算及交割系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為提升本地零售支付行業的整體安全及效率，金管局於八月根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》指定四個零售支付系統（RPS）受其監管。金管局亦已對十六間積極推出新產品及服務，以為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳用戶體驗的儲值設施（SVF）持牌人進行監理。此外，電子支票及電子結單付款（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與整個廣東省之間的跨境支付。\n\n# 二零一七年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行措施\n\n鑒於科技進步日新月異，香港金融管理局於九月宣布七項舉措，旨在讓香港為迎接智慧銀行新時代做好準備。這些舉措目標是協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並擁抱銀行與科技融合所帶來的巨大機遇。\n\n智能銀行將提供零售客戶與企業客戶間的全面互聯互通，讓金融服務和交易能夠以極大的靈活性、速度、便利性和安全性進行。\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業及金融科技界緊密合作，並在推行七項措施方面取得了良好進展。\n\n# 快速支付系統\n\n快速支付系統是一個多幣種平台，讓公眾可以透過手機號碼或電郵地址，隨時隨地輕鬆地進行即時資金轉帳。它支援港元和人民幣支付。銀行和非銀行支付服務供應商均可參與快速支付系統，實現所有支付參與者之間的全面互聯互通。由於系統開發工作接近完成，快速支付系統預計於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局帶領一個工作小組，成員包括主要的信用卡計劃營運商、銀行、持牌儲值設施營運商及商戶收單機構，共同制定香港零售支付的通用二維碼標準。 通用二維碼標準將便利商戶使用單一二維碼來接受多個支付服務供應商的二維碼支付方案，為客戶和商戶提供更大的便利。該工作小組已完成相關技術規格，並將制定實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放應用程式介面（API）讓銀行數據可供第三方存取，以促進銀行及其他行業服務的更佳和更便捷整合。因此，用戶可於同一系統內方便地享用整合服務，並確保安全。為促進銀行界發展及採用開放API，香港金融管理局擬定了一份開放API框架草案，內容包括一系列開放API功能及部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商治理、促進措施和維護模式，並將其提交業界諮詢兩個月。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n其中一個主要研究項目是關於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年第一份DLT白皮書發表後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月出版。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證項目，分別是貿易融資、數位身份管理和按揭申請。它同時也針對在銀行和支付行業部署DLT時，與治理、法律合規以及一般控制原則相關的實施問題提供建議。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德南在香港金融科技日宣布發表關於區塊鏈技術的第二份白皮書。\n\n憑藉香港金融管理局帶領的貿易融資概念驗證工作的成功，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，並將其命名為「香港貿易融資平台」（HKTFP），以數碼化及共享貿易文件，並自動化流程，從而改善整體貿易流程，降低貿易融資業務的風險和欺詐行為。\n\n為擴大金融科技業界的人才庫，香港金融管理局於二零一六年十二月與香港應用科技研究 Institute 合作推出「金融科技人才加速計劃」。反應熱烈，收到了來自四百二十一名申請人的三千多份申請。最終，七十四名學生接受了香港金融管理局及十二家銀行的實習機會，從七月起參與為期六個月或一年的金融科技相關項目工作。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n作為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的第一步，我們正與深圳合作，以促進金融科技和人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室於六月簽訂協議，以（一）為金融科技企業提供互惠的軟著陸支援；（二）於十月聯合舉辦深圳香港金融科技獎，以表彰並獎勵兩地傑出的金融科技產品和解決方案；以及（三）安排香港學生到深圳的金融科技及科技金融公司實習。\n\n香港金融管理局行政總裁陳德南先生（中）在金融科技日與OFDS主任一般賀曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席林家柏博士簽署及交換有關軟著陸安排的諒解備忘錄。\n\n深圳香港金融科技獎電子傳單。\n\n香港金融管理局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及杜拜金融服務管理局簽署金融科技合作協議，內容涵蓋創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊共享以及專業知識交流。\n\n於十一月，香港金融管理局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署諒解備忘錄，共同構建全球貿易連通網絡（GTCN），將新加坡的國家貿易平台與香港貿易 financiing 平台連接，形成跨境分佈式帳本技術基礎設施，以數碼化跨境貿易及貿易融資流程，使其更安全、更高效及更具成本效益。這將是一個開放平台，日後允許其他有意參與的司法管轄區加入。預計全球貿易連通網絡將於二零一九年第一季推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局於二零一六年九月推出的金融科技支援沙盒（FSS）已升級至FSS 2.0，旨在加快與銀行及科技公司之間的溝通，從而促進新構思和倡議。具體而言，FSS 2.0 具有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，以便在銀行及科技公司構思其金融科技項目初期提供意見。\n- 科技公司可透過向聊天室尋求意見，直接使用金融科技支援沙盒，而無需透過銀行。\n- 金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及保險業監管局的沙盒已互相連接，為跨領域金融科技產品的試點計劃提供單一入口。\n\n截至2017年底，已有28項新科技產品於金融穩定服務（FSS）進行測試。在這些案例中，已完成14項試點項目，相關產品隨後已推向市場。\n\n# 銀行服務更便捷計劃\n\n推動銀行服務便捷化計劃正式啟動，旨在減少阻礙科技創新的監管障礙。 成立了一個專案小組，目前專注於以下領域：\n- 遠程開戶及帳戶維護\n- 線上金融\n- 線上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n虛擬銀行沒有實體分行，預期將為香港金融科技的應用提供額外動力，並為客戶帶來嶄新的流動和數碼銀行體驗。 由於它們通常以零售客戶為目標，無論是個人還是中小企業，虛擬銀行亦有助於促進金融普及化。 香港金融管理局已開始檢視現行的《虛擬銀行授權指引》，以期促進虛擬銀行在香港的發展。\n\n# 智慧銀行新紀元\n\n# 監督與創新\n\n香港金融管理局去年公布的七項舉措，旨在為香港迎接智慧銀行新時代做好準備，這是一項大型項目，涉及金管局內部各部門的合作。隨著金融科技成為不可阻擋的趨勢，香港金融管理局行政總裁（銀行監理）陳浩展表示，作為監管機構，金管局必須擁抱這項新趨勢，與最新的科技發展保持同步，並適時調整其監管思維和方式，從而將銀行服務和客戶體驗提升至新境界。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 匯豐儲備基金\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財務司\n\n# 觀點\n\n我謹此證明，我已審核了第157至243頁所載的交換基金及其附屬公司（「本集團」）財務報表，包括截至2017年12月31日的交換基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至同日止年度的收益及支出帳戶、綜合收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，並包括重要的會計政策摘要。\n\n本人認為，截至二零一七年十二月三十一日，該基金及集團的財務報表真實及公允地反映了彼時的財務狀況，以及彼時年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已根據香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》（「香港會計準則」）編製，且符合根據《交換基金條例》（第66章）第7條行政長官指示所作出的適當準備。\n\n# 觀點依據\n\n我依照《交換基金條例》第7條行政長官指示及審計署審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則的責任，於我的報告內「審計師就財務報表審計的責任」一段中進一步闡述。我符合該等準則的要求，與本集團保持獨立，並已履行其他專業道德責任。我相信我所獲得的審計證據充分及適當，為我提供發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是指在我對截至2017年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計過程中，根據我的專業判斷認為最為重要的事項。 這些事項是在我對財務報表整體審計的背景下加以處理，並在形成我的審計意見時予以考慮，我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n香港金融管理局負責其他資料。 這些資料包括香港金融管理局2017年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我的審計報告。\n\n我的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我並未對此等資訊表示任何形式的保証結論。\n\n與我審核財務報表有關，我的責任是閱讀其他資料，並在此過程中考慮該等資料是否與財務報表或我在審核過程中所得知的其他資訊存在重大不符之處，或是否有重大錯誤陳述。如果根據我所執行之工作，我認為此等其他資料存在重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。就此，我沒有任何事項需要報告。\n\n# 香港金融管理局及匯風諮詢委員會審核委員會於財務報表中的職責\n\n香港金融管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則，以及根據《外匯基金條例》第7條行政長官的指示，編製真實公允的財務報表，並為此建立內部控制，以確保財務報表不存在因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n於編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，以及採用持續經營為基礎會計處理。\n\n匯豐基金諮詢委員會審核小組負責監察本集團的財務報告程序。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是獲取合理保證，以確定財務報表整體而言是否不存在重大錯誤陳述，無論該錯誤陳述是由於舞弊或錯誤所致，並發出包含我意見的審計報告。合理保證是高水準的保證，但並不能保證依照審計署審計準則進行的審計，總能發現當重大錯誤陳述存在時予以偵出。錯誤陳述可能源於舞弊或錯誤，如果這些錯誤陳述單獨或彙總起來，可能合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大。\n\n作為符合審計署審計準則的審計一部分，我在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n- 識別及評估財務報表因欺詐或錯誤而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，設計及執行對應這些風險的審計程序，並獲取充分及適當的審計證據，為我的意見提供依據。因欺詐而導致的重大錯誤陳述未被發現的風險，較因錯誤導致的風險為高，因為欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、故意遺漏、不實陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以便設計適宜於情況的審計程序，但並非為了對本集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣機關所用會計政策的適當性，以及會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣機關使用持續經營會計基礎的適當性作出結論，並根據所獲取的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對本集團持續經營能力構成重大不確定性的事件或情況。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我需要於審計報告中引起注意財務報表中的相關披露，或者，如果這些披露不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論基於截至審計報告日所獲取的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致本集團停止持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表的整體列報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公允列報的方式反映相關交易和事件；以及\n- 獲取關於本集團內實體或業務活動的充分適當審計證據，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責集團審計的方向、監督和執行。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我會與證券基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會就審計的計劃範圍和時間安排，以及重要的審計發現（包括我在審計過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷）等事項進行溝通。\n\n我亦向交易所基金諮詢委員會審計小組提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並向彼等通報所有可能合理地被認為影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及如適用，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與外匯基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的事宜，我確定本期間財務報表審計中最重要之事項，並將其定為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果合理預期將高於此類溝通的公共利益，否則我將在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛\n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n香港金融管理局根據財政司司長以匯風儲備基金（基金）監管人的身份所授予的權力，按照《匯風儲備基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要職能是保障港幣的匯價穩定，以及維持香港的貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全。\n\n本基金的資產以四個投資組合管理：即後盾投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合及策略投資組合。後盾投資組合的資產完全與香港貨幣發行局制度下的貨幣基礎相符。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股權市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所及結算所有限公司股份，該等股份由香港特別行政區政府代表本基金購入，以作策略用途。經營分部資料載於附註三十。\n\n# 重要會計政策\n\n## 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表已根據香港財務報告準則（香港財務報告準則為涵蓋所有適用個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（香港會計準則）及香港會計師公會（香港會計師公會）發佈的解釋的統稱）編製，並符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司（統稱為本集團）所採納的重大會計政策摘要載列如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒布若干新的及經修訂的香港財務報告準則，於本會計期間首次生效或可供提早採用。附註三提供有關因首次採納這些發展而導致會計政策的變動（如有），以及這些變動於本及過往會計期間對本集團的相關影響的資料，並於這些財務報表內反映。\n\n## 2.2 財務報表編制基礎\n\n本集團財務報表包括本集團之財務報表以及本集團於聯營公司及合營企業的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司及合營企業的主要業務載於附註十六及十七。\n\n財務報表之編製基礎為歷史成本，除非下列資產及負債按其公允價值列示，其詳細說明如下述會計政策所示：\n- 交易性金融工具（附註2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定以公允價值衡量之金融資產及金融負債（附註2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（附註2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（附註2.11）；及\n- 投資性不動產（附註2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，管理層需要作出判斷、估計和假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和支出的報告金額。 這些估計和相關假設乃基於經驗及管理層認為在當時情況下屬合理的各種其他因素，其結果構成判斷資產和負債賬面價值的基礎，而這些賬面價值並非容易從其他來源得知。 實際結果可能與這些估計存在差異。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續進行檢討。會計估計的修訂，若僅影響該修訂期間，則於該期間內確認；若影響當期及未來期間，則於修訂期間及未來期間內確認。\n\n附註十八載列有關投資物業公平價值估計所用假設的資料。附註三十六載列有關金融工具公平價值估計所用假設的資料。除涉及這些公平價值估計的會計判斷外，本集團應用會計政策並未涉及其他關鍵會計判斷。\n\n## 2.3 子公司及非控制性權益\n\n子公司是由本集團控制的實體。本集團於其與該實體的參與中，承受或擁有來自該實體的變動回報，並有能力透過對該實體的權力影響該等回報時，即控制該實體。評估本集團是否擁有權力時，僅考慮實質權利（由本集團及其他各方持有）。\n"}
