{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2018年是全球金融危機發生十周年，十年間國際政經形勢經歷巨大轉變，當中不乏一幕幕超乎最佳編劇所能想像的場景。我在去年的年報指出，2017年金融市場表現是「喜出望外」，同時提到前景「潛藏隱憂」。回顧2018年，或許可形容為「先喜後悲」。環球多個股票指數在1月創出歷史新高後不久，熾熱的投資情緒旋即遇上中美貿易摩擦的冷鋒，加上英國脫歐談判一直拉鋸、地緣政治惡化、美聯儲四次加息等因素，市場樂觀氣氛急劇逆轉，資產價格在年內大幅下跌。MSCI全球指數從高點至低點曾下跌20.3%，全年累跌約一成，是2008年環球金融危機以來表現最差的一年。恒生指數從高點最多曾下跌26.7%，全年下挫13.6%，錄得七年來最大年度跌幅。\n\n# 聯匯穩健 信心所繫\n\n儘管外圍形勢波動難測，香港金融體系仍然保持穩健，貨幣市場運作暢順無阻。實施三十五年的聯繫匯率制度成功應對了資金流出港元的考驗。自環球金融危機爆發以來，累積約10,000億港元等值的資金流入港元。去年，隨着美國息率上升，港美息差持續擴闊，「沽港元、買美元」套息活動增加，港元兌美元匯率在年初轉弱，2005年制訂的「弱方兌換保證」，自4月首度觸發後，年內再觸發26次。金管局按照既定機制，履行「買港元、沽美元」的弱方兌換保證，有序、透明地在市場承接1,035億港元的港元沽盤。隨着資金流走，一個月香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內累升了105基點，而銀行亦在去年9月美國加息後，上調了最優惠利率。金管局多次和適時通過不同渠道向公眾闡釋「弱方兌換保證」的運作機制，令公眾了解資金流出港元是香港利率正常化的必經過程，也是聯匯制度的正常運作。國際貨幣基金組織在去年年底重申支持香港聯匯制度的立場，特區政府也強調聯匯是香港貨幣穩定的基石。這都有助於穩定香港市民對聯繫匯率的信心。\n\n# 銀行體系 穩中有進\n\n2008年環球金融危機暴露了全球金融系統潛藏的種種弊端及隱患，促使國際間在過去十年協調推出一系列針對金融市場、金融機構的改革，包括在銀行業監管方面，提升企業管治和風險管理。金管局的銀行監管工作重點針對兩方面：一是着眼於銀行資產負債風險的審慎監管，二是銀行的行為操守，二者不可偏廢。資產負債風險監管方面，金管局作為巴塞爾銀行監管委員會(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision)及二十國集團轄下金融穩定理事會(FinancialStability Board)成員，有責任全面落實國際監管標準，確保香港銀行業穩健審慎地經營業務。去年底香港銀行資本充足率達20.3%，不但遠高於國際最低標準要求的8%，也較環球金融危機時的14.7%水平顯著提升。大型銀行去年第四季平均流動覆蓋比率達167.6%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求的90%。與此同時，為避免重蹈環球金融危機時需動用公帑拯救「大得不能倒」金融機構的覆轍，金融穩定理事會制訂了關於金融機構處置機制的國際標準。香港是亞洲區內少數已經全面落實符合機制要求的地區之一，金管局下設的處置機制辦公室正落實該機制的操作細則，要求銀行推行結構性變動令處置預案在需要時能有效實施，去年亦推出了《吸收虧損能力規則》，未來還會陸續推出更多相關規則。\n\n鑑於樓價持續上升，金管局未雨綢繆，在2009至2017年間共推出八輪逆周期措施，確保一旦地產市況逆轉，本港銀行體系有足夠的抗震能力應對衝擊。這些措施成效顯著：新造住宅平均按揭成數由2009年的64%降至2018年底的46%；平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年的41%下調至2018年底的34%。年內銀行信貸錄得4.4%的溫和增長，整體資產質素維持良好，零售銀行不良貸款比率進一步降至0.5%，遠低於國際及本港歷史平均水平。去年銀行業盈利持續增長，整體股東權益回報率連升兩年至13%；多家國際性銀行集團在本港的業務交出了不俗的成績表，成為集團盈利的重要支柱。\n\n# 穩善文化 上行下效\n\n在監管銀行的行為操守方面，金管局在2010年增設銀行操守部，促進銀行公平待客，並加強保障消費者權益。要做到標本兼治，除了訂出各種針對銀行營運基本操守的監管要求外，我們近年來大力推動改革銀行文化，鼓勵銀行循管治、獎勵制度、評估與回饋機制三方面推動穩善文化，務求銀行內部做到上行下效，在根本上恢復、提升客戶對銀行的信任和尊重。繼2017年金管局向全港銀行提供具體的指引，金管局在2018年底進一步推出銀行文化的監管措施，包括要求銀行就企業文化和落實有關措施作出自我評估等，令穩善銀行文化的三大支柱能有效執行。\n\n雖然互聯網和移動金融是全球趨勢，金管局去年仍繼續促進普及金融，照顧未能應用新科技的社群。例如我們連同香港銀行公會推動便利店推出長者透過「易辦事」免購物提款服務，有關便利店網絡已增至逾300家；我們並聯絡香港郵政在7家主要位於離島和新界的郵政局推出長者提款易服務。銀行業界響應金管局的建議，年內積極增加無障礙設施，提供傷健共融的銀行服務，例子之一是設有聲音導航的自動櫃員機數目一年內增加逾十倍至超過700部。另外，在金管局積極推動下，我們預期將會陸續有銀行在偏遠地區開設更多實體分行和增設流動銀行服務，便利市民。\n\n# 智慧銀行 嶄新體驗\n\n金管局與銀行和科技業界緊密合作，在2017年9月啟動「智慧銀行新紀元」，推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為市民帶來嶄新的支付和銀行服務體驗。2018年的亮點，無疑是在9月正式開通的「轉數快」。它是全球獨一無二的零售快速支付系統，打破香港各種電子支付工具和銀行帳戶之間的屏障，讓市民享受全年無休的港元和人民幣即時轉帳服務。金管局還同步推出全球首個「共用二維碼」標準和應用程式，商戶可憑單個二維碼接通多個電子支付系統。「轉數快」推出以來深受市民歡迎，短短半年，登記紀錄已逾258萬個，日均交易量達6萬宗，平均每宗金額分別20,700港元和38,000元人民幣。\n\n去年5月，金管局發出虛擬銀行的認可指引，隨即有33家機構提交虛擬銀行牌照的申請。截至今年四月中，四個牌照已經發出，預期它們將於年內正式投入營運。虛擬銀行有助推動香港金融科技發展和創新，為個人和中小企提供嶄新服務和體驗，並促進普及金融。\n\n此外，金管局在7月發布開放應用程式介面(OpenAPI)框架，銀行將分四階段開放產品和服務的對外接口，開創更靈活、更開放的金融科技環境，讓銀行客戶更便捷地整合帳戶資料、獲取資訊，選取貼合自己需要的服務。年內，共有42項新科技產品使用金管局的金融科技監管沙盒進行測試，當中28項完成試行，有關產品和服務已順利推出市場。\n\n金管局聯同多家銀行研發的「貿易聯動」去年10月正式啟用，這個採用「分布式分類帳技術」的貿易融資平台，將提升銀行審批貿易融資的效率。「貿易聯動」目前正在測試連接其他地區相關平台，以促進跨境貿易融資活動。\n\n金融科技不但廣泛應用於日常生活，近年更走進合規和監管領域。金管局鼓勵銀行運用合規科技(Regtech)協助處理日常營運如監察涉嫌洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的可疑活動。與此同時金管局正研究使用監管科技(Suptech)，進一步提升監管工作的效率和成效。\n\n# 金融實力 鞏固提升\n\n國際金融中心之間是軟實力的較量，我們要不斷順應經濟社會和科技發展的變化，把握機遇，不斷為香港金融業開拓新的發展空間。綠色金融就是香港開拓債券和項目融資市場的一個重大機遇。金管局支持和配合特區政府發展綠色金融，除了配合特區政府籌備1,000億港元的政府綠色債券發行計劃，我們去年還舉辦多場綠色金融研討會，包括兩場國際大型會議，以提升市場對綠色金融的認識、了解和參與，並鼓勵發行機構參與政府去年推出的綠色債券資助計劃和香港的綠色金融認證服務。去年在港發行綠色債券規模逾110億美元，相等於2017年的三倍多。\n\n近年來投資界對基建和相關項目興趣日濃。金管局於2016年成立基建融資促進辦公室(IFFO)，合作夥伴至今已倍增至95家機構，成為區內基建融資的重要交流平台。去年金管局與國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）首次合辦高層圓桌會議，討論香港為中央國有企業「走出去」的獨特優勢和作用，為央企與香港金融、專業服務界日後共拓發展機遇奠下良好基礎。\n","en":"# President's Report\n\n2018 marked the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis, a decade during which the international political and economic landscape underwent tremendous change, with events unfolding that even the most imaginative screenwriters could not have predicted. In last year’s annual report, I described 2017’s financial market performance as “pleasantly surprising,” while also noting that the outlook “held hidden concerns.” Looking back on 2018, it could perhaps be described as a year of “initial joy followed by sorrow.” Shortly after global stock indices reached historic highs in January, the heated investment sentiment ran into the cold front of the US-China trade dispute. Coupled with ongoing Brexit negotiations, deteriorating geopolitical conditions, and four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, market optimism rapidly reversed, and asset prices plummeted throughout the year. The MSCI World Index fell 20.3% from its peak to its trough, with a cumulative decline of approximately 10% for the year – its worst performance since the global financial crisis of 2008. The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 26.7% from its high, ending the year down 13.6%, marking its largest annual decline in seven years.\n\n# Stable exchange rates are key to confidence.\n\nDespite volatile external conditions, Hong Kong’s financial system remains stable and the money market continues to function smoothly. The linked exchange rate system, in place for 35 years, has successfully withstood the test of capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar. Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, approximately HK$1 trillion of funds has flowed into the Hong Kong dollar. Last year, as US interest rates rose, the interest rate spread between Hong Kong and the US continued to widen, leading to increased carry trade activity of selling Hong Kong dollars and buying US dollars. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate weakened at the beginning of the year, and the “weak-side convertibility undertaking,” established in 2005, was triggered for the first time in April and a further 26 times throughout the year. The HKMA, in accordance with established mechanisms, fulfilled the weak-side convertibility undertaking by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars, orderly and transparently absorbing HK$103.5 billion worth of Hong Kong dollar selling orders in the market. As funds flowed out, the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) cumulatively increased by 105 basis points in 2018, and banks also raised their prime lending rates following the US interest rate hike in September last year. The HKMA repeatedly and appropriately explained the operating mechanism of the weak-side convertibility undertaking to the public through various channels, helping the public understand that capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are an inevitable part of the normalization of Hong Kong interest rates and the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system. The International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the Hong Kong linked exchange rate system at the end of last year, and the HKSAR government also emphasized that the linked exchange rate is the cornerstone of monetary stability in Hong Kong. This has helped to stabilize public confidence in the linked exchange rate.\n\n# The banking system remains stable with progress.\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis exposed various shortcomings and hidden dangers within the global financial system, prompting international coordination over the past decade to launch a series of reforms targeting financial markets and institutions, including enhancements to banking supervision, corporate governance, and risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) banking supervision focuses on two key areas: first, prudent regulation of banks’ balance sheet risks; and second, banks’ ethical conduct – neither should be neglected. Regarding balance sheet risk regulation, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board under the G20, the HKMA is responsible for fully implementing international regulatory standards to ensure the sound and prudent operation of the banking sector in Hong Kong. At the end of last year, Hong Kong’s capital adequacy ratio reached 20.3%, significantly higher than the international minimum requirement of 8% and a notable increase from the 14.7% level during the global financial crisis. The average liquidity coverage ratio of large banks in the fourth quarter of last year reached 167.6%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 90%. At the same time, to avoid repeating the mistake of using public funds to rescue “too big to fail” financial institutions during the global financial crisis, the Financial Stability Board developed international standards regarding resolution mechanisms for financial institutions. Hong Kong is one of the few places in Asia that has fully implemented these requirements. The HKMA’s Resolution Office is implementing the operational details of the mechanism, requiring banks to implement structural changes to ensure that resolution plans can be effectively implemented when necessary. Last year also saw the introduction of the “Loss Absorbing Capacity Rules,” and further related rules will be rolled out in the future.\n\nGiven the continued rise in property prices, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority proactively implemented eight rounds of countercyclical measures between 2009 and 2017 to ensure that the banking system has sufficient resilience to withstand shocks should the property market reverse. These measures have been effective: the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential mortgages decreased from 64% in 2009 to 46% at the end of 2018; and the average debt-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in 2010 to 34% at the end of 2018. Bank credit recorded moderate growth of 4.4% this year, overall asset quality remained good, and the non-performing loan ratio of retail banks further decreased to 0.5%, significantly lower than international and Hong Kong historical averages. Last year, the banking sector continued to see profit growth, with the overall return on equity rising for two consecutive years to 13%; several international banking groups also delivered strong performance in their Hong Kong operations, making the city a key pillar of their profitability.\n\n# Cultivate virtue through stability, and let it be emulated by those above and below.\n\nRegarding the ethical conduct of banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established a Banking Conduct Division in 2010 to promote fair treatment of customers and strengthen consumer protection. To address both symptoms and root causes, in addition to establishing regulatory requirements for fundamental banking operational ethics, we have in recent years vigorously promoted a reform of banking culture, encouraging banks to drive a sound and prudent culture through governance, reward systems, and evaluation and feedback mechanisms. This aims to ensure that ethical standards are implemented throughout the banking sector, fundamentally restoring and enhancing customer trust and respect for banks. Following the HKMA’s provision of specific guidance to all banks in Hong Kong in 2017, the HKMA further introduced regulatory measures on banking culture at the end of 2018, including requiring banks to conduct self-assessments on their corporate culture and the implementation of related measures, ensuring the effective implementation of the three pillars of a sound and prudent banking culture.\n\nDespite the global trends of internet and mobile finance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continued to promote financial inclusion last year, catering to communities unable to utilize new technologies. For example, we collaborated with the Hong Kong Association of Banks to encourage convenience stores to launch a no-purchase withdrawal service for seniors through “Easy Services,” with the network of participating stores now exceeding 300. We also worked with Hong Kong Post to introduce the “Easy Withdrawal for Seniors” service at seven post offices primarily located in the outlying islands and New Territories. In response to the HKMA’s recommendations, the banking sector actively increased accessibility facilities throughout the year, providing inclusive banking services. One example is the more than tenfold increase in the number of ATMs with voice navigation, to over 700. Furthermore, with the HKMA’s active promotion, we anticipate that banks will progressively open more physical branches and increase mobile banking services in remote areas, providing greater convenience for the public.\n\n# Smart Banking, a New Experience.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been working closely with the banking and technology sectors since September 2017 to launch the “Smart Banking Era,” promoting the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong and bringing new payment and banking service experiences to the public. A key highlight of 2018 was the official launch of “Faster Payment System” (FPS) in September. This is a unique retail fast payment system globally, breaking down barriers between various electronic payment tools and bank accounts in Hong Kong, allowing citizens to enjoy real-time transfers in Hong Kong and Renminbi currencies 24\/7. The HKMA simultaneously launched the world’s first “Common QR Code” standard and application, enabling merchants to connect to multiple electronic payment systems with a single QR code. Since its launch, FPS has been widely welcomed by the public, with registrations exceeding 2.58 million within just six months and an average daily transaction volume of 60,000, with an average transaction amount of HK$20,700 and RMB 38,000 respectively.\n\nIn May of last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidelines for virtual bank licenses, prompting 33 institutions to submit applications. As of mid-April this year, four licenses have been granted, and they are expected to begin operations within the year. Virtual banks will help drive the development and innovation of financial technology in Hong Kong, providing new services and experiences for individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, and promoting financial inclusion.\n\nFurthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released the Open Application Programming Interface (OpenAPI) framework in July, under which banks will open up external interfaces for their products and services in four phases, fostering a more flexible and open financial technology environment. This will allow bank customers to more easily integrate account information, access information, and select services that meet their individual needs. Throughout the year, a total of 42 new technology products utilized the HKMA’s FinTech Regulatory Sandbox for testing, with 28 completing trials and their corresponding products and services successfully launched into the market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with several banks, officially launched \"TradeConnect\" last October. This trade finance platform, which utilizes \"distributed ledger technology,\" will enhance the efficiency of bank approval processes for trade finance. \"TradeConnect\" is currently undergoing testing to connect with related platforms in other regions, in order to facilitate cross-border trade finance activities.\n\nFinancial technology is not only widely applied in daily life, but has also recently entered the fields of compliance and regulation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages banks to utilize Regtech to assist in handling daily operations such as monitoring suspicious activities related to money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the HKMA is researching the use of Suptech to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory work.\n\n# Strengthening and enhancing financial strength.\n\nThe competition between international financial centers is a contest of soft power. We must continuously adapt to changes in the economic, social, and technological landscapes, seize opportunities, and constantly expand new development space for Hong Kong’s financial industry. Green finance represents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to develop its bond and project finance markets. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports and cooperates with the HKSAR Government in developing green finance. In addition to supporting the HKSAR Government’s preparation of a HK$100 billion government green bond issuance plan, we also hosted numerous green finance seminars last year, including two large-scale international conferences, to enhance market awareness, understanding, and participation in green finance, and to encourage issuing institutions to participate in the government’s green bond grant scheme and Hong Kong’s green finance certification services launched last year. The scale of green bonds issued in Hong Kong last year exceeded US$11 billion, more than three times that of 2017.\n\nIn recent years, the investment community has shown growing interest in infrastructure and related projects. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in 2016, and its network of partners has since more than doubled to 95 institutions, making it a key hub for infrastructure financing collaboration in the region. Last year, the HKMA and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) jointly held a high-level roundtable for the first time, discussing Hong Kong’s unique advantages and role in supporting the “going out” strategy of central state-owned enterprises, laying a solid foundation for future collaborative development opportunities between these enterprises and Hong Kong’s financial and professional services sectors.\n"}

{"zh":"# 金管局簡介\n\n香港金融管理局是香港的中央銀行機構，主要職能有4項：在聯繫匯率制度的架構內維持貨幣穩定；促進金融體系（包括銀行體系）的穩定與健全；協助鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，包括維持與發展香港的金融基建；以及管理外匯基金。\n\n# 金管局的法定授權\n\n立法會（前稱立法局）於1992年通過《外匯基金條例》修訂條文，授權財政司司長（前稱財政司）委任金融管理專員，金管局隨後在1993年4月1日成立。\n\n金融管理專員的權力、職能及責任由《外匯基金條例》、《銀行業條例》、《金融機構（處置機制）條例》、《存款保障計劃條例》、《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》及其他有關條例明文規定。財政司司長與金融管理專員於2003年6月25日的互換函件，列載彼此在貨幣與金融事務方面的職能與責任的分配，亦披露財政司司長將若干權力轉授金融管理專員。有關函件為公開文件，可於金管局網站查閱。\n\n外匯基金根據《外匯基金條例》設立，由財政司司長掌有控制權。該條例規定外匯基金須主要運用於影響港元匯價。財政司司長亦可運用外匯基金以保持香港貨幣金融體系的穩定與健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。\n\n金融管理專員根據《外匯基金條例》委任，以協助財政司司長執行其根據該條例獲授予的職能，以及執行其他條例及財政司司長所指派的職能。金融管理專員的辦公室稱為金管局，金融管理專員即為金管局總裁。\n\n金融管理專員根據《銀行業條例》賦予的職責及權力，規管及監管銀行業務與接受存款業務。根據《銀行業條例》，金融管理專員負責處理香港持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司的認可資格事宜。\n\n《金融機構（處置機制）條例》指定金融管理專員為銀行界實體的處置機制當局。該條例賦予金融管理專員一系列權力，對有關實體進行有秩序處置，以減低有關實體不可持續經營對香港金融體系的穩定及有效運作構成的風險。\n\n《證券及期貨條例》及《強制性公積金計劃條例》賦予金融管理專員若干有關銀行證券及強制性公積金業務的權力。\n\n《保險業條例》訂明可就銀行的保險業務向金融管理專員轉授查察及調查權力。\n\n《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》賦權金融管理專員監管銀行遵守該條例的規定。\n\n《存款保障計劃條例》授予金融管理專員責任，就存款保障計劃的運作提供協助，以及啟動從存款保障計劃基金向無力償付銀行的存款人發放補償。\n\n金融管理專員在《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》的法定架構下，可指定及監察對香港貨幣或金融穩定或對香港發揮作為國際金融中心的功能事關重要的結算及交收系統。該條例亦授權金融管理專員管理儲值支付工具發牌制度，及指定零售支付系統並監察該等系統的運作是否安全及有效率。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信心。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理社會上備受關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。此外，金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。金管局亦舉辦公眾教育活動，透過講座及資訊中心導賞服務，向公眾人士（特別是學生）講解金管局的工作，以及增進市民的金融知識。有關金管局的傳媒聯繫工作、刊物及公眾教育活動的詳細資料，見「機構職能」一章。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站亦載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表亦會不時出席立法會財經事務委員會及法案委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 諮詢委員會及其他委員會\n\n# 外匯基金諮詢委員會\n\n財政司司長行使外匯基金的控制權時，會聽取外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。外匯基金諮詢委員會根據《外匯基金條例》第3(1)條成立。該項條文訂明財政司司長行使對外匯基金的控制權時，須諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會的意見。財政司司長為外匯基金諮詢委員會的當然主席，其他委員（包括金融管理專員）則以個人身分，由財政司司長根據香港特別行政區行政長官的授權委任。委員因各具專業知識及經驗而獲委任，他們的加入讓外匯基金諮詢委員會廣受裨益。委員的專業知識及經驗涵蓋貨幣、金融、經濟、投資、會計、管理、商業及法律等範疇。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會下設5個專責委員會，負責監察金管局特定環節的工作，並透過外匯基金諮詢委員會向財政司司長報告及提出建議。外匯基金諮詢委員會在2018年共舉行5次會議，討論各項與金管局工作有關的事宜，其中大部分事項均由有關的專責委員會事先進行討論。\n\n管治委員會監察金管局的表現，以及就金管局薪酬與服務條件、人力資源政策、財政預算、行政及管治事務，向外匯基金諮詢委員會提出建議。該委員會在2018年共召開5次會議，內容涵蓋金管局的開支預算、表現評估、年度薪酬檢討及策略性規劃事宜。該委員會亦審議金管局定期提交的工作報告。\n\n審核委員會檢討金管局的財政匯報程序，並評核其內部管控制度是否足夠和有效，以及提交報告。審核委員會負責檢視金管局的財務報表，編製該等報表的組成項目與會計原則，並聯同外部及內部審計師查核其審計範疇與結果。審核委員會各委員在金管局並沒有任何行政職能。該委員會在2018年共召開2次會議，並審議風險委員會及內部審核處的工作報告。\n\n貨幣發行委員會監察貨幣發行局制度的運作，並匯報這個作為香港聯繫匯率制度支柱的情況。該委員會負責確保貨幣發行局制度按照既定政策運作、提出改進該制度的建議，以及確保該制度的運作維持高透明度。金管局定期公布貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄及提交該委員會的貨幣發行局制度運作報告。該委員會在2018年共召開4次會議。\n","en":"# Introduction to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the central banking institution of Hong Kong, with four primary functions: maintaining monetary stability under the linked exchange rate system; promoting the stability and soundness of the financial system (including the banking system); assisting in consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, including maintaining and developing Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure; and managing the Exchange Fund.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Statutory Authority\n\nThe Legislative Council (formerly the Legislative Council) passed amendments to the Exchange Fund Ordinance in 1992, authorizing the Financial Secretary (formerly the Colonial Secretary) to appoint the Chief Executive of the Exchange Fund. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was subsequently established on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe powers, functions, and responsibilities of the Financial Secretary are prescribed in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the Banking Ordinance, the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, the Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance, the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, and other relevant ordinances. A letter of exchange dated June 25, 2003, between the Financial Secretary and the Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury details the division of functions and responsibilities between them in respect of monetary and financial matters, and also discloses the delegation of certain powers by the Financial Secretary to the Financial Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury. This letter is a public document and is available for inspection on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Exchange Fund was established under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and is controlled by the Financial Secretary. The Ordinance stipulates that the Exchange Fund shall primarily be used for influencing the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary may also utilize the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial system of Hong Kong, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, in accordance with the Exchange Fund Ordinance, appoints a Financial Secretary for Exchange Fund to assist in exercising the functions conferred on him\/her under that Ordinance, as well as performing functions under other Ordinances and those assigned by the Financial Secretary. The office of the Financial Secretary for Exchange Fund is known as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the Financial Secretary for Exchange Fund is the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority regulates and supervises banking business and deposit-taking business under the powers conferred by the Banking Ordinance. Under the Banking Ordinance, the Chief Executive is responsible for matters relating to the authorization of licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution Regime) Ordinance designates the Financial Secretary as the resolution authority for banking entities. The Ordinance confers a range of powers on the Financial Secretary to carry out an orderly resolution of the relevant entity, to mitigate the risk that the entity’s unsustainable operations pose to the stability and effective functioning of the financial system of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance grant the Secretary for Financial Services certain powers relating to banking, securities and mandatory provident fund business.\n\nThe Insurance Ordinance stipulates that powers to inspect and investigate the insurance business of banks may be delegated by the Financial Secretary to the Commissioner of Insurance.\n\nThe Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Ordinance empowers the Secretary for Financial Services to supervise banks’ compliance with the Ordinance’s provisions.\n\nThe Deposit Protection Scheme Ordinance empowers the Financial Secretary to provide assistance with the operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme and to initiate the disbursement of compensation from the Deposit Protection Scheme Fund to depositors of banks that are unable to repay their debts.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, within the statutory framework of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, may designate and oversee settlement and clearing systems that are important to the currency of Hong Kong or to the financial stability of Hong Kong or to the functioning of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Ordinance also authorizes the Financial Secretary to administer the licensing regime for stored value facilities and to designate retail payment systems and to oversee their operation for safety and efficiency.\n\n# Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is part of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, but it is empowered to employ staff under terms of service different from those of civil servants in order to attract individuals with appropriate experience and specialist knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are all public officers. The day-to-day operations of the HKMA are highly autonomous within the scope of statutory powers delegated to or transferred to the Controller of Financial Services.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objectives and monetary system of Hong Kong. In a letter dated June 25, 2003, to the Commissioner of Financial Services, the Financial Secretary stipulated that monetary stability should be maintained through the currency board system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at around 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to 1 US dollar. The Commissioner of Financial Services is independently responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including deciding on the relevant strategies, tools, and methods of implementation, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of the Hong Kong monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, is responsible for maintaining the stability and soundness of the financial system in Hong Kong, as well as policies to preserve Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre. To implement these policies, the duties of the Commissioner for Financial Services include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and effective functioning of the banking system\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market\n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender notes and coins\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing and settlement systems, and operating such systems where appropriate\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong’s currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority shall be responsible to the Financial Secretary for the deployment and investment management of the Exchange Fund, as authorized by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe HKMA has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and the methods it employs to implement government policy objectives, while also ensuring a high level of accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to maintaining monetary and banking stability, effectively managing official reserves, and developing and supervising a robust and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre and promoting economic development.\n\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must secure the public’s trust. Therefore, the HKMA takes a rigorous approach to fulfilling its duty to explain its policies and operations to the public, and strives to handle matters of public concern that fall within its purview.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is appointed by the Financial Secretary, and therefore the HKMA is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary. Furthermore, as the HKMA’s powers are established by legislation passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. In addition, the HKMA recognizes its broader responsibility to promote public understanding of its role and objectives, and to closely monitor issues of public concern. In carrying out its day-to-day operations and maintaining extensive engagement with the community, the HKMA is committed to enhancing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure, to the extent possible while respecting statutory restrictions on the disclosure of market sensitivities, commercial confidences and confidential information, that the financial industry and the public are fully informed about the HKMA’s work;\n- To ensure that the HKMA remains attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public views.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency and maintains extensive contact with the media. It also publishes a variety of bilingual periodicals and special publications. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections listing economic research, statistical data, consumer information, and other topics, as well as publications, press releases, speeches, and briefing materials issued by the HKMA. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an information centre, comprising a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public for visits and use six days a week. The HKMA also organizes public education activities, delivering talks and guided tours of the information centre to explain the HKMA’s work to the public, particularly students, and to enhance financial literacy among citizens. Detailed information regarding the HKMA’s media relations, publications, and public education activities can be found in the chapter on “Functions and Responsibilities.”\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been progressively increasing the frequency and detail of its disclosure of information on the Exchange Fund and the Currency Board accounts. The HKMA joined the International Monetary Fund’s Central Bank Transparency Initiative – Special Data Dissemination Standard in 1999. The HKMA also publishes the minutes of meetings of the Currency Board, which is under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has also featured supervisory policies and guidelines for the banking sector.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Chief Executive has pledged to brief the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee three times a year on the HKMA’s work and policies, and to answer related inquiries. Furthermore, representatives of the HKMA will also attend meetings of the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee and Bills Committee from time to time to explain and discuss specific matters, and to assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Consultative Committee and Other Committees\n\n# Exchange Fund Advisory Committee\n\nThe Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury exercises control over the Exchange Fund in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is established under section 3(1) of the Exchange Fund Ordinance. That provision stipulates that the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury must consult the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee when exercising control over the Exchange Fund. The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury is the ex-officio chairman of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and other members (including the Commissioner for Financial Management) are appointed in their individual capacities by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury under the authorization of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Members are appointed for their respective professional knowledge and experience, which greatly benefits the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. Their expertise and experience cover areas such as currency, finance, economics, investment, accounting, management, commerce, and law.\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has five specialized subcommittees responsible for monitoring specific aspects of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work and reporting to and making recommendations to the Financial Secretary through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. In 2018, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee held a total of five meetings to discuss various matters relating to the work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, most of which were discussed beforehand by the relevant specialized subcommittees.\n\nThe Governance Committee oversees the performance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and provides recommendations to the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on the HKMA’s remuneration and conditions of service, human resources policies, financial budget, administrative and governance matters. The Committee held a total of five meetings in 2018, covering the HKMA’s expenditure budget, performance evaluation, annual remuneration review, and strategic planning. The Committee also reviewed the HKMA’s regular progress reports.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the HKMA’s financial reporting procedures and assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal control systems, and submits reports accordingly. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the financial statements of the HKMA, the components of those statements, and the accounting principles used, and for examining the scope and results of audits conducted jointly with external and internal auditors. Members of the Audit Committee do not hold any executive positions within the HKMA. The Committee held two meetings in 2018, during which it considered the work reports of the Risk Committee and the Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Currency Board Subcommittee monitors the operation of the Exchange Fund system and reports on its status as a cornerstone of the linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong. The Subcommittee is responsible for ensuring the system operates in accordance with established policies, proposing improvements to the system, and ensuring its operation maintains a high degree of transparency. The HKMA publishes the minutes of the Currency Board Subcommittee meetings and the reports on the operation of the Exchange Fund system submitted to the Subcommittee on a regular basis. The Subcommittee held four meetings in 2018.\n"}

With global economic growth expected to slow, Hong Kong’s economic growth is also projected to moderate in 2019.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real economic activity\n\nHong Kong’s economy continued to expand in 2018, though the year-on-year growth rate slowed gradually from 4.6% in the first quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter (Table 1), bringing the full-year growth rate down from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.0%. The weakening economic expansion reflected slower growth in local demand and the continued drag from net exports (Figure 1). Domestically, private consumption grew strongly in the first quarter but lost momentum thereafter, partly reflecting increased uncertainty arising from rising trade protectionism and the wealth effect of adjustments in local asset prices. Overall investment expenditure also slowed down as business confidence remained fragile. Externally, merchandise exports remained broadly stable in the first three quarters but deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter as US-China trade friction escalated. Merchandise imports also slowed down due to weaker export-driven demand. In contrast, service exports recorded faster full-year growth, partly benefiting from robust inbound tourism, while service imports maintained growth momentum due to increases in transport, commercial and other services. In net terms, the trade balance turned from a surplus in 2017 to a small deficit in 2018, weighing on local economic growth.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Item (Comparison with Previous Period)\n\nNote: The seasonally adjusted quarterly change in the total amount of locally fixed capital formation is not detailed.\nSource of data: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution to Real GDP Growth by Component\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Monetary Conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar generally weakened in 2018, primarily influenced by arbitrage activity stemming from the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. The weak-side convertibility undertakings were triggered in April, May, and August in particular, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to purchase Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars at the rate of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar, as stipulated by the linked exchange rate system (the Exchange Rate Mechanism). As designed under the linked exchange rate system, this resulted in a contraction of the monetary base, indicating a decrease in interbank liquidity. Coupled with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, this led to an overall increase in Hong Kong dollar interbank offered rates (HIBOR). Due to rising funding costs for the banking system, banks raised their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the increase in the US federal funds rate target range in late September. Regarding credit growth, the overall increase in bank lending slowed significantly from 16.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018, partly due to slower local economic growth and weaker external trade performance.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures increased slightly in 2018. Excluding the effect of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate rose from a low of 1.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018, but remained at a moderate level. Within this, the component for housing rentals increased at a faster pace, reflecting the impact of the earlier rise in newly signed private residential rentals (Figure 2). Broader analysis showed that nominal labour costs and commercial property rentals grew at a slightly faster pace, leading to more pronounced local cost pressures. Import price inflation also rose as inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major sources of imports increased.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labor market\n\nThe labor market conditions remained stable in 2018 (Figure 3). The unemployment rate decreased from 3.1% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2018, the lowest level since 1997. Unemployment rates fell in most major service industries, particularly significantly in the accommodation and food services sector. With further increases in total employment and private sector job vacancies, overall labor demand continued to strengthen, and the labor force participation rate also rose slightly. Amidst tightening labor market conditions, real wages and incomes increased further.\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Situation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a significant reversal in 2018. Driven by strong momentum in 2017, the Hang Seng Index rose to a historic high of 33,484 points in January 2018 (Figure 4). However, as major central banks tightened monetary policy, Sino-US trade friction escalated, and local economic growth slowed, investor concerns mounted, leading to a sharp reversal in market sentiment. The Hang Seng Index plummeted to a low of 24,586 points in October and closed the year at 25,846 points, down 13.6% from the previous year. Nevertheless, the average daily turnover increased from HK$88.2 billion in 2017 to HK$107.4 billion, and the total funds raised through initial public offerings in Hong Kong also increased substantially due to several listings of companies in the emerging and technology sectors.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\nSource: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market remained robust in the first half of 2018, but cooled down in the second half as the US-China trade friction intensified, global stock markets adjusted, and Hong Kong’s best lending rates rose. Overall property prices fell 9% from their peak between July and December, but still recorded a 2% increase for the entire year (Figure 4). Property transaction volume also decreased by 7% year-on-year to 57,247 units in 2018, due to a significant reduction in buying and selling activity in both the primary and secondary markets. Furthermore, affordability remained limited, with the price-to-income ratio and income leverage ratio standing at 17.0 and 75.7 respectively, both significantly higher than their long-term averages. On the other hand, non-residential property prices rose overall in 2018, but showed a slight decline towards the end of the year. For the entire year, both prices and rentals continued to increase, while rental yields remained low.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic Environment\n\nDue to the slowdown in global economic growth, Hong Kong’s economic growth is expected to moderate in 2019. In particular, with a challenging external environment, Hong Kong’s export performance is expected to remain under pressure. Domestically, while low unemployment and rising household income will continue to support private consumption, the pace of growth in private consumption is expected to slow, partly due to weakening consumer confidence and the wealth effect resulting from earlier asset price adjustments. Regarding fixed capital formation, while building and construction activity should grow steadily with the increase in housing supply, businesses may become more cautious about capital investment in the face of increased economic uncertainty. The government forecasts that the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate in 2019 will be between 2 and 3 percent, while the latest forecasts from private sector analysts average 2.3 percent growth.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nDue to a global growth slowdown, including in Hong Kong, easing external price pressures and local cost pressures are expected, and inflationary pressure is forecast to remain mild in 2019. Recently signed new residential rental contracts have fallen, which will also exert a downward pressure on inflation. The market consensus predicts an overall inflation rate of 2.2% for 2019, while the government expects a basic inflation rate of 2.5%. The labor market is expected to remain tight, underpinned by continued economic growth and a robust tourism industry. Private sector analysts predict the unemployment rate will remain at around 3% in 2019.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2019 was affected by uncertainties and risks including trade friction, the future direction of US monetary policy, mainland China’s economic performance, Brexit, and other geopolitical developments. Furthermore, should these uncertainties intensify and persist, market sentiment and business confidence could be significantly impacted, posing downward pressure on local asset markets and real economic activity.\n\nFurthermore, the residential property market is affected by numerous external and local factors, and its outlook remains unclear. Externally, the uncertainty surrounding Sino-US trade friction could impact market sentiment, economic prospects, and financial conditions, continuing to cast a shadow over the Hong Kong property market. Locally, while economic growth is slowing, employment and income growth remain relatively stable, which may support residential property demand. Hong Kong interest rates will, to some extent, depend on future policy rate changes in the United States, but the latter’s trajectory remains uncertain. In the long term, due to the increase in residential completions in recent years, coupled with the government’s commitment to increasing land and housing supply, the gap between housing supply and demand is expected to narrow.\n\n# Banking Sector Performance\n\nDespite increased external headwinds such as the US-China trade conflict, Brexit, and the normalization of interest rates – which intensified financial market volatility – the banking sector in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2018. The banking sector maintained robust capital and liquidity positions, and asset quality remained good. Rising interest rates led to wider net interest margins, significantly boosting bank profitability.\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nIn 2018, the banking system continued to grow steadily, with balance sheets expanding by 5.9%. Faced with continued economic uncertainties such as trade conflicts and interest rate hikes among major economies, corporations became more conservative in seeking new loans. Total loan growth slowed to 4.4% during the year, compared to 16.1% in 2017. This growth was driven by increases in loans used in Hong Kong (+6.5%) and loans used outside of Hong Kong (+2%). Conversely, trade finance declined by 7.6% due to the uncertain global trade environment. Growth in loans related to Mainland China also slowed from 17.5% in 2017 to 1.4% in 2018.\n\nThe total amount of debt securities held by the banking system remained at 22% of total assets at the end of 2018, the same as in 2017. As the majority of these debt securities were investment-grade bonds issued by the government and banks, related credit risk remained low.\n\nRegarding liabilities, total deposits increased by 5% in 2018, a slower pace of growth compared to the 8.7% increase in 2017. Anticipating continued interest rate hikes in the United States, some banks raised fixed deposit rates to attract depositors to convert current and savings accounts into fixed deposits, thereby locking in funds. The proportion of current and savings deposits to total deposits decreased from 57.4% in the previous year to 51.4% at the end of 2018, leading to an increase in funding costs. As the growth of total deposits outpaced that of total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down from 73% at the end of 2017 to 72.6% at the end of 2018 (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Loans and Deposits of the Banking System\n\n# Capital adequacy ratio\n\nThe banking sector maintains ample capital, indicating a strong capacity to absorb potential shocks. Capital ratios are at historical highs since the implementation of Basel III; the consolidated capital adequacy ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions rose from 19.1% at the end of 2017 to 20.3% at the end of 2018 (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Composite Capital Adequacy Ratio of Locally Registered and Approved Institutions\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio came into effect on January 1, 2018; this ratio is a non-risk-based regulation designed to limit excessive leverage accumulation within the banking system. At the end of 2018, the leverage ratio was 8.0%, significantly above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Aggregate Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Approved Institutions\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking system remains robust, reflecting its strong capacity to effectively withstand shocks from potential financial and economic pressures. Regarding short-term liquidity (covering funding over a one-month period), Category 1 institutions’ average Liquidity Coverage Ratio in the fourth quarter was 167.6%, significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 90% applicable in 2018. The average Net Stable Funding Ratio for Category 2 institutions was 54.3%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Figure 8).\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n2018年港元利率普遍上升，而港元現貨匯率則回軟，並貼近弱方兌換保證匯率的水平。儘管如此，港元外匯及貨幣市場運作仍然暢順有序。聯繫匯率制度是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，並繼續展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n在港元與美元負息差擴闊帶動套息活動的背景下，港元匯率自年初以來逐步轉弱。於4月12日，弱方兌換保證在2005年訂於7.85水平以來首度被觸發。全年計，弱方兌換保證在2018年合共被觸發27次，分別在4月被觸發13次，5月6次，以及8月8次。儘管如此，港元交易仍然暢順有序，港元匯率於4月中至9月中在弱方兌換保證匯率7.85附近徘徊（圖1）。其後港元匯率略為轉強，部分反映假期、季結及年結臨近，銀行同業流動性收緊，帶動部分套息交易平倉。同時，某程度上港元亦受到11月初股市氣氛好轉支持。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2018年全年正常運作。\n\n圖1 2018年市場匯率\n\n由於弱方兌換保證被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額由2017年底的12,268億港元，下降至2018年底的11,362億港元（圖2）。年內，金管局按照聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）的設計，應銀行要求於弱方兌換保證匯率7.85的水平，購入合共1,035億港元，總結餘因而由2017年底的1,798億港元下降至2018年底的764億港元。年內未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額沒有明顯變動。貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n於2018年底，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額為11,362億港元。\n\n圖2 2018年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n由於觸發弱方兌換保證後銀行同業流動性減少，以及市場預期美國加息，香港銀行同業拆息在2018年內普遍上升。受新股集資活動相關的資金需求增加及季節性流動資金需求帶動，短期銀行同業拆息更出現較大波幅（圖3）。整體而言，短期銀行同業拆息在2018年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。鑑於銀行體系資金成本上升，在9月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調後，銀行調高最優惠貸款利率12.5至25基點。\n\n因應年內美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍4次合共上調100基點，由1.25至1.50厘上調至2.25至2.50厘，基本利率於3月22日、6月14日、9月27日及12月20日合共上調100基點，由1.75厘上調至2.75厘。基本利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，以兩者中較高者為準。\n\n圖3 2018年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率折讓在首4個月擴大，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，其中12個月港元遠期匯率點子在4月中達到負620點子（圖4）。其後隨着港元與美元的負息差收窄，港元遠期匯率折讓略為縮小，然後在第4季再度擴大。整體而言，香港貨幣市場繼續正常運作。貼現窗借貸由2017年的103億港元增至2018年的402億港元。\n\n圖4 2018年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯匯制度自1983年實施以來，直是維持香港貨幣及金融穩定的重要基石；並在多次區內以至全球金融危機考驗下，展現其承受強大衝擊的能力。由於港元轉弱，作為聯匯制度設計一部分的弱方兌換保證於4月、5月及8月被多次觸發。資金流出港元，是香港利率正常化的必經過程，亦是聯匯制度下的正常運作。為增進各界對有關操作及聯匯制度機制的了解，金管局致力向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並展示香港金融體系應對衝擊的能力。政府亦堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場保持穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府的承擔，以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行2018年第四條磋商時，重申對聯匯制度的支持，並指出聯匯制度仍然是最適合香港的貨幣制度，是維持穩定的支柱，有助確保經濟持續增長、維持競爭力及促進龐大的金融服務業暢順運作。\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理，以及壓力測試結果，並維持對銀行的企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備承受衝擊的能力。銀行持有大量外匯基金票據及債券，可經貼現窗用作換取港元流動資金，為利率大幅波動的情況提供有效緩衝。金管局隨時準備透過調整外匯基金票據及債券的發行量以提供額外流動性，以應對資金可能急劇流出港元的情況。金管局亦提醒市民審慎管理市場及利率風險，並為可能出現的市場波動作好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2018年在107.8至109.9%之間上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於12月31日為109.9%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2018年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 貨幣發行委員會\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會（貨幣發行委員會）負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2018年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括多國央行聯合退出非常規貨幣政策對在香港的境外銀行美元貸款供應造成的潛在影響、港元貨幣需求的利率敏感度，以及聯匯制度自3項優化措施以來的運作機制及理論。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（研究中心）繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。過去4年，研究中心更着重政策方面的研究，從所舉辦的研討會及訪問學者計劃尤其可見一斑。一方面，研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策研究機構合作，聯合舉辦更多政策相關的研討會。另一方面，在2016年推出專題研究學者計劃，支持更多與金管局政策制定相關的研究項目。\n\n在2018年，研究中心合共邀請16位研究學者到訪，並發表了25份研究論文。年內研究中心亦舉辦了4場國際研討會：\n- 於1月舉行的「第9屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國房地產市場及其對經濟與金融穩定的影響」。研討會由研究中心、國務院發展研究中心市場經濟研究所及中國人民銀行金融研究所合辦，集中討論內地房地產市場相關的課題及風險。\n- 於10月舉行由金管局及國際結算銀行合辦的「匯率與貨幣政策框架」研討會。研討會為國際結算銀行於香港的亞太區辦事處成立20周年的慶祝活動之一，旨在探討匯率在貨幣政策框架中的角色。\n- 於11月舉行的「2018年中央銀行金融市場微結構的年度研討會」。研討會討論金融市場微結構理論研究、實證研究結果及近期發展相關的政策影響。\n- 於11月舉行由金管局、歐洲中央銀行及美國聯邦儲備委員會合辦的「中國經濟的新時代」中國專家網絡研討會。研討會討論內地經濟正面對的迫切問題及其對全球經濟的影響，並特別着重與中央銀行決策者相關的政策議題。這是中國專家網絡研討會首次在歐洲以外地區舉行。\n","en":"# Currency stability\n\nIn 2018, Hong Kong dollar interest rates generally rose while the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate softened, approaching the weak-side convertibility undertaking level. Nevertheless, the foreign exchange and monetary markets in Hong Kong continued to function smoothly and in an orderly manner. The linked exchange rate system remains the cornerstone of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong and continues to demonstrate its ability to withstand significant shocks.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is to maintain monetary stability, which means ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and keeping it trading within a range of 7.75 to 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar in the foreign exchange market. This monetary system primarily adopts a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100 percent backing for the monetary base; any changes in the monetary base must be matched by corresponding increases or decreases in the US dollar reserves, aligning with the percentage change in the monetary base.\n\nThe monetary base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of indebtedness (providing full backing for banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks)\n- Currency in circulation issued by the Government, including coins\n- The aggregate balances of banks’ clearing accounts held with the HKMA (i.e., total balances)\n- Exchange Fund bills and bonds issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to fulfilling the exchange rate guarantee. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the strong-side convertibility undertaking of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars to banks, increasing the aggregate balance and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back from the strong-side convertibility undertaking level to within the convertibility range of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the Hong Kong dollar is oversupplied, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weak-side convertibility undertaking of 7.85 Hong Kong dollars per 1 US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, reducing the aggregate balance and raising Hong Kong dollar interest rates, causing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return from the weak-side convertibility undertaking level to within the convertibility range.\n\n## 2018 Retrospective\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nAgainst the backdrop of widening interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar driving carry trade activity, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has gradually weakened since the beginning of the year. On April 12th, the weak-side convertibility undertaking was triggered for the first time since its establishment at the 7.85 level in 2005. Throughout the year, the weak-side convertibility undertaking was triggered a total of 27 times in 2018, including 13 times in April, 6 times in May, and 8 times in August. Nevertheless, Hong Kong dollar transactions remained smooth and orderly, with the exchange rate hovering around the weak-side convertibility undertaking rate of 7.85 from mid-April to mid-September (Figure 1). Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened slightly, partly reflecting tighter interbank liquidity as holidays, quarter-end, and year-end approached, prompting the unwinding of some carry trades. At the same time, the Hong Kong dollar was also, to some extent, supported by improved market sentiment in early November. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market functioned normally throughout 2018.\n\nFigure 1: 2018 Market Exchange Rates\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side convertibility undertaking, the aggregate balance and the total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds decreased from HK$1,226.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 (Figure 2). During the year, the HKMA, in accordance with the design of the linked exchange rate system (the Exchange Rate Mechanism), purchased a total of HK$103.5 billion at the weak-side convertibility undertaking rate of 7.85 in response to banks’ requests, resulting in the aggregate balance decreasing from HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017 to HK$764 billion at the end of 2018. The total amount of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds remained broadly unchanged during the year. The monetary base continued to be fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the balance totaled HK$113.62 billion, representing the sum of outstanding Exchange Fund bills and bonds.\n\nFigure 2: Summary of Reserves and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds in 2018\n\n# Money Market\n\nDue to the triggering of weak-side currency exchange guarantees leading to a reduction in interbank liquidity in Hong Kong, coupled with market expectations of US interest rate hikes, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally rose throughout 2018. Short-term HIBOR experienced larger fluctuations, driven by increased funding demand related to initial public offerings and seasonal liquidity needs (Figure 3). Overall, short-term HIBOR remained largely below the prime rate level in 2018. Given the rising cost of funds for the banking system, banks increased their prime lending rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points following the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late September.\n\nIn response to the Federal Funds Rate target range being raised four times by a cumulative 100 basis points within the year, from 1.25 to 1.50 percent to 2.25 to 2.50 percent, the base rate was raised by a cumulative 100 basis points on March 22, June 14, September 27, and December 20, increasing from 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. The adjustments to the base rate were made according to the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. Under that formula, the base rate is set at the lower limit of the US Federal Funds Rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the average of the five-day moving average of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), whichever is higher.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) in 2018\n\nThe discount on Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rates widened in the first four months, largely following the trend of the interest rate spread between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching negative 620 points in mid-April (Figure 4). Subsequently, as the negative interest rate spread between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar narrowed, the discount on Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rates narrowed slightly before widening again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hong Kong money market continued to function normally. Discount window lending increased from HK$10.3 billion in 2017 to HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\nFigure 4: US Dollar\/Hong Kong Dollar Forward Exchange Rate Quotes in 2018\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe linked exchange rate system, in place since 1983, has consistently been a vital cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and has demonstrated its ability to withstand significant shocks during numerous regional and global financial crises. The weak-side convertibility undertaking, an integral part of the linked exchange rate system, was triggered multiple times in April, May, and August due to the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar. Capital outflows from the Hong Kong dollar are a necessary step in the normalization of Hong Kong interest rates and represent normal operation under the linked exchange rate system. To enhance public understanding of these operations and the mechanisms of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to explaining the technical details of the system and demonstrating the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the linked exchange rate system. Maintaining stability in the foreign exchange and monetary markets will further consolidate public confidence in the government’s commitment and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payment and store of value. The International Monetary Fund, during its 2018 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, reaffirmed its support for the linked exchange rate system, noting that it remains the most suitable monetary system for Hong Kong, a pillar of stability, and contributes to sustained economic growth, competitiveness, and the smooth operation of its large financial services sector.\n\nGiven the critical role of a sound banking system in the smooth functioning of the linked exchange rate system, the HKMA continues to closely monitor banks’ credit, liquidity and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of stress tests, and maintains regulation of banks’ corporate, property-related and Mainland-related lending to ensure the banking system’s resilience to shocks. Banks hold a substantial amount of Exchange Fund bills and bonds, which can be discounted through the discount window to obtain Hong Kong dollar liquidity, providing an effective buffer against significant interest rate volatility. The HKMA stands ready to adjust the issuance of Exchange Fund bills and bonds at any time to provide additional liquidity in response to potential large-scale capital outflows from Hong Kong dollars. The HKMA also reminds the public to manage market and interest rate risks prudently and to prepare for potential market turbulence.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets has been designated to back the monetary base since October 1998. The backing ratio (i.e., the ratio of backing assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 107.8% and 109.9% in 2018, without reaching either the upper or lower limit. The ratio was 109.9% as of December 31 (Figure 5). Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, while certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the backing portfolio, the entire assets of the Exchange Fund are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources provide a strong backing for safeguarding monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong when faced with sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily Fluctuation of Support Rate in 2018\n\n# Currency Issuance Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Subcommittee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (Currency Board) is responsible for monitoring and examining issues relating to Hong Kong’s currency and financial stability. In 2018, the issues examined by the Currency Board included the potential impact on the supply of US dollar loans from foreign banks in Hong Kong resulting from the coordinated exit of unconventional monetary policies by multiple central banks, the interest rate sensitivity of demand for Hong Kong dollars, and the operational mechanisms and theories of the Linked Exchange Rate System since the implementation of three enhancement measures. Minutes of the Currency Board meetings and the reports on the operation of the monetary authority system submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (the Institute) continues to support research in monetary policy, banking, and finance. Over the past four years, the Institute has placed greater emphasis on policy-oriented research, as evidenced particularly by the seminars it has hosted and its visiting scholars program. On one hand, the Institute has collaborated with major central banks and policy research institutions to jointly organize more policy-related seminars. On the other hand, it launched a dedicated Visiting Research Scholar Scheme in 2016 to support more research projects relevant to the HKMA’s policymaking.\n\nIn 2018, the research center invited a total of 16 research scholars for visits and published 25 research papers. The research center also hosted four international seminars throughout the year:\n- The “9th China Economic Annual International Seminar,” held in January, focused on “The Impact of the Chinese Property Market on Economic and Financial Stability.” Co-organized by the research center, the Institute of Market Economy Research of the State Council Development Research Center, and the Financial Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China, the seminar concentrated on issues and risks related to the mainland’s property market.\n- The seminar on “Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy Frameworks,” held in October, was co-hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements. This seminar was part of the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of the Bank for International Settlements’ Asia-Pacific Office in Hong Kong, and aimed to explore the role of exchange rates in monetary policy frameworks.\n- The “2018 Annual Seminar on Central Bank Financial Market Microstructure,” held in November, discussed theoretical research, empirical findings, and recent developments related to policy implications in financial market microstructure.\n- The “China Experts Network Seminar on China’s New Era,” held in November, was co-hosted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the European Central Bank, and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球經濟及金融市場的不確定性增加，2018年香港銀行體系維持穩健。認可機構的流動性及信用風險管理制度的成效繼續是金管局年內的監管重點。鑑於網絡威脅持續增加，以及銀行業更廣泛使用金融科技，金管局加強對認可機構科技風險管理及業務操作恢復能力的監管。金管局亦於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並開始處理虛擬銀行認可申請。在操守監管方面，金管局採取進一步措施，加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法、促進為殘疾人士提供無障礙銀行服務，以及推動以客為本的企業文化。\n\n隨着金融罪行越趨複雜及全球化，金管局繼續借助新科技及風險為本方法，加強香港打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力。金管局在香港落實國際監管標準方面進展理想，其中包括資本充足標準、披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險承擔限額。此外，金管局亦加強與銀行業的溝通接觸，確保在監管成效與市場發展兩者間取得適當平衡。\n\n與此同時，金管局繼續致力確保香港備有具公信力的認可機構處置機制，其中包括推出最低吸收虧損能力規定的規則，以解決認可機構處置可行性面對的一大障礙。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因其營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊、對危機作出應對，並自危機中恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。金融管理專員亦負責某些金融市場基建的指定及監管。\n\n然而，金融管理專員不能確保金融體系全無風險，香港的審慎監管制度亦非為了確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，即能有序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員於該機制之下作為包括認可機構在內的若干金融機構的處置機制當局。為建立運作暢順的香港處置機制，必須制定處置法例及政策標準、進行處置規劃以清除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置無法經營的認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局需要採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2018年共進行187次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務操作及風險管理，以及認可機構應對金融科技發展的業務策略。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局或董事局轄下委員會共舉行27次會議，並跟進認可機構實施企業管治指引的進度。此外，金管局與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行28次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為較高風險的範疇。金管局於年內共進行392次現場審查及專題評估，並繼續以信用風險管理作為審查與評估的主要重點。其他重點為科技風險及業務操作風險管理，以及打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施。金管局亦增加針對流動性與市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足架構的實施情況的現場審查及專題評估次數。專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2018年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2018年信貸增長放緩，全年貸款總額增加4.4%，2017年的增幅則為16.1%（表2）。貿易融資於2018年減少7.6%。貸款增長放緩，主要是因為全球經濟及貿易環境越趨不明朗，以致信貸需求收縮。\n\n表2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2018年底增加1.4%至42,490億港元，低於2017年的增幅（表3）。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n認可機構的資產質素在2018年維持穩健。零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2017年底的0.56%下降至2018年底的0.50%，遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.1%；同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率則由0.68%下降至0.55%。內地相關貸款方面，零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由0.75%下降至2018年的0.63%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.67%下降至0.54%。\n\n年內金管局加強監管，確保認可機構繼續採取審慎的信用風險管理準則。尤其金管局更主動了解大型企業的背景及結構，從而加強企業信用風險的監察制度。此外，金管局亦進行以主要信用風險管理監控措施為重點的專題評估，例如大型企業貸款的批核準則及風險管理、貸款分類及撥備制度、信用風險管治架構、地產發展商貸款的風險管理、有抵押貸款及保單抵押貸款等。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n住宅物業價格在2018年7月到達歷史高位，但在下半年出現緩和跡象。金管局自2009年10月以來推出的8輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已增強香港銀行體系應對本港樓市可能逆轉的抵禦能力。新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數由2009年9月金管局推出首輪逆周期措施前的64%，降至2018年12月的46%。平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時的41%，降至2018年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖1 新造住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n銀行業面對的科技風險仍然偏高。金管局於2016年推出「網絡防衛評估框架」。第一期實施安排涵蓋包括所有大型銀行在內的30間認可機構，該等認可機構已完成3個階段的評估，即自身風險程度評估、成熟程度評估及（如適用）風險資訊主導網絡攻防模擬測試。有關評估有助認可機構查找需要改進的運作範疇及採取補救措施，加強網絡防衛。與此同時，金管局已制定第二及第三期實施安排的時間表，這兩期實施安排將涵蓋其餘認可機構。年內金管局進行現場審查，集中檢視認可機構的網絡保安管控措施、外判安排及資訊科技管治。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n金管局繼續就2017年9月公布的7項推動智慧銀行的措施與銀行業合作，以促進金融科技在香港的發展。在監管層面，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本。此外，金管局在「銀行易」措施下，已經精簡有關遙距開戶、網上貸款及網上財富管理的監管要求。這些優化的監管要求有助銀行提供更佳的網上銀行用戶體驗。「銀行易」措施的工作範疇在9月擴大至促進銀行採用金融合規科技(Regtech)，而當中3個新的工作重點包括打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監察科技、用於審慎風險管理和合規的金融合規科技，以及「機器可讀」的監管要求。\n\n金管局副總裁阮國恒先生在香港銀行學會主辦的「香港銀行家峰會2018」上發表演辭，題為「智慧銀行新紀元下的金融合規科技」。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險的監管\n\n隨着美國貨幣政策持續正常化，金管局加強了流動性風險的監管，以確保認可機構審慎及有效地管理其流動性風險。年內金管局進行了一輪專題評估，以評估認可機構為美元流動性可能收緊所作的準備，以及其內部流動性壓力測試的能力。此外，金管局亦監察認可機構遵守於1月生效的「穩定資金淨額比率」要求的情況。\n\n金管局除檢視認可機構的債券組合的市場風險管理外，亦進行了針對《環球外匯守則》及非中央結算場外衍生工具的保證金和風險緩解標準的專題現場審查，以審視認可機構在財資業務中遵行新國際標準的情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n政府於4月發表的《香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估報告》指出，香港銀行體系面對高洗錢威脅，這與其他國際金融中心一樣，亦反映金融服務日趨全球化及複雜。香港面對的洗錢威脅除源自本地犯罪活動外，在更大程度上也來自境外活動。該等境外活動包括來自境外貪污活動的非法得益、跨國犯罪集團的詐騙活動、逃稅及基於香港作為支付及貿易樞紐的地位而引致與制裁相關的風險。在金管局協助下，政府制定打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策聲明，列載對該等威脅的回應，目標是在提高打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度的應對能力的同時，又能吸引及便利正當企業。\n\n《2018年打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於3月1日生效，引入的修訂包括在核實客戶身分方面賦予靈活性，以配合認可機構利用科技方便客戶開戶的發展。新法例亦擴大適用範圍，規定律師、會計師、地產代理及信託或公司服務提供者須負上打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的責任，從而全面強化打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度。該等修訂連同《公司條例》為提高企業實益擁有權透明度而作出的修訂，有助認可機構執行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。\n\n為鞏固及進一步強化與認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集政策與監管方法的溝通，金管局在10月發出《監管政策手冊》下的全新單元「打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的監管方法」，及配合相關法例修訂的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引（認可機構適用）》，以能更有效實施風險為本的方法，並減少認可機構就打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度採用新科技的障礙。\n\n資訊交流在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度中的作用日見重要；在金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）的支持下，銀行業積極參與反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組（情報工作組），並已取得實質成果。有關情報工作組先導計劃的檢討工作於2018年末展開，並會於2019年初完成。\n","en":"# Banking system stable.\n\nDespite increased global economic and financial market uncertainties, the banking system in Hong Kong remained resilient in 2018. The effectiveness of liquidity and credit risk management systems at authorized institutions continued to be a key regulatory focus for the HKMA throughout the year. Given the continuing rise in cyber threats and the banking sector’s wider adoption of financial technology, the HKMA strengthened its supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management and business operations recovery capabilities. The HKMA also issued a revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks in May and began processing applications for virtual bank authorization. In conduct regulation, the HKMA took further steps to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products, promote accessible banking services for people with disabilities, and foster a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nAs financial crimes become increasingly complex and globalized, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to leverage new technologies and a risk-based approach to enhance Hong Kong’s capabilities in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards in Hong Kong, including those relating to capital adequacy, disclosure, liquidity, and large exposure limits. In addition, the HKMA has strengthened communication and engagement with the banking sector to ensure an appropriate balance between regulatory effectiveness and market development.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA continues to be committed to ensuring that Hong Kong has a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including the introduction of rules regarding the minimum requirement for loss absorption capacity, to address a major obstacle to the feasibility of resolving authorized institutions.\n\n# Objectives\n\nOne of the HKMA’s overarching objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal crucially depends on establishing and maintaining a highly resilient financial system capable of providing essential financial services for the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the banking system through their operational practices, or even through disorderly failure in extreme circumstances. As the regulator, the Financial Secretary plays a vital role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are able to withstand shocks, respond to crises, and recover from them, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Financial Secretary is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the authorization of licensed banks, restricted license banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as “authorized institutions”). The Financial Secretary is also responsible for the designation and regulation of certain financial market infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the Financial Secretary cannot guarantee a risk-free financial system, nor is Hong Kong’s prudential regulatory regime designed to ensure “zero risk.” As one of the resolution authorities, the Financial Secretary strives to ensure that, should a recognized institution become non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution regime, under which the Financial Secretary acts as the resolution authority for certain financial institutions, including recognized institutions. To establish a smoothly functioning resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is essential to develop resolution laws and policy standards, conduct resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of recognized institutions, and build the HKMA’s operational capabilities to resolve non-viable recognized institutions. To effectively carry out this work, the HKMA needs to adopt approaches that are consistent with and coordinated with international standards.\n\n## 2018 Retrospective\n\n# Regulatory Oversight Overview\n\nIn 2018, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) conducted a total of 187 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings of authorized institutions, corporate governance, business operations and risk management, as well as the business strategies of authorized institutions in response to the development of financial technology. To further strengthen the risk governance of authorized institutions, the HKMA held a total of 27 meetings with the boards of directors or board committees of authorized institutions, and followed up on the progress of their implementation of corporate governance guidelines. In addition, the HKMA held 28 tripartite meetings with authorized institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site review work, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site inspections, supplemented by targeted assessments to examine areas identified as higher risk. The HKMA conducted a total of 392 on-site inspections and targeted assessments during the year, continuing to focus primarily on credit risk management. Other key areas of focus were technology risk and operational risk management, as well as controls to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site inspections and targeted assessments relating to liquidity and market risk management, and the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. Specialist inspection teams also conducted on-site inspections of authorized institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) related business.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s regulatory work in 2018.\n\n# Credit Risk Regulation\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality.\n\nCredit growth slowed in 2018, with total loan volume increasing by 4.4% for the year, compared to a growth rate of 16.1% in 2017 (Table 2). Trade finance decreased by 7.6% in 2018. The slowdown in loan growth was primarily due to increasing uncertainty in the global economic and trade environment, leading to a contraction in credit demand.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nMainland-related loan balances increased by 1.4% to HK$424.9 billion at the end of 2018, lower than the growth rate in 2017 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Growth of Related Loans in Mainland China\n\nThe asset quality of accredited institutions remained sound in 2018. The specific classification loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.56% at the end of 2017 to 0.50% at the end of 2018, significantly lower than the long-term average of 2.1% since 2000; during the same period, the overall banking sector’s specific classification loan ratio fell from 0.68% to 0.55%. Regarding loans related to the Mainland, the specific classification loan ratio for retail banks decreased from 0.75% to 0.63% in 2018, and the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also decreased from 0.67% a year earlier to 0.54%.\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened its supervision to ensure that authorized institutions continue to adopt prudent credit risk management practices. In particular, the HKMA has taken a more proactive approach to understanding the background and structure of large corporations, thereby enhancing the monitoring system for corporate credit risk. Furthermore, the HKMA conducted targeted assessments focusing on key credit risk management monitoring measures, such as the approval criteria and risk management for large corporate loans, loan classification and provisioning systems, credit risk governance frameworks, risk management of loans to property developers, as well as mortgage loans and insurance policy-backed loans.\n\n# Property Mortgage Loan\n\nResidential property prices reached a historical high in July 2018, but showed signs of easing in the second half of the year. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority since October 2009 have strengthened the resilience of the Hong Kong banking system to a potential reversal in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for new mortgage loans decreased from 64% in September 2009, before the first round of countercyclical measures were launched by the HKMA, to 46% in December 2018. The average debt-to-income ratio also decreased from 41% when the ratio cap was first introduced in August 2010, to 34% in December 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average Loan-to-Value Ratio and Debt-to-Income Ratio for Newly Constructed Home Mortgages\n\n# Operational and Technological Risk Oversight\n\nThe technological risks facing the banking sector remain relatively high. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the “Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework” in 2016. The first phase of implementation covered 30 authorized institutions, including all large banks, which have completed a three-stage assessment: self-risk assessment, maturity assessment, and (where applicable) risk-informed cyber attack simulation exercises. These assessments help authorized institutions identify areas for improvement and take remedial actions to strengthen their cyber defenses. Simultaneously, the HKMA has established a timeline for the second and third phases of implementation, which will cover the remaining authorized institutions. This year, the HKMA will conduct on-site examinations focusing on authorized institutions’ cybersecurity control measures, outsourcing arrangements, and IT governance.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with the banking sector on the seven initiatives to promote smart banking announced in September 2017, in order to foster the development of financial technology in Hong Kong. On the regulatory front, the HKMA issued a revised version of the “Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks” in May. Furthermore, under the “Commercial Data Interchange” (CDI) initiative, the HKMA has streamlined regulatory requirements relating to remote account opening, online lending, and online wealth management. These optimized regulatory requirements help banks provide a better online banking user experience. In September, the scope of the CDI initiative was expanded to promote the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) by banks, with three new key areas of focus including surveillance technology to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, Regtech for prudent risk management and compliance, and “machine-readable” regulatory requirements.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Deputy Chief Executive Ruan Guohang delivered a speech at the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers’ “Hong Kong Bankers’ Summit 2018” titled “Financial Compliance Technology in the New Era of Smart Banking.”\n\n# Regulation of Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nAs the US monetary policy continues to normalize, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened its oversight of liquidity risk to ensure that authorized institutions prudently and effectively manage their liquidity risk. Throughout the year, the HKMA conducted a targeted assessment to evaluate the preparations made by authorized institutions for potential tightening of US dollar liquidity, as well as their internal liquidity stress testing capabilities. In addition, the HKMA also monitored authorized institutions’ compliance with the “Net Stable Funding Ratio” requirements that took effect in January.\n\nThe HKMA reviewed the market risk management of recognized institutions’ bond portfolios and also conducted on-site inspections focusing on margin and risk mitigation standards for the Global Code of Conduct and over-the-counter derivatives not centrally cleared, to assess recognized institutions’ compliance with new international standards in their treasury operations.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing\n\nThe Government’s “Hong Kong Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report” published in April points out that the banking system in Hong Kong faces a high threat of money laundering, a situation shared with other international financial centers and reflecting the increasing globalization and complexity of financial services. The money laundering threats facing Hong Kong stem not only from local criminal activities, but to a greater extent, from overseas activities. These overseas activities include illicit proceeds from foreign corruption, fraudulent activities by transnational criminal groups, tax evasion, and risks related to sanctions arising from Hong Kong’s position as a payment and trade hub. With the assistance of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Government has formulated a policy statement on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, outlining responses to these threats, with the aim of enhancing the system’s ability to counter money laundering and terrorist financing while also attracting and facilitating legitimate business.\n\nThe 2018 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Ordinance came into effect on March 1st, introducing amendments including providing flexibility in customer due diligence to accommodate the development of authorized institutions utilizing technology to facilitate customer account opening. The new legislation also broadens its scope, requiring lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and trust or company service providers to take on the responsibility of combating money laundering and terrorist financing, thereby comprehensively strengthening the system for countering these activities. These amendments, together with the amendments made to the Companies Ordinance to enhance the transparency of beneficial ownership of companies, will assist authorized institutions in carrying out their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing work.\n\nTo consolidate and further strengthen communication with recognized institutions regarding policies and regulatory approaches to combatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a new module under its “Supervisory Policy Manual” in October, titled “Regulatory Approaches to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing,” along with revised “Guidance on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (for Recognized Institutions)” to align with relevant legislative amendments. These measures aim to more effectively implement a risk-based approach and reduce obstacles for recognized institutions in adopting new technologies for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing systems.\n\nThe role of information exchange in combating money laundering and terrorist financing is increasingly important. With the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), the banking sector is actively participating in the Anti-Deception and Money Laundering Intelligence Working Group (the Intelligence Working Group), and has already achieved substantial results. A review of the pilot program for the Intelligence Working Group commenced at the end of 2018 and will be completed in early 2019.\n"}
{"zh":"# 香港的國際金融中心地位\n\n鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位是金管局主要職責之一。旨在促進銀行及支付業界開發與應用金融科技的7項措施，於年內取得良好進展，最佳例子是快速支付系統「轉數快」成功推出。\n\n中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃推出優化措施，以及粵港澳大灣區的發展，令香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位亦更為穩固，本港人民幣金融活動蓬勃發展。\n\n與此同時，金管局致力開拓新機遇，進一步提升香港金融平台的競爭力，包括基建融資、企業財資中心及綠色債券市場。金管局亦加強向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港優勢的市場推廣計劃。在國際層面，金管局於多個區內及國際委員會扮演領導角色，明確體現了香港在相關國際工作的專業知識及承擔。\n\n# 概覽\n\n為加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位，金管局致力落實於2017年9月公布、旨在促進銀行及支付行業開發與應用金融科技的7項措施。該7項推動智慧銀行的措施於年內取得的主要進展包括：\n\n- 成功推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，全面接通不同銀行及儲值支付工具（統稱「電子錢包」）\n- 發布銀行業開放應用程式介面（開放API）框架及促進業界落實開放API；\n- 提升金融科技研究及人才培訓；\n- 加強跨境金融科技合作；\n- 修訂《虛擬銀行的認可》指引，並處理虛擬銀行牌照申請；\n- 「金融科技監管沙盒」升級版（FSS 2.0）運作順暢；及\n- 擴展「銀行易」以促進銀行採用金融合規科技。\n\n金管局轄下金融科技促進辦公室(FFO)，聯同金管局各銀行部門在推動落實上述措施方面擔當重要角色。\n\n隨着中國內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通計劃優化措施的落實，香港作為進入中國內地主要門戶的獨特地位進一步加強。「債券通」全面實施即時貨銀兩訖(DvP)結算模式及國務院宣布境外投資者投資中國境內債券市場的稅務寛免安排，進一步提升計劃的效率及吸引力。金管局亦與內地當局緊密合作，探討及實施多項金融配套措施，便利在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）生活、工作及營商的個人和企業。香港離岸人民幣業務繼續蓬勃發展，人民幣存款資金池全年上升6%至6,577億元人民幣；人民幣即時支付結算(RTGS)系統平均每日交易額達到10,101億元人民幣的高水平。\n\n金管局積極開拓進一步提升香港金融平台競爭力的新機會。為促進香港債券市場的發展，金管局落實《財政預算案》所提出的「債券資助先導計劃」，為首次在香港發行債券的機構提供資助，並與政府緊密合作修訂法例，擴大「合資格債務票據計劃」下可獲稅務豁免的債券投資收入範圍。金管局亦加強市場推廣活動，向海外及內地持份者宣傳香港的優勢，包括舉辦多項大型及專題外展活動推廣香港為綠色金融、基建融資及企業財資中心樞紐。\n\n在國際層面，金管局領導多個區內及國際委員會。金管局現正擔任金融穩定理事會轄下監管合作常設委員會主席、巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）轄下監管及實施準則小組，以及東亞及太平洋地區中央銀行會議(EMEAP) 轄下金融市場工作小組主席。\n\n香港金融基建的安全及有效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心的地位奠定穩固基礎。處理銀行同業交易的4個RTGS系統、債務工具中央結算系統（CMU系統）及香港交易資料儲存庫（香港儲存庫）在2018年達到100%的系統可供使用率，高於99.95%的目標水平。透過於內地兩個中央證券託管機構的帳戶，CMU系統繼續協助結算「債券通」北向通交易，以及替相關CMU系統成員持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進零售支付業的整體安全及效率，金管局於8月根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）指定多兩個零售支付系統，使其運作受到金管局監察。迄今受金管局監察的指定零售支付系統增至6個。金管局亦對16個儲值支付工具持牌人進行監管。有關持牌人積極推出新產品及服務，致力為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。與此同時，電子支票與電子帳單及繳費服務涵蓋範圍，進一步擴展至包括香港與整個廣東省的跨境支付交易。\n\n# 2018年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技樞紐\n\n# 推動智慧銀行的措施\n\n金管局於2017年9月公布7項推動智慧銀行的措施，旨在協助銀行業提升至更高層次，並把握銀行與科技結合帶來的龐大機遇。金管局於年內在落實這些措施及為香港金融生態轉型方面，進展良好。\n\n# 「轉數快」\n\n「轉數快」於9月成功啟動，方便銀行及儲值支付工具用戶隨時隨地進行港元及人民幣的跨行即時資金轉帳，用戶只需輸入收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址。共有21間銀行（包括大部分零售銀行）及10間儲值支付工具營運商已加入該系統，為客戶提供即時支付服務及╱或帳戶綁定服務。\n\n「轉數快」在3.5個月內已接獲超過200萬個登記，相對香港人口比例27%。該系統自推出以來處理超過480萬宗交易，涉及總額逾1,049億港元及27.5億元人民幣。\n\n金管局於同月推出香港零售支付共用二維碼標準及相關流動應用程式「香港共用二維碼」(HKQR)，是全球首創將多個二維碼整合成為個綜合二維碼的流動應用程式，方便商戶尤其中小企以同一個二維碼接受不同支付服務營運商的支付方案，無需向客戶展示多個二維碼。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API是指透過向第三方服務供應商開放銀行的相關數據，更好更方便地融合銀行與其他行業的服務。用家單用一個系統就能在安全環境下享受綜合服務。為促進銀行界研發及提供開放API，金管局於7月發布開放API框架。該框架採用風險為本原則，並分4個階段落實各項開放API功能。截至2019年1月底，20間銀行已開放第一階段約500個開放API接口，涵蓋逾1,000項產品及服務的資料。\n\n# 科研及人才培訓\n\n建基於金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證成果由香港多間銀行組成的聯盟於10月啟動以分布式分類帳技術(DLT)為基礎的貿易融資平台「貿易聯動」。該平台旨在透過數碼化貿易文件及自動化貿易融資流程，減低失誤及詐騙風險。截至2018年底，已有12間銀行加入成為該聯盟成員。「貿易聯動」與歐洲貿易融資平台「we.trade」於10月簽署《諒解備忘錄》，進行對接雙方平台的概念驗證。金管局亦同步探討「貿易聯動」與其他地區對接的機會，包括與新加坡金融管理局合作推出「全球貿易連接網絡」。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左）於「貿易聯動」啟動儀式上。\n\n為培育更多金融科技專才，金管局於1月與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作推出「金融科技人才培育計劃」升級版(FCAS 2.0)。FCAS 2.0設有4個項目，適合處於不同職涯發展階段的年輕人才。計劃下有200多名學生受惠。\n\n金管局總裁陳德霖先生（左二）與數碼港主席林家禮博士（左一）、香港應科院主席王明鑫先生（右二）及香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強先生（右一）出席FCAS 2.0啟動儀式。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n繼於2017年與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（深圳金融辦）簽署《諒解備忘錄》後，金管局繼續加強與深圳的金融科技合作。當中包括金管局贊助「深圳金融科技暑期實習計劃」，讓50名學生到深圳多間著名公司進行為期6星期的實習，體驗當地的金融科技生態；另與深圳金融辦第二次合辦「深港金融科技創新獎」。\n\n金管局副總裁李達志先生（右二）與首批深圳金融科技暑期實習生交談。\n\n金管局亦於2018年與瑞士金融市場監督管理局、波蘭金融監管局、阿布扎比國際金融中心金融服務監管局及巴西中央銀行簽署金融科技合作協議，促進金融科技合作。\n\n在8月，金管局與11間金融監管當局和相關機構公布「全球金融創新網絡」計劃。該網絡旨在為創新型公司提供更有效方式與監管機構進行互動，並促進監管機構之間就創新相關議題的合作。\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n引入虛擬銀行將會為香港金融科技應用增添新動力，並為數碼銀行客戶帶來嶄新體驗。虛擬銀行以個人或中小企等零售客戶為對象，因此亦有助促進普及金融。經公眾諮詢，金管局於5月發出《虛擬銀行的認可》指引修訂本，並於8月底接獲約30宗申請。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n年內沙盒的使用穩步上升。為協助建立金融合規科技的生態系統，沙盒於9月起開放予金融合規科技的項目。\n\n截至2018年底，共有42項金融科技或科技產品獲准使用沙盒進行測試，其中28項已完成試行，有關產品亦已於其後推出市場。金管局另接獲220項使用「金融科技監管聊天室」的個案，希望在金融科技項目構思初期取得監管反饋意見。其中有約70%的個案來自科技公司。\n","en":"# Hong Kong's status as an international financial center.\n\nConsolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre is one of the HKMA’s primary responsibilities. Seven initiatives aimed at promoting the development and application of financial technology by the banking and payments industries have made good progress this year, with the successful launch of the Faster Payment System “Faster Payments” being a prime example.\n\nThe optimization measures for the mutual market access programs between Mainland China and Hong Kong, along with the development of the Greater Bay Area, have further strengthened Hong Kong’s unique position as a key gateway to Mainland China. Hong Kong’s status as a global offshore RMB business hub has also been solidified, with vibrant RMB financial activity in the city.\n\nAt the same time, the HKMA is committed to exploring new opportunities and further enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure financing, corporate treasury centers, and the green bond market. The HKMA is also strengthening its marketing efforts to promote Hong Kong’s advantages to stakeholders both overseas and on the Mainland. On the international front, the HKMA plays a leading role in various regional and international committees, clearly demonstrating Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment in related international work.\n\n# Overview\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a leading FinTech hub in Asia, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is committed to implementing the seven measures announced in September 2017 to promote the development and application of financial technology by the banking and payments industries. Key progress made this year on the seven initiatives to promote smart banking includes:\n\nSuccessfully launched the fast payment system “Faster Payment System” (FPS), fully connecting different banks and stored value payment tools (collectively referred to as “e-wallets”).\nPublished the banking industry Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework and promoted the industry’s implementation of Open APIs.\nEnhanced financial technology research and talent development.\nStrengthened cross-border financial technology cooperation.\nRevised the “Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks” and processed virtual bank license applications.\nThe upgraded version of the “Fintech Supervisory Sandbox” (FSS 2.0) is operating smoothly.\nAnd expanded “BankEasy” to promote the adoption of RegTech by banks.\n\nThe Financial Technology Promotion Office (FFO) under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with various banking departments within the HKMA, plays a crucial role in promoting and implementing the aforementioned measures.\n\nWith the implementation of optimized measures for the mutual market access schemes between Mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong’s unique position as a primary gateway to the Mainland market has been further strengthened. The full implementation of the “Bond Connect” scheme with simultaneous delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement, and the State Council’s announcement of tax exemption arrangements for overseas investors investing in the Mainland’s bond market, have further enhanced the scheme’s efficiency and attractiveness. The HKMA has also been working closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a number of financial supporting measures to facilitate individuals and businesses living, working, and doing business in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area). Hong Kong’s offshore RMB business continues to thrive, with the pool of RMB deposits increasing by 6% year-on-year to RMB 657.7 billion; the average daily transaction volume of the RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system reached a high of RMB 1,010.1 billion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively exploring new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the Hong Kong bond market, the HKMA has implemented the “Bond Subsidy Pilot Programme” outlined in the Financial Budget, providing subsidies to institutions issuing bonds in Hong Kong for the first time. It is also working closely with the Government to amend legislation to broaden the scope of bond investment income eligible for tax exemption under the “Corporate Debt Issuance Programme.” Furthermore, the HKMA is strengthening its marketing efforts to promote Hong Kong’s advantages to stakeholders both overseas and in Mainland China, including organizing a number of large-scale and specialized outreach events to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure financing, and corporate treasury centres.\n\nAt the international level, the HKMA leads a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA currently chairs the Global Regulatory Cooperation Working Group under the Financial Stability Board, the Supervisory and Implementation Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Financial Market Work Group under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP).\n\nThe safe and effective operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for its status as an international financial center. The four Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Money Markets Unit (CMU) system, and the Hong Kong Securities Clearing and Settlement System (Hong Kong Securities Depository) all achieved 100% system availability in 2018, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. Through accounts maintained with two central securities depositories on the Mainland, the CMU system continues to facilitate the settlement of northbound trading under the Bond Connect scheme, as well as holding Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU system members.\n\nTo promote the overall safety and efficiency of the retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) designated two additional retail payment systems in August under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”), bringing their operation under the HKMA’s supervision. To date, the number of designated retail payment systems supervised by the HKMA has increased to six. The HKMA also regulates 16 licensed stored value facility operators, who are actively launching new products and services to provide customers with more choices and a better user experience. Simultaneously, the coverage of electronic cheques and electronic bill payment and presentment services has been further expanded to include cross-border payment transactions between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n## 2018 Retrospective\n\n# Hong Kong as an Asian Fintech Hub\n\n# Measures to Promote Smart Banking\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced seven initiatives to promote smart banking in September 2017, with the aim of helping the banking sector reach a higher level and seize the vast opportunities presented by the convergence of banking and technology. The HKMA has made good progress within the year in implementing these measures and transforming the financial landscape of Hong Kong.\n\n# Quick-witted.\n\n\"Faster Payments System\" successfully launched in September, enabling bank and stored value payment tool users to conduct real-time fund transfers in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi across banks anytime, anywhere, simply by entering the recipient’s mobile phone number or email address. A total of 21 banks (including most retail banks) and 10 stored value payment tool operators have joined the system, providing customers with instant payment services and\/or account linking services.\n\n“QuickPass” has already received over 2 million registrations within 3.5 months, representing 27% of Hong Kong’s population. Since its launch, the system has processed over 4.8 million transactions, involving a total value exceeding HK$104.9 billion and RMB 2.75 billion.\n\nIn the same month, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Hong Kong Retail Payment Shared QR Code Standard and its related mobile application, “Hong Kong QR” (HKQR). This is the world’s first mobile application to integrate multiple QR codes into a single, unified QR code, facilitating merchants – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – to accept payment solutions from different payment service providers using a single QR code, eliminating the need to display multiple QR codes to customers.\n\n# Open Application Interface\n\nOpen APIs refer to banks opening up their relevant data to third-party service providers, allowing for better and more convenient integration of banking services with other industries. Users can enjoy comprehensive services within a secure environment using a single system. To promote the development and provision of open APIs within the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued the Open API Framework in July. The framework adopts a risk-based approach and implements various open API functions in four phases. As of January 31, 2019, 20 banks had opened approximately 500 open API interfaces in the first phase, covering data for over 1,000 products and services.\n\n# Research and Talent Development\n\nA consortium of banks in Hong Kong launched “TradeConnect,” a trade finance platform based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), in October, building on the proof-of-concept results led by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The platform aims to reduce errors and fraud risks by digitizing trade documents and automating trade finance processes. As of the end of 2018, 12 banks had joined the consortium. In October, TradeConnect signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European trade finance platform “we.trade” to conduct a proof-of-concept integration between the two platforms. The HKMA is also simultaneously exploring opportunities to connect TradeConnect with other regions, including collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the “Global Trade Connectivity Network.”\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue (left) at the launch ceremony of \"Trade Connect.\"\n\nTo cultivate more fintech talent, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) upgraded its “Fintech Capability Assessment and Sponsorship” (FCAS) programme in January, collaborating with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to launch FCAS 2.0. FCAS 2.0 comprises four projects catering to young talent at different stages of their careers. Over 200 students have benefited from the programme.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue (second from left) attended the FCAS 2.0 launch ceremony with Hong Kong Digital Port Chairman Charles Lim (first from left), Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Chairman Wong Ming-sham (second from right), and Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation CEO Albert Wong (first from right).\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nFollowing the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal Government Financial Services Office (Shenzhen Financial Office) in 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has continued to strengthen its financial technology cooperation with Shenzhen. This includes the HKMA sponsoring the “Shenzhen Fintech Summer Internship Program,” enabling 50 students to undertake six-week internships at various prominent companies in Shenzhen and experience the local fintech ecosystem. Additionally, the HKMA co-organized the “Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Innovation Awards” with the Shenzhen Financial Office for a second time.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Deputy Chief Executive Li Tak-ji (second from right) speaks with the first group of Shenzhen FinTech summer interns.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority also signed FinTech cooperation agreements in 2018 with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, and the Central Bank of Brazil, to promote cooperation in financial technology.\n\nIn August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, along with 11 other financial regulatory authorities and related institutions, announced the “Global Financial Innovation Network” initiative. The network aims to provide innovative firms with a more effective way to engage with regulators and to foster collaboration among regulators on innovation-related issues.\n\n# Virtual Bank\n\nThe introduction of virtual banks will inject new impetus into Hong Kong’s financial technology applications and bring a novel experience to digital banking customers. As virtual banks target retail customers such as individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, they will also help promote financial inclusion. Following a public consultation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued the revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks in May and received approximately 30 applications by the end of August.\n\n# Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox\n\nSandbox usage has been steadily increasing throughout the year. To assist in building a financial compliance technology ecosystem, the sandbox was opened to FinTech projects starting in September.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, a total of 42 financial technology or technology products had been approved to use the regulatory sandbox for testing, of which 28 had completed the trial phase and subsequently launched into the market. The HKMA also received 220 cases seeking feedback from regulators in the early stages of conceiving fintech projects through the “Fintech Regulatory Chatroom.” Approximately 70% of these cases originated from technology companies.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2018年對投資者而言是困難的一年，投資環境備受多項風險因素困擾，包括美國利率持續正常化引發金融狀況收緊、主要經濟體之間的貿易摩擦升級，以及全球多處民粹主義抬頭及地緣政治風險加劇。環球股市普遍向下，美國國庫券收益率亦隨着美國聯邦儲備局4次加息而上升。在美息趨升下，美元轉強。部分新興市場面對國內嚴峻的政治及經濟壓力，其貨幣顯著下挫。儘管投資環境充滿挑戰，外匯基金在2018年仍錄得109億港元投資收入。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產配置中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一及未來基金與外匯基金附屬公司存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎部分的總和。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但主要以未來基金除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2018年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重約為50:50。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置，即投資基準反映的配置情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，對資產進行戰略性配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於8月成立外匯基金投資辦公室，專責投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約72%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分的投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約28%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，以取得可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專業投資技術知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，突顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況。金管局已加強風險評估，以配合外匯基金越趨多元化的投資；另採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，以識別促成不同表現的成因，藉此評估如何充分利用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資。例如，金管局已採納證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《負責任的擁有權原則》。該套原則旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局已就環境、社會及管治因素制定內部指引，適用於外聘基金經理的甄選、委任及監察程序。獲委任負責主動式管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理，須在管理有關投資時遵守《負責任的擁有權原則》。整體而言，金管局已將環境、社會及管治因素納入投資及相關監察活動的內部程序。金管局會密切注視環境、社會及管治因素的相關標準的發展，並評估如何能夠將這些標準進一步融入投資程序。此外，為促進負責任投資的國際合作，金管局已成為非牟利組織FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織旨在推動長遠目標為本的業務及投資決定。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2018年的金融市場\n\n在2018年，原先被市場低估的多項風險因素一一浮現，包括美國利率正常化的步伐、美國政府外貿政策和保護主義對全球貿易的衝擊，以及地緣政治的風險，環球金融市場因而出現大幅波動及調整。\n\n中美貿易爭議升級，令投資者非常憂慮，新興市場及香港股市自1月底開始反覆下跌，恒生指數自該月份的高位最多下跌27%。自第4季起，主要歐美股市亦大幅下滑，錄得雙位數字跌幅。就2018年整體而言，全球股市普遍下跌，涵蓋已發展國家股市的MSCI全球指數下跌10.4%，MSCI新興市場指數亦下跌16.6%。\n\n債市方面，由於美國貨幣政策正常化，美國國庫券收益率於2018年大致向上。然而，年內債市仍有波動。例如10年期美國國庫券收益率由年初約2.5%上升至11月3.2%的7年新高，但至年底時受投資者憂慮中美貿易爭議及趨向避險投資所影響而回軟至2.7%。\n\n貨幣市場方面，年內美元跟隨美國加息轉強。美匯指數上升4.4%，歐元及人民幣等主要貨幣兌美元下跌約5%。此外，部分新興市場受到國內政局及經濟不穩影響，其貨幣進一步受挫。例如，阿根廷披索及土耳其里拉兌美元分別下跌約五成及三成。相比之下，避險投資需求帶動日圓兌美元上升2.7%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2018年的表現。\n\n表1 2018年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2018年錄得109億港元投資收入，當中包括債券投資收益574億港元、香港股票投資虧損207億港元、其他股票投資虧損387億港元、非港元資產外匯估值下調90億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益219億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得5億港元估值下調。\n\n於2018年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,549億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為2,836億港元，當中私募股權為1,911億港元，房地產為925億港元。已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,024億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2018年的投資回報率為0.3%，其中投資組合的回報率為負2.4%，支持組合為2.1%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.9%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2018年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2018年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為3.2%、過去5年為2.1%、過去10年為2.8%，以及自1994年起計為4.7%3。表3列載外匯基金資產於2018年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2018 was a challenging year for investors, with the investment landscape beset by a number of risk factors, including tightening financial conditions triggered by continued US interest rate normalization, escalating trade friction between major economies, and the rise of populism and heightened geopolitical risks in various parts of the world. Global stock markets generally declined, and US Treasury yields rose as the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates four times. The strengthening of the US dollar followed the rise in US interest rates. Several emerging markets, facing significant domestic political and economic pressures, experienced substantial currency depreciations. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$10.9 billion in 2018.\n\n# Exchange Stabilization Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Ordinance, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, directly or indirectly. It may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the operation and investment management of the Exchange Fund, in accordance with the powers delegated to it and the provisions for further delegation by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee has established the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) Preserve capital;\n(b) ensure that the monetary base is at all times fully backed by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) seek to maximize investment returns, consistent with the foregoing (a) to (c), to preserve the fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively address the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in the Fund’s portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: the Support Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Support Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar assets, providing full backing for the monetary base in accordance with the provisions of the monetary authority system. The Investment Portfolio primarily invests in the debt and equity markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the aim of preserving asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is diversifying a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a wider range of asset classes in a prudent and gradual manner, including emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging markets and Mainland bonds and equities are held by the investment portfolio, while private equity and real estate investments are held by the Long-Term Growth Portfolio. The market value of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio is capped at one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surplus and the total of the portion of deposits of the Future Fund and the Exchange Fund’s subsidiaries that is linked to the Long-Term Growth Portfolio.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited purchased by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to the unique nature of this portfolio, its performance is not included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund’s investment performance.\n\n# Regarding deposits in the Exchange Fund.\n\nThe Exchange Fund accepts deposits from fiscal reserves, government funds, and statutory organizations from time to time, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for the Future Fund. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the weighting of the portfolios. At the end of 2018, the weighting of the Future Fund between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 50:50.\n\n# Investment Process\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation refers to the asset mix reflected in the investment benchmark, indicating the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. The Exchange Fund uses strategic allocation as a guideline to make tactical allocations, aiming to generate returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (which is the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is known as “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is authorized to determine the tactical asset allocation and define the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can then select holdings within the permissible range of tactical deviation to profit from short-term market fluctuations.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Exchange Fund Investment Office in August, dedicated to investment and related risk management functions. Staff of the office are directly responsible for managing approximately 72% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion of the portfolio invests in global fixed income markets and implements the Exchange Fund’s macro risk management strategies through the use of derivatives.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also employs external investment managers responsible for managing approximately 28% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all listed equity portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of employing external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market for Exchange Fund investments, to achieve sustainable returns, and to allow the Exchange Fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as to gain market insights and professional investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to hiring external investment managers include fund management and custody fees, transaction costs, withholding taxes, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily subject to market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Oversight\n\nThe investment environment is becoming increasingly complex, highlighting the importance of risk management. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established stringent control measures and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed investment portfolios, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. The Authority has enhanced risk assessments to align with the increasing diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investments, and also employs risk management tools to assess market risk under both normal and severely adverse market conditions. The Authority also conducts detailed investment performance attribution analysis to identify the drivers of different performance outcomes, thereby evaluating how to best leverage the investment management expertise of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible Investment\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports responsible investment. For example, the HKMA has adopted the Principles of Responsible Ownership published by the Securities and Futures Commission. These principles aim to help investors determine the best way to fulfill their ownership responsibilities in Hong Kong-listed companies. Regarding the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has established internal guidelines on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, applicable to the selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. External fund managers appointed to actively manage the Hong Kong equity portfolio are required to comply with the Principles of Responsible Ownership when managing these investments. Overall, the HKMA has integrated ESG factors into its internal procedures for investment and related monitoring activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of relevant ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further incorporated into its investment processes. Furthermore, to promote international cooperation in responsible investment, the HKMA has become a member of the non-profit organization FCLTGlobal, which aims to promote business and investment decisions with a long-term orientation.\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\n## The 2018 Financial Market\n\nIn 2018, a number of risk factors that had previously been underestimated by the market all came to the surface, including the pace of U.S. interest rate normalization, the impact of U.S. government foreign trade policies and protectionism on global trade, and geopolitical risks. This resulted in significant volatility and adjustments in global financial markets.\n\nThe escalating US-China trade dispute has caused significant concern among investors, leading to fluctuating declines in emerging markets and the Hong Kong stock market since the end of January, with the Hang Seng Index falling as much as 27% from its high that month. Major stock markets in Europe and the US have also experienced substantial declines since the fourth quarter, recording double-digit percentage drops. Overall, global stock markets generally fell in 2018, with the MSCI World Index, covering developed market equities, down 10.4%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index down 16.6%.\n\nIn the bond market, due to the normalization of US monetary policy, US Treasury yields generally rose throughout 2018. However, the bond market still experienced fluctuations during the year. For example, the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes rose from approximately 2.5% at the beginning of the year to a seven-year high of 3.2% in November, but softened to 2.7% by year-end as investors grew concerned about the US-China trade dispute and shifted towards risk-averse investments.\n\nIn the currency market, the US dollar strengthened this year following interest rate hikes in the United States. The US Dollar Index rose 4.4%, while major currencies such as the Euro and the Renminbi depreciated approximately 5% against the dollar. Furthermore, the currencies of some emerging markets suffered further setbacks due to domestic political and economic instability. For example, the Argentine Peso and the Turkish Lira fell by approximately 50% and 30% against the dollar, respectively. In contrast, demand for safe-haven investments drove the Japanese Yen up 2.7% against the dollar.\n\nTable 1 shows the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2018.\n\nTable 1: 2018 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$10.9 billion in 2018, comprising gains of HK$57.4 billion from debt instrument investments, losses of HK$20.7 billion from Hong Kong equity investments, losses of HK$38.7 billion from other equity investments, a valuation decrease of HK$9 billion for non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and other investment income of HK$21.9 billion held by the Exchange Fund Investment Office’s subsidiaries. Meanwhile, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation decrease of HK$0.5 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the total value of the Exchange Fund’s assets reached HK$405.49 billion. The total market value of the long-term growth portfolio investments was HK$283.6 billion, of which HK$191.1 billion was in private equity and HK$92.5 billion was in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn for investment was HK$202.4 billion.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund’s (excluding strategic asset allocation) investment return rate in 2018 was 0.3%, with the portfolio return at -2.4% and support investments at 2.1%. The long-term growth portfolio has achieved an annualized internal rate of return of 12.9% since the commencement of investment in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rates of return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2018. Table 2 presents the Exchange Fund’s investment rate of return in 2018 and the average investment rate of return over different periods.

Cash compensation comprises a fixed monthly salary (i.e., basic salary) and a variable pay component awarded annually based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) staff remuneration annually, consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee to obtain advice from its governance committee.

The remuneration of individual employees with outstanding performance may also be subject to special adjustments to maintain its competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed and variable compensation based on individual employee performance. The variable compensation scheme applicable to employees responsible for investment is designed to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration. Adjustments to the fixed compensation and disbursement of variable compensation for Assistant General Manager and above are approved by the Financial Secretary after considering the views of the Governance Committee, and relevant employees recuse themselves from discussions on their own compensation proposals at meetings. Adjustments to the fixed compensation and disbursement of variable compensation for staff at the Manager level and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA, under the authorization of the Financial Secretary, and in accordance with the total funds approved for salary payments.\n\n## Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 lists the compensation information for senior personnel in 2018.\n\n1.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第167至273頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2018年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2018年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及40.1。\n\n於2018年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共36,935.89億港元，金融負債共11,338.29億港元。\n\n93%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘7%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共2,756.31億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融 資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、20及21。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2018年12月31日共值253.21億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及20間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值443.36億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2018年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n朱乃璋\n\n2019 年 4 月 4 日\n","en":"# Exchange Stabilization Fund\n\n- Report of the Auditor-General\n- Financial Statements of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Auditor-General\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nWe hereby certify that we have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 167 to 273, which financial statements include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as at 31 December 2018, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nI consider that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group at December 31, 2018 and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive in Council under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66).\n\n# Basis of opinion.\n\nI have performed the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities under those standards are set out in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements’ section of this report. As part of an audit in accordance with those standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I am independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements in Hong Kong, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those requirements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are of most significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. I addressed these matters in the course of my audit of, and in forming my opinion on, the financial statements as a whole, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair Value\n\nPlease refer to the notes to the financial statements 2.5, 2.6 and 40.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Group’s financial assets measured at fair value totaled HK$36,935.89 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HK$11,338.29 billion.\n\n93% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are valued at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs), or are valued using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 7% of these financial assets is determined using valuation techniques, with parameters not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets totaled HK$275.631 billion and primarily include unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the reliance on estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures regarding the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value include:\n\n- Understand the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluate and test monitoring measures, including related application monitoring measures for computer systems;\n- Obtain confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- If market quotations are used, verify prices from independent sources;\n- If the parameters of the valuation methods used are based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate and whether the related assumptions are reasonable, and verify the parameters from independent sources; and\n- If the parameters of the valuation methods used are not based on observable market data, evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate, and whether the related assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Valuation of investment property measured at fair value.\n\nPlease refer to notes 2.12, 20, and 21 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties are carried at fair value, totaling HK$25.321 billion as of December 31, 2018. The Group also has interests in 3 associate companies and 20 joint ventures, whose primary business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with a combined value of HK$44.336 billion. The fair value of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group or by associate or joint venture companies, is primarily determined based on valuations from independent professional valuers. These valuations involve significant judgment and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures regarding the valuation of investment properties measured at fair value include:\n\n- Obtain and review valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verify that the fair value is determined based on the valuation as stated in the relevant valuation reports;\n- Assess the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- Evaluate whether the valuation methods are appropriate and whether the relevant assumptions and parameters are reasonable.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe Financial Controller is responsible for all other information. This other information includes all information contained in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2018 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to any other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on that other information.\n\nWith regard to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other information to consider whether that information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Based on my work, if I believe that other information contains a material misstatement, I am required to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Financial Controller and the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Division and the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with Respect to Financial Statements.\n\nFinancial management officers are responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for implementing internal controls as they deem necessary to ensure that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial management officers are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and for disclosing matters related to going concern where applicable, using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards will detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIn the course of conducting audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the Audit Commission, I will exercise professional judgment and maintain a professional skeptical attitude. I will also:\n\n- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud or error; designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks; and obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for my opinion. Fraud is more difficult to detect than error because it often involves collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- Understanding internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures appropriate in the circumstances. However, this is not an expression of an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies adopted by the management, and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by them;\n- Assessing whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the management is appropriate, and evaluating, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists relating to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention to related disclosures in the financial statements in my auditor’s report, or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events; and\n- Obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising and performing the Group audit. I am solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Council regarding the audit scope and timeline of the plan, as well as any significant audit findings, including any material weaknesses in internal controls that I identify during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have complied with the relevant ethical requirements concerning independence, and communicate to them any relationships and other matters that could reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, as well as any related safeguards put in place where appropriate.\n\nBased on my communication with the Audit Committee under the purview of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine which matters are most important to the audit of the financial statements for this period and therefore constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in my auditor’s report, unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or, in extremely rare circumstances, when I determine that the negative consequences of communicating a matter in my report would outweigh the public benefit derived from doing so.\n\nAuditor-General\nChu Nai-chang\n\nApril 4, 2019\n"}
