{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong.\n","zh":"# 行政長官聲明\n\n2017年，全球经济和金融市场表现遠超預期：實體經濟持續增長；通脹保持溫和；美國聯邦儲備委員會當年進行的三次加息及縮減資產負債表的措施，並未導致新興市場經濟體出現資金外流或美元走強。在樂觀情緒推動下，全球股市，包括三大美國股市指數，不斷創下新高。MSCI新興市場指數上漲34%。恆生指數在2017年累計上升近8,000點（或36%），並於2018年1月突破30,000點大關，創歷史新高。\n\n在如此有利的環境中，許多投資者充滿了樂觀情緒，甚至過度樂觀。然而，這種情況持續到今年二月初，當時最新數據顯示美國工資上漲幅度高於預期，促使投資者重新評估通脹風險，並引發全球股市的重大修正。道瓊斯指數在二月第二週兩天內下跌超過1,000點，恆生指數在同一週內下跌超過3,000點。美國10年期國債收益率急升至高達2.95%。資金流動的迅速反轉表明，創紀錄的高市場估值並非建立在穩固的基礎之上。這也提醒我們，香港需要健全而穩固的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動和資金外流帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 預防措施提升銀行體系韌性\n\n俗話說：「預防勝於治療」。香港金融管理局於2017年實施進一步的風險緩衝措施，以保障香港銀行及金融系統的穩定。五月份，我們推出了銀行按揭貸款的第八輪逆週期措施，並加強銀行對房地產發展商貸款的信貸風險管理，旨在提高銀行系統對樓市下行所帶來衝擊的應對能力。經過多輪措施，至2017年底，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與樓價比率由2009年9月的64%降至49%，而平均償債比率亦由2010年8月的41%降至35%。\n\n2017年，我們成立了解決辦公室，以落實針對被視為「大到不能倒」的不可持續金融機構的國際解決標準。這將有助於防止類似2008年全球金融危機的重演，當時公眾資金被用來拯救陷入困境的金融機構，同時也能最大限度地減少這些機構關閉對金融體系、經濟和廣大社區的影響。\n\n健全的風險管理是銀行業穩健和可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動性比率和資本充足率遠高於適用的法定要求，並位居全球最高水平之一。這無疑反映了香港銀行體系的高度韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年實現了強勁增長，總貸款額增加16%，資產質量也保持良好。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年的0.72%降至2017年的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水準2.2%。銀行業整體股東權益回報率（以稅前營運利潤計算）在2017年達到11.74%，與其他國際金融中心相比，是一個非常健康的水平。\n\n# 健全的銀行體制是長期財務穩定的關鍵\n\n2008年全球金融危機揭示了單純依賴規則和法規來約束金融業追求利潤而不顧其首要責任的局限性。鑒於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）近年來加強推動「穩健銀行」實踐，鼓勵銀行發展和追求良好的企業文化和價值觀。特別是為應對銀行員工追求短期利潤而損害客戶或銀行長期利益的問題，我們正鼓勵銀行建立與其企業文化和價值觀相符的適當激勵制度。作為這項運動的一部分，我們於2017年3月舉辦了首屆獨立非執行董事（INEDs）年度大會，以強調建立良好銀行文化的重要性，並賦予INEDs更有效地履行監督和監測職責的權力。\n\n在銀行業的支援下，2017年對於香港金融管理局（HKMA）推動金融包容的進展來說是成功的一年。六間實體銀行分行及三間流動分行開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與EPS及一間便利店連鎖店達成協議，推出試驗計劃，讓長者可在偏遠地區的便利店提現，無需進行購物。香港郵政亦於今年在七間郵局推出長者現金提領服務，這些郵局主要設於離島及新界地區。關於開戶方面，香港金融管理局去年設立了專門網頁及電郵帳號，並由專責團隊跟進公眾關於開設銀行帳戶的查詢或投訴。由於各持份者的共同努力，個人及企業銀行帳戶開設的客戶體驗已顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技成為銀行業的遊戲改變者\n\n在科技快速发展的时代，金融科技已逐步融入我们的日常生活。在這個不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須擁抱新發展，積極推動金融科技的應用創新。隨著智慧銀行新時代的來臨，香港金融管理局於九月推出了七項倡議（詳見第106頁），以促進銀行業採用金融科技，提升客戶銀行產品與服務的品質。雖然這些倡議彼此獨立，但卻相輔相成，將會是香港支付與銀行服務未來發展格局的關鍵轉變。客戶不僅將享有更便捷、高效且安全的支付與銀行服務，同時也會擁有更多選擇與更大的財務交易控制權。金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁入智慧銀行新時代將為銀行帶來升級與轉型的絕佳契機。\n\n# “一帶一路”與粵港澳大灣區倡議帶來的巨大機遇\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭日益激烈，多元化的金融產業對香港至關重要。2017年，香港金融管理局加強了提升香港作為國際金融中心競爭力的工作。鑒於香港獨有的優勢，即「背靠祖國、面向世界」，「一帶一路」倡議和粵港澳大灣區的發展將為金融銀行業帶來巨大機遇，並為香港經濟增長注入新動力。為響應「一帶一路」倡議而設立的香港金融管理局基礎設施融資促進辦公室，自啟動以來合作夥伴已增至約90個，為推動香港成為基礎設施投資融資中心奠定了堅實基礎。2017年中國開發銀行在香港發行首隻「一帶一路」債券，凸顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面所發揮的重要作用。\n\n除了基礎設施融資之外，我們亦積極參與推動香港成為企業財務中心、私募基金及亞洲衍生產品業務的樞紐，藉此吸引跨國企業及主要金融機構在本市管理其資金、資產及各種財務風險。這些措施將進一步鞏固並提升香港的金融及相關專業服務業。香港金融管理局亦與負責粵港澳大灣區發展的有關當局保持密切對話，加強合作，以協助大灣區發展成為世界級城市群的金融中心。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業一直以「發揮香港優勢，服務國家需要」為主題不斷發展。自2014年推出滬港通、2016年推出深港通，以及去年七月推出債券通北向交易後，通過香港金融平台，內地與世界其他地區的互聯互通範圍已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這凸顯了香港作為金融中介的獨特角色，協助全球投資者進入內地金融市場。2017年，香港繼續保持全球最大離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。人民幣實時全額清算系統的日均交易額達人民幣900億元。此外，根據SWIFT的數據，當年全球逾70%的人民幣支付交易均通過香港進行。離岸人民幣市場持續順利運作，穩定發展。\n\n# 培育人才以強化銀行業的軟實力\n\n隨著金融業的持續發展，培育人才對其實現可持續發展至關重要。香港金融管理局（HKMA）十分重視銀行業的軟實力，一直積極推動和支援銀行界人士的持續能力建設。在《提升專業能力架構》引入反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資及網絡安全兩個模組後，我們於去年進一步擴展其涵蓋範圍，加入零售財富管理及財務管理，以通過持續專業發展提升銀行界人士的核心能力水平。香港金融管理局亦致力培育銀行業的年輕人才。2017年，我們與業界合作推出了私人財富管理學徒試驗計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。鑑於反應熱烈，這些計劃將在未來進一步擴展其涵蓋範圍。\n\n# 謹慎的投資策略，於中長期內實現合理穩定的回報\n\n在強勁的全球經濟增長推動下，儲備基金去年實現了跨資產類別的全面收益，包括股票、債券及外匯，投資收入創下2,640億港元的歷史新高。整體投資回報率為7.4%。投資組合的回報率達12.1%，而擔保組合則為1.8%。自2009年成立以來，長期增長組合（LTGP）的年化內部回報率高達13.7%。儘管去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境要求香港金融管理局持續謹慎管理儲備基金。我們將保持靈活應變，密切監察市場動態，並在適當時候採取防禦措施。長期增長組合的投資規模亦將進一步擴大。一如往常，在管理香港市民的財富時，我們將始終遵循「首重資本保值，其次追求長期增長」的投資原則，並在可接受的風險水平內進行操作。\n\n儘管全球實體經濟延續了去年的增長動能，但2018年不確定性與風險依然眾多。其中包括若通脹上揚，美國加息步伐可能比預期更快；貿易摩擦升級；以及地緣政治形勢惡化等。倘若這些下行風險成真，將對全球金融市場產生重大而廣泛的影響，進而對香港的資金流動、資產價格和實體經濟產生連鎖反應。因此，我們都應謹慎應對風險。\n\n在未來幾個月內，香港美元利率的走勢很可能仍將受到關注。自2015年12月以來，美國聯邦儲備系統已加息六次。隨著香港美元利率與美元利率之間的利差擴大，資金從香港美元流向美元的動機也隨之增加。近期香港美元面臨走弱壓力，並觸發了7.85弱方貨幣發行擔保（CU）。正如我們多次指出，當觸發7.85弱方CU時，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將以「超級兌換商」的角色，在市場上買入香港美元、賣出美元，以確保香港美元匯率不會跌破7.85水平。這種操作是正常的，也符合聯繫匯率制度的設計，不應引起任何擔憂。事實上，目前香港外匯基金持有的資產總額超過4萬億港元，其中香港美元貨幣基礎約為1.7萬億港元，為資金外流提供了強大的緩衝。多年來，香港金融管理局已建立多層防線，以維護銀行及金融系統的穩定。從正面角度看，資金外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，這有助於香港利率環境的正常化，進而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在這個過程中，香港金融管理局將保持警惕，努力維護香港的貨幣和銀行體系穩定。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt securities\n","zh":"# 經濟與財政環境\n\n在2017年全球經濟擴張更加同步的背景下，香港經濟增長較快，勞動市場情況趨緊，通脹壓力則較為緩和。預計2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在全球經濟擴張更加協調的背景下，香港經濟在2017年實現了更快的增長。實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長率上升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長率，以及過去十年約3%的長期增長率（圖1和表1）。內需有所強化，私人消費增長加快，整體投資支出復甦。強勁的內需反映了就業和收入狀況良好、資產價格上漲以及企業經營氣氛改善。從外部來看，由於全球貿易流量增加，香港貨物出口增速加快；由於貿易和貨運流量活躍以及入境旅遊業改善，服務出口也有所恢復。受出口引致的需求推動，貨物進口錄得較強增長，而居民旅遊興趣強勁，服務進口也持續增加。從淨出口來看，整體貿易順差收窄，對GDP增長產生了負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n在貨幣方面，港元對美元的匯率一般因港元與美元之間的負利率差而受到利率套利活動的推動而有所緩和。這反映了聯繫匯率制度按照其設計正常運作。雖然水平仍然相對偏低，但由於首次公開招股相關的融資需求以及銀行年底的流動性需求，2017年底港元銀行間利率面臨更大的上行壓力。就信貸增長而言，在連續兩年個位數增長後，2017年總銀行貸款以顯著較快的16.1%速度增長，反映出經濟狀況改善及金融市場情緒樂觀。儘管貸款增長加快，但銀行的信貸審批標準並未出現放鬆跡象，整體貸款品質仍然良好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2017年全年通脹壓力均保持在受控範圍內（圖表2）。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，核心通脹率下降至1.7%，較2016年的2.3%為低。特別是物價指數中的房屋部分增幅趨緩，反映出2016年新租私人住宅租金增幅放緩的影響逐漸顯現。更廣泛而言，在強勁的生產增長背景下，名義工資和收入增幅較為溫和，有助於控制本地成本壓力。進口物價通脹亦處於低水平，儘管美元走弱，但香港主要進口來源地的通脹率亦偏低，因此進口物價通脹表現溫和。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2017年，隨著經濟增長超過預期，勞動市場趨於緊縮。經過季節調整後的失業率從2016年的3.4%降至2017年底的2.9%，這是近20年來首次跌破3%（見圖表3）。大多數主要經濟部門的失業率都有所下降，其中零售、金融以及專業和商業服務部門的降幅尤其明顯。隨著總體就業人數增長加快，以及私人部門的職位空缺增加，整體勞動需求持續增強。勞動力也有所擴張，部分原因在於年齡較大的勞動者（55歲及以上）參與度提高。與更緊縮的勞動市場狀況和較低的通貨膨脹相一致，實際工資和收入出現了更快的增長。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2017年香港股市幾乎沒有間斷地上漲。恒生指數上漲36%，為自2010年以來最大的年度漲幅（圖4）。這輪上漲反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利樂觀的預期，部分原因在於內地投資者透過滬港通和深港通帶來大量資金流入。恒生指數在11月創下十年來新高，並在2017年底維持在高水平。日均成交額從前一年的669億港元擴大至883億港元，而本地市場籌集的總股本資金也從一年前的4901億港元增加至5814億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年持續上揚（圖表4）。交易量由去年同期的54,701個單位增至61,591個單位，而樓價在2017年上升了14.8%。樓價與收入的比例達到16.4，高於1997年的歷史峰值，而收入負擔比率則為74.1，遠高於其長期平均水準。鑒於樓價上漲及銀行之間房貸業務競爭加劇，香港金融管理局於5月推出了第八輪審慎措施，以加強銀行的風險管理並維護銀行體系穩定。在這些措施實施後，樓價增長一度放緩，但於第四季再度加速。至於工商物業市場，全年交易活動顯著增加，交易額及交易量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格回升，相應的租金回報率較去年同期略有下降。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計2018年的經濟增長將保持穩健。政府預測增長率將介於3%至4%之間，而私人機構分析師則預計經濟平均增長率為3.2%。從外部因素來看，香港的出口表現將繼續受益於全球增長前景的改善以及入境旅遊業的逐步復甦。從內部因素來看，私人消費增長預計將保持穩定，主要得益於有利的勞動市場環境。至於固定資本形成方面，建築活動應會因住房供應增加及基礎設施建設持續而穩步推進。儘管改善的經濟環境將支持企業資本支出，但利率可能上調將帶來一些阻力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n在仍然相對溫和的全球通貨膨脹及本地成本持續上升的情況下，預計香港2018年的通脹壓力將保持溫和，但通脹率可能從2017年的低點逐漸回升。例如，由於新租私人住宅租金的上漲傳導效應，通脹中的租金成分可能在2018年下半年加速上升。市場共識預測2018年的整體通脹率將保持在相對溫和的2.2%，而政府預計核心通脹率將為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、建築工程活動的擴展以及入境旅遊的逐步復甦，預計將在未來一段時間內使勞動市場保持緊張。私人機構分析師預測2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%的水平。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景面臨多項不確定性與風險，包括主要央行貨幣政策正常化、全球金融市場穩定性，以及保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張局勢惡化等因素。特別是，如果這些風險成真並引發資金流動的逆轉，香港的貨幣條件可能比預期更快收緊，對實體經濟和資產價格造成下行壓力。\n\n住宅房地产市場的前景仍然不確定。在短期內，目前有利的國內經濟環境、被認為的住房短缺、低房貸利率以及其他的房屋融資來源（包括房地產開發商提供的房貸和來自父母的財務支持），將會持續支持對房產的需求。然而，近期全球金融市場的拋售可能會影響市場情緒。從長遠來看，房地產市場將持續面臨多項阻力。特別是，隨著美國貨幣政策正常化持續進行，國內房貸利率最終將會上漲。此外，由於政府努力增加土地和住宅供應，住房供需缺口預計將逐漸縮小，這將在長遠來看緩解房價的上漲壓力。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n儘管全球經濟存在不確定性，香港銀行業在2017年繼續保持穩健。獲授權機構（AIs）的資本和流動性狀況依然強勁，資產質量維持在健康水平，盈利能力則因利差擴大和信貸增長強勁而顯著改善。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化持續進行，2017年香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBOR）的一個月期和三個月期分別上調49個基點和39個基點。第四季度則出現更顯著的上升。然而，以綜合利率衡量的零售銀行港元融資成本，整體上全年大致保持穩定（圖5）。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n零售銀行在香港辦事處的稅前營運利潤總額在2017年增長了15.8%。表現改善主要歸因於淨利息收入增加20.3%以及手續費和佣金收入增加9.4%。然而，這些增長部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入下降29.9%以及營運費用增加8.4%所抵消。由於2016年記錄了某些非經常性項目，零售銀行的稅後利潤總額下降了18.1%。零售銀行的平均資產稅後報酬率從2016年的1.44%下降至1.07%（圖6）。\n\n零售銀行的淨息差從2016年的1.32%擴大至2017年的1.45%（圖7），主要由於市場利率上漲所致。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營業收入的比例從2016年的44.3%下降至40%。雖然手續費和佣金收入增加了9.4%，但來自外匯和衍生工具業務的收入則下降了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行的營運成本與收入比率由2016年的43.2%降至2017年的41.9%，因營運成本（+8.4%）的增幅低於營運收入（+11.8%）的增幅（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減值虧損由2016年的80億港元減少至73億港元。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n零售銀行的貸款品質在本年度有所改善，分類貸款比率由去年同期的0.72%降至0.54%。逾期及重組貸款比率亦由2016年的0.53%降至0.4%（圖9）。同樣地，整個銀行業的分類貸款比率及逾期及重組貸款比率分別由0.85%和0.67%降至0.67%和0.52%。\n\n銀行的住宅抵押貸款組合品質持續良好，截至2017年底，違約率維持在低水平的0.03%（圖表10）。重新安排貸款的比例接近0%。與去年年底有四起負債超過房屋價值的住宅抵押貸款相比，今年年底則沒有這樣的貸款。\n\n2017年底信用卡貸款的違約率維持在0.22%的低水平，較去年同期的0.24%略低（圖表10）。在同期內，違約與重新安排貸款的綜合比率也小幅下降至0.31%，較之前的0.33%有所下降。核銷比率也從2016年的1.92%小幅降至1.75%。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業總貸款額在2017年增長了16.1%，較2016年的6.5%有所上升。信貸需求增加，是因為對全球經濟前景持樂觀態度。由於總存款的增長速度低於總貸款的增長速度，整體貸款對存款比率從2016年底的68.4%上升至2017年底的73%。港元貸款對存款比率亦由同期的77.1%上升至82.7%（圖表11）。\n\n與內地相關的貸款（包括在內地設立的本地銀行子公司所記賬的貸款）在2017年增長了17.5%，較2016年7%的增長率有所上升。\n\n# 可流通債務證券持有情況\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial stability.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管港元匯率所受壓力有所減弱，港元匯兌市場及貨幣市場仍繼續有序運作，流動性充足。聯繫匯率制度一直作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的堅實支柱，並證明其對各種衝擊具有高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定是指香港貨幣在國際外匯市場上對美元的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的波動範圍內。香港的貨幣體系結構以貨幣局制度為特徵，要求貨幣基礎必須至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備資產作為後盾，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須由相應的美元儲備資產變動來完全配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括以下內容：\n- 債務證書，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全部擔保\n- 政府發行並流通行中的紙幣和硬幣\n- 總餘額，即銀行在港元銀行（HKMA）開設的清算賬戶餘額總和\n- 由港元銀行代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund Bills and Notes（EFBNs）\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行貨幣發鈔承擔（Convertibility Undertakings，簡稱CUs）的承諾來維持的。當對香港美元的需求高於供應，市場匯率強升至強方貨幣發鈔承擔水平，即每美元兌換7.75港元時，香港金融管理局準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總餘額隨之擴展，壓低港元利率，創造貨幣條件，使港元匯率從強方限制水平移動至7.75至7.85的貨幣發鈔區間內。相反地，若香港美元的供應高於需求，市場匯率弱跌至弱方貨幣發鈔承擔水平，即每美元兌換7.85港元時，香港金融管理局將從銀行購入港元。總餘額隨之收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元匯率從弱方限制水平移動，並保持在7.75至7.85的貨幣發鈔區間內。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 汇率穩定性\n\n2017年港元匯率普遍受到貶值壓力（圖表1）。主要由於港元與美元利率之間的負利差擴大，促使套利交易活動增加，港元對美元逐漸走弱，從1月3日的7.7566跌至8月22日的年內低點7.8265。從9月下旬至11月初，港元匯率有所回升，這主要是由於首次公開招股（IPO）相關資金需求導致港元流動性收緊所支撐，匯率在7.80至7.81的狹窄範圍內穩定交投。到了年底，港元再度出現貶值壓力，部分反映港元流動性條件略微改善，以及年底對美元的商業需求增加。總體而言，2017年港元匯率市場運作正常。\n\n由於貨幣單位（CUs）並未被觸發，2017年總體餘額與未償還的外匯銀行券（EFBNs）總額基本上維持不變，約為1,2253億港元（見圖表2）。在該年度內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）為應對銀行對流動性管理需求的增加，共發行了800億港元額外的外匯基金債券。這導致總體餘額在2017年底收窄至1798億港元。發行額外的外匯基金債券符合貨幣局原則，因為這只代表貨幣基礎組成的改變，即從總體餘額轉移到未償還的外匯銀行券。貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n2017年前八個月，港元銀行間利率保持鬆動，但年內後段則面臨更大上行壓力（圖3）。儘管市場對美國聯邦儲備委員會加息及資產負債表正常化存在擔憂，但港元銀行間利率在前八個月大致仍保持鬆動。因此，港元與美元利率之間的負利差在1月至8月間擴大。自9月起，短期港元銀行間利率因與首次公開募股（IPO）相關及年底資金需求而大幅上升。相應地，短期港元與美元利率之間的負利差收窄。整體而言，2017年短期銀行間利率大多交易於基本利率之下。\n\n基準利率分別於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日調高，總計上調75個基點，由1.00%調至1.75%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次上調共75個基點，由0.50–0.75%調至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整是根據2009年3月26日公佈的修訂公式進行的，該公式規定基準利率應為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限之上50個基點，或過夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBOR）五日移動平均值的平均數，以較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤香港美元利率差的走勢，香港美元遠期點數的折讓在頭三個季度逐漸擴大，至9月中旬，12個月期的香港美元遠期點數達到約-615個基點（見圖4）。第四季度，隨著港元與美元利率負差縮窄，港元遠期點數的折讓也略微收窄。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場持續有序運作，銀行間流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗借款額由2016年的53億港元增加至2017年的103億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直作為香港貨幣與金融穩定的重要基石，並在一系列區域性和全球性金融危機中證明了其高度的韌性。特區政府重申對聯繫匯率制度的全力支持，而外匯市場和貨幣市場的穩定性進一步強化了這一承諾的可信度。香港市民對港元作為支付手段和價值儲藏工具的信心亦持續強勁。在2017年與香港的第四條備忘錄磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申支持聯繫匯率制度，指出聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最合適的匯率安排。配合強健的金融監管與監管、謹慎的財政管理以及靈活的市場機制，聯繫匯率制度有效地幫助香港成功應對了內外各種挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港的最佳安排。」\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。2017年間，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對企業貸款、與物業相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管工作，以增強銀行體系的韌性。鑒於美國聯邦儲備系統持續正常化其貨幣政策，港元利率將會逐步回歸正常水平。香港金融管理局重申，根據LERS的設計，資金外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方貨幣單位（CU）及貨幣基礎縮減，都是港元利率正常化過程中的必要階段。香港金融管理局亦提醒公眾應謹慎管理風險，並為可能出現的金融波動做好準備。\n\n為提高貨幣基金會帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產用以支持貨幣基礎。所謂支持比率，即支持資產除以貨幣基礎，2017年期間該比率介乎106.7%至108.2%之間，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。截至2017年12月31日，該比率為108.1%（見圖表5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，在指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持組合的同時，所有外匯基金資產均可用以支持港元匯率。在面對突如其來的衝擊時，外匯基金龐大的財務資源將為維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強有力的後盾。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港金融管理局的外匯基金諮詢委員會貨幣局小組委員會（CBC）負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2017年，該小組委員會考慮了多項議題，包括香港樓價短期動態的驅動因素、港元銀行同业拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同业拆息（LIBOR）利差的決定因素、樓宇估值變動對中國內地企業貸款的影響，以及按揭債務服務負擔對香港私人消費的影響。貨幣局小組委員會就上述議題的討論紀錄，以及提交給該小組委員會的貨幣局運作報告，均會在香港金融管理局網站上發佈。\n\n香港金融研究機構（HKIMR）持續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域的研究。在過去三年間，HKIMR已重新調整其活動方向，使其更貼近政策相關性。這一點特別體現在其會議活動及訪問學者計劃中。HKIMR已與主要央行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦更多以政策為重點的會議。同時，自2016年推出的一個主題研究訪問學者計劃，亦支持更多與香港金融管理局（HKMA）關注的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了18位研究員，發表了29篇工作論文。該年間，HKIMR亦舉辦了四場國際研討會及會議，分別如下：\n- 「第八屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」於1月在香港舉行，主題為「中國經濟再平衡：未來將往何處？」該研討會為學者、政策制定者及商業經濟學家提供了一個論壇，以探討與中國內地經濟相關的重要分析與政策議題。會中發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，內容涵蓋中國內地經濟再平衡、結構改革與國際溢出效應、人民幣匯率議題，以及中國內地的貨幣政策架構與傳導機制等多樣議題。\n- 第15屆HKIMR暑期研討會於7月舉行。該研討會旨在為HKIMR與香港金融管理局（HKMA）的員工提供一個展示其研究論文的機會，並促進研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動交流。\n- 香港金融管理局與國際清算銀行（BIS）於8月聯合舉辦了主題為「匯率的價格與實質及金融影響」的研討會。該研討會提供了一個深入且具見地的討論平台，涵蓋了廣泛的重要議題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易定價系統、外匯儲備累積過程中的風險承擔，以及外匯市場行為等。\n- 香港金融管理局、美國聯邦準備理事會（Federal Reserve Board）與亞特蘭大聯邦準備銀行（Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta）於10月聯合贊助舉辦了主題為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗總結」的研討會。該研討會回顧了過去十年主要央行所實施的非常規貨幣政策（UMP）所帶來的經驗教訓。議題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟與金融穩定的影響等。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out remotely.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n2017年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續將監管重點放在授權機構風險治理架構的有效性上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統。當年，香港金融管理局再推出一輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，以加強銀行業應對樓市下行風險的韌性。面對網絡威脅日益增加，香港金融管理局加強對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。同時，香港金融管理局推出了七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新時代做好準備。授權機構的反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施的有效性，仍是香港金融管理局重點監管的範疇，作為其打擊金融犯罪努力的一部分。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局進一步採取措施，推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融包容，並解決中小企業及初創公司在香港開設及維持銀行帳戶時遇到的困難。亦加強對授權機構銷售投資及保險產品的行為監管，以進一步加強對客戶的保護。\n\n在國際監管及會計標準的本地實施方面取得了實質性進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、淨穩定資金比率、大額風險敞口限制、壓力測試規劃以及國際財務報告準則第九號。為支持在不斷變化的銀行環境和演變中的風險形勢下加強能力建設的需求，香港金融管理專員處與業界協調，制定了董事授權計劃以及銀行業從業人員增強能力框架。\n\n《金融機構（解決）條例》於2017年7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨行業金融機構解決機制的金融穩定理事會成員管轄區之一。該條例建立了一道新的金融穩定防線，賦予貨幣當局在金融機構出現可能對系統產生不利影響的失敗情況時，以有序方式管理該機構失敗的必要權力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現這一目標有賴於金融體系具備高度的韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需的重要金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式，甚至在極端情況下以混亂方式失敗，都可能影響系統的穩定性。作為監管機構，貨幣當局在確保銀行具有抵禦衝擊的能力，並能在面對危機時恢復其地位，進而防止銀行失敗方面，發揮關鍵作用。貨幣當局負責香港銀行業務的審慎監管，包括吸收存款業務。貨幣當局亦負責授權香港的持牌銀行、受限制牌照銀行及吸收存款公司，這些機構統稱為獲授權機構（Authorized Institutions，簡稱AIs）。此外，貨幣當局亦負責指定及監管某些金融市場基礎設施（Financial Market Infrastructures，簡稱FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法確保，也從未設計香港審慎監管框架來確保零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣當局作為解決機構，旨在確保在出現金融機構失敗的情況下，能夠以有序的方式進行解決，從而維持這些金融機構向客戶提供的關鍵金融服務的連續性。為此，香港建立了金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局是包括金融機構在內的解決機構。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概述\n\n2017年進行了192次非現場審查，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括銀行的CAMEL評分1、公司治理、業務運作及風險管理。作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續推動銀行加強風險治理的措施之一，HKMA與銀行董事會或董事會級別委員會舉行了30次會談，討論重點風險管理議題。HKMA亦進行了一項調查，以監測銀行採納其最近有關公司治理指引的情況。此外，HKMA還與銀行及其外部核數師舉行了27次三方會談。\n\n除了離岸活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續進行常規的現場檢查，並針對評估風險較高的領域進行主題性審查。這種方法使香港金融管理局能夠優先配置監管資源，專注於銀行機構所面臨的潛在及更重大的風險。在這一年內，香港金融管理局進行了401次現場檢查和主題性審查。信貸風險管理與控制仍然是這些檢查和審查的主要重點。另一個主要重點是科技風險及營運風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加了海外檢查的數目，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制的現場檢查和主題性審查數目。此外，專門團隊亦對銀行機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n# 信貸風險監督\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n與2016年的6.5%增長相比，銀行總貸款額增長了16.1%。如表2所示，貸款增長範圍廣泛。\n\n具體而言，截至2017年底，與內地相關的貸款額增長17.5%，達到4,1880億港元（見表3）。其中，包括在香港註冊的銀行在內地子公司記賬的6440億港元貸款。\n\n2017年，銀行資產品質保持健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率由2016年底的0.72%微降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均水準2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，分類貸款比率由0.85%降至0.67%。至於與內地相關的貸款，零售銀行的該類貸款分類貸款比率由2016年的0.82%微降至2017年的0.75%。就整個銀行業而言，該比率則由去年同期的0.80%降至0.67%。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局加強了監管工作，以確保銀行持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是加強了對銀行對大型企業風險敞口的監測。進行了針對性的主題檢查，重點包括信貸風險管理的關鍵控制措施，如貸款審批標準、貸款分類及撥備制度、信貸風險治理架構，以及對房地產發展商、資產擔保融資和保險費融資的信貸風險管理。\n\n# 不動產抵押貸款\n\n2017年樓價持續上升。人工智能機構（AIs）發放的貸款中，涉及擁有多個按揭或收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人數量增加。鑒於這些發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於5月19日推出了另一輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高人工智能機構計算新住宅按揭貸款資本負擔時的風險權重下限，降低對已有按揭的借款人發放物業按揭貸款的貸款與價值比率（LTV）上限，以及降低對收入主要來自香港以外地區的借款人發放物業按揭貸款的債務償還比率（DSR）限制。\n\n自2009年起，香港金融管理局（HKMA）針對樓宇按揭貸款所實施的宏觀審慎措施，增強了銀行對樓市相關風險的應對能力。在反週期措施首次推出前，即2009年9月，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與估值比率（LTV）為64%，至2017年12月已降至49%。貸款與收入比率（DSR）的平均值亦由2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%，降至2017年12月的35%（見圖1）。\n\n香港金融管理局注意到，一些發展商以高槓桿率為其物業發展項目融資，而其中一些發展商亦向物業買家提供高貸款與價值比率（LTV）的按揭貸款。為應對與這些發展項目相關的風險，香港金融管理局於5月12日推出了針對向物業發展商貸款的新風險管理措施。這些措施包括要求持牌機構降低建設融資的融資上限；要求持牌機構為其向貸款比例較股權較高的物業發展商提供的貸款，撥備更多資本；以及進行一輪主題檢查，以確保銀行在向物業發展商貸款時，持續遵循謹慎的信貸審批標準。\n\n另外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於二月與地政總署合作推出了電子警報服務（e-Alert service）。此電子警報服務會在地政總署接獲有關按揭財產的進一步按揭登記申請時，即時通知相關的按揭代理機構，使銀行按揭機構能夠根據情況採取適當的風險緩衝措施。\n\n# 業務及科技風險監督\n\n網絡安全威脅在一年內持續增加。香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了監管措施，以提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為香港金融管理局於2016年推出的「網絡安全強化計劃」（CFI）的一部分，30間銀行完成了對其網絡防禦成熟度的評估。另外，香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）在與銀行及證券業進行廣泛諮詢後，共同決定推行網上股票交易的強制雙重驗證。同時，還進行了一輪針對銀行網絡安全控制及運營韌性的現場檢查。此外，香港金融管理局進一步與主要銀行的高層管理人員進行了一輪討論，以評估銀行如何應對由技術進步所推動的潛在新市場參與者所帶來的戰略風險。\n\n# 智能銀行\n\n九月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）宣布了一系列措施，協助香港銀行業邁向智慧銀行的新時代。在監管方面，香港金融管理局將金融科技監管沙盒升級至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行與科技公司均可使用的聊天室設施，以及建立香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監理服務委員會（SFC）和保險業監理處（IA）沙盒之間的聯繫，以提供一個單一入口，進行跨行業金融科技產品的測試。\n\n香港金融管理局亦推出了「銀行服務簡化」計劃，旨在識別並減少監管摩擦，進一步改善客戶使用金融科技及數字銀行服務的體驗。目前已成立專責小組，重點關注遠程開戶及賬戶管理、網上理財及網上資產管理。\n\n現已開始審視現行《虛擬銀行授權指引》，以促進香港虛擬銀行業的發展。\n\n# 國庫活動監督與流動性風險\n\n當美國持續正常化其貨幣政策時，全球資金流動可能會變得越來越波動。鑒於此，香港金融管理局（HKMA）在本年度更加重視對流動性風險的監管。香港金融管理局通過增加更多情景，包括更嚴峻但合理的資金外流情景以及短期、信心驅動的銀行擠提情景，來加強其流動性壓力測試的監管。此外，香港金融管理局也加強了對個別持牌機構流動性狀況的監測與分析，並要求部分持牌機構提升其流動性風險管理能力。\n\n此外，金管局就銀行的債務證券投資組合，進行了更多有關市場風險管理的現場檢查。金管局還進行了一輪主題性審查，以評估銀行增加外幣債券投資活動所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相關風險管理措施，包括對沖做法的成效。\n\n# 防止洗錢及資助恐怖主義（ML\/TF）\n\n《2017年反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例》於6月23日刊憲，並將於2018年開始實施。此次修訂旨在根據金融行動特別工作組（FATF）最新頒佈的國際要求，更新香港的反洗錢及反恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）監管制度。這些更改，配合有關AML\/CFT的法定指引更新，將有助於明確並落實以風險為本的客戶盡職調查（CDD）程序，包括開戶及維護誠實客戶的過程，並鼓勵在遠程進行這些程序時進行創新。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nTo consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre, the HKMA strives to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. On fintech, the seven new initiatives aimed at facilitating the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries were well received by stakeholders and the public. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new level.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，香港金融管理局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，七項新措施旨在促進銀行及支付行業內金融科技的發展與應用，獲得業界及公眾的廣泛好評。由於在這方面進行了一系列網絡建設與能力建設的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際地位進一步提升。債券通的推出更進一步鞏固了香港作為通往中國內地機會主門戶的地位。香港金融管理局在企業財務中心等其他領域的努力也開始見到成效。\n\n# 概述\n\n鑑於科技迅速發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於九月宣布推出七項措施，為香港邁向智慧銀行新時代作好準備。這些措施包括：  \n- 發展更快支付系統（FPS），以實現數碼零售支付的全面連通；  \n- 引入開放應用程式介面（Open API）框架；  \n- 加強金融科技研究及人才發展；  \n- 增進跨境金融科技合作；  \n- 升級現有的金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）1.0至2.0版本；  \n- 促進虛擬銀行的引入；以及  \n- 推動「銀行服務更便捷」新計劃，以減少客戶在數碼體驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO）與香港金融管理局的銀行部門在推動這些計劃的落實方面發揮了關鍵作用，進一步鞏固香港作為亞洲金融科技中心的地位。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際地位進一步提升，香港按揭證券有限公司基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的合作伙伴數目，由2018年1月31日的約40間增至87間。在這一年間，IFFO舉辦及參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，促進關鍵利益相關者之間的經驗交流和合作網絡建設。特別是，IFFO在首次舉行的債務融資及投資者座談會上，推動制定了一份基礎設施股權投資參考條款清單，旨在提高基礎設施項目的銀行可貸性及投資吸引力。\n\n債券通於七月啟動，標誌著香港與內地資本市場相互開放的又一重大里程碑，進一步鞏固了香港作為國際投資者進入內地市場門戶的地位。當年，香港人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）額度由2700億元人民幣增至5000億元人民幣。香港繼續保持全球最大離岸人民幣流動性池，人民幣金融中介活動活躍，體現在我們的人民幣實時全額清算（RTGS）系統交易額高企，以及香港在全球人民幣支付活動中佔據主導地位。\n\n自2016年推出企業財務中心（CTC）稅務制度後，香港金融管理局（HKMA）加強了外展工作，旨在吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立財務中心。截至2017年底，已有超過40間企業向HKMA反映，他們正積極計劃在香港設立財務中心，或已經設立了相關業務。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極參與國際有關全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題的討論。香港金融管理局局長於四月擔任金融穩定理事會（FSB）監管與監督合作常設委員會（SRC）主席，領導有關關鍵金融穩定問題的討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，為香港作為國際金融中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色奠定了堅實基礎。2017年，四個銀行間實時全額清算系統（RTGS）及中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）的系統可用率達到100%，高於預設目標99.95%。為支持債券通的北向交易，CMU已在兩家內地中央證券存管機構（CSD）開設賬戶，以協助相關CMU成員進行債券通交易的結算，並代為持有內地債務證券。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業界的整體安全與效率，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於八月根據《支付系統及儲值憑證設施條例》（PSSVFO）指定四個零售支付系統（RPS），使其運作納入香港金融管理局的監管範圍。香港金融管理局亦對16間積極推出新產品及服務的儲值憑證設施（SVF）持牌機構進行監管，以為客戶提供更多選擇及更佳的用戶體驗。另外，電子支票及電子帳單呈交及支付（EBPP）服務的覆蓋範圍進一步擴展，涵蓋香港與廣東省內所有跨境支付。\n\n# 2017年回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技中心\n\n# 智能銀行措施\n\n鑑於科技迅速發展，香港金融管理局於九月宣布了七項措施，以協助香港邁向智慧銀行的新時代。這些措施旨在推動銀行業邁向更高層次，把握銀行與科技融合所帶來的龐大機遇。\n\n「智慧銀行將提供零售與企業客戶之間的全面互聯互通，並允許以高度的流動性、速度、便捷性和安全性進行金融服務與交易。」\n\n香港金融管理局一直與銀行業及金融科技界密切合作，在落實七項倡議方面已取得良好進展。\n\n# 更快速的支付系統\n\nFPS 是一個多幣種平台，將讓公眾能夠透過手機號碼或電郵地址，輕鬆實時進行全天候的資金轉賬。該系統支持港幣及人民幣支付。銀行及非銀行支付服務供應商均可參與 FPS，實現所有支付參與者的全面互聯。系統開發工作已接近完成，FPS 計劃於 2018 年 9 月推出。\n\n此外，香港金融管理局領導了一個工作小組，該小組由主要信用卡方案營運商、銀行、持牌SVF營運商及商戶收單機構組成，旨在為香港零售支付建立統一的二維碼標準。統一的二維碼標準將有助商戶使用單一的二維碼接受來自多個支付服務提供者的二維碼支付方案，為顧客和商戶帶來更大便利。該工作小組已最終確定相關技術規範，並會制定具體的實施安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放式 API 允許第三方存取銀行的數據，以促進銀行及其他產業所提供服務的更好整合與更便捷的接合。因此，用戶可以方便地留在同一系統中，在安全的環境中享受整合服務。為促進銀行業採用開放式 API 的發展，香港金融管理局（HKMA）擬訂了一項開放式 API 架構草案，內容包括一組開放式 API 功能、部署時間表、技術標準、第三方服務供應商的治理、促進措施及維護模式，並進行為期兩個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n其中一個主要的研究專案是關於分散式帳本技術（DLT）。繼2016年第一份DLT白皮書之後，第二份DLT白皮書於2017年10月發布。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三個概念驗證（Proof-of-Concept）專案，即貿易融資、數位身分管理與房貸申請。此外，該白皮書亦針對銀行與支付產業部署DLT時所涉及的治理、法律合規及一般控制原則等實施問題，提出相關建議。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖在金管局金融科技日宣布發佈有關區塊鏈技術的第二份白皮書。\n\n香港金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證工作取得成功後，香港七家銀行決定將原型系統商業化，並命名為「香港貿易融資平台」（Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform，HKTFP），以數字化和共享貿易文件、自動化流程，從而改善整體貿易流程，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險和詐騙。\n\n為擴大金融科技產業的人才庫，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年12月與香港應用科學及科技研究院合作推出了「金融科技職業加速計劃」。學生反應熱烈，共收到421名申請者逾3,000份申請。最終，有74名學生接受了來自香港金融管理局及12間銀行的實習機會，從7月開始參與金融科技相關項目，實習期為六個月或一年。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n為加強粵港澳大灣區內的合作，我們首先與深圳合作，推動金融科技及人才發展。具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市金融發展服務辦公室於六月簽訂協議，內容包括：（一）為金融科技公司提供相互的軟著陸支持；（二）於十月共同舉辦深港金融科技獎，以表彰和獎勵兩地優秀的金融科技產品和解決方案；以及（三）為香港學生安排在深圳的金融科技及科技金融公司進行暑期實習。\n\n香港按揭證券有限公司行政總裁陳德潤（中）在香港按揭證券金融科技日與OFDS總幹事何小軍（左）及數碼港主席李國能博士簽署並交換關於軟著陸安排的備忘錄。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎電子簡報傳單\n\n香港金管局亦與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及迪拜金融服務局簽署金融科技合作協議，涵蓋創新項目、創新企業轉介、資訊共享及專業知識交流等內容。\n\n今年11月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進一步與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）簽署備忘錄，共同建設全球貿易聯繫網絡（GTCN），將新加坡國家貿易平台與香港貿易通平台（HKTFP）連接起來，形成跨境分布式賬本（DLT）基礎設施，以數字化跨境貿易和貿易融資流程，使其更安全、更高效且更具成本效益。該平台將是一個開放式平台，允許其他有興趣的司法管轄區未來參與。GTCN預計將於2019年第一季度推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2016年9月推出的金融科技督导小组（FSS）已升級為FSS 2.0，以加快與銀行及科技公司之間的溝通，促進新想法和新計劃的產生。具體而言，FSS 2.0具有以下新功能：\n- 設立金融科技監管聊天室，以便在金融科技項目的早期階段向銀行和科技公司提供反饋。\n- 科技公司可以通過聊天室尋求反饋，而無需經由銀行即可接觸FSS。\n- 香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監理機搆（SFC）和保險業監理機構的沙盒已實現聯動，使跨行業金融科技產品的試驗試行能夠有一個單一的入口點。\n\n截至2017年底，已有28種新技術產品在FSS中進行測試。其中，14項試點試驗已完成，相關產品後續已陸續推向市場。\n\n# 銀行業簡化計劃\n\n為減少阻礙科技創新之監管摩擦，已推出「簡化銀行業務」計劃。目前已成立專案小組，重點關注以下領域：\n- 遠程開戶與賬戶管理\n- 線上金融\n- 線上財富管理\n\n# 虛擬銀行\n\n沒有實體分行的虛擬銀行預計將為香港金融科技的應用提供額外動力，並在行動和數字銀行方面提供一種全新的客戶體驗。由於虛擬銀行通常針對零售市場，無論是個人還是中小企業（SMEs），它們也可能有助於促進金融包容性。香港金融管理局（HKMA）已開始審視現行的《虛擬銀行授權指引》，以促進虛擬銀行在香港的推出。\n\n# 智慧銀行的新時代\n\n# 監督與創新\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）去年提出的七項推動香港邁向智慧銀行新時代的倡議，是一個涉及HKMA內多個部門合作的大型項目。隨著金融科技成為不可逆轉的趨勢，香港金融管理局總裁（銀行監管）陳德霖表示，作為監管機構，HKMA必須緊跟最新科技發展，適時調整監管思維與方法，以將銀行服務及客戶體驗提升至新層次。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations. During the year, the HKMA continued to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. In 2017, 86 open press events were organised, comprising nine press conferences, 16 stand-up interviews and 61 other public functions. In addition, 42 media interviews were arranged and a total of 360 bilingual press releases were issued. It also handles a large number of media enquiries every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, guided tours were organised for the media to visit the newly revamped HKMA Information Centre. Furthermore, indepth media briefings and educational workshops were conducted for local and overseas media on a wide range of topics, including the Bond Connect scheme, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, the Resolution Regime and Exchange Fund investments.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, introduces a mosaic artwork called “Small Change, Big Ode” to the media at the HKMA Information Centre. The artwork, featuring the Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, was created using a total of 135,811 pieces of Hong Kong coins in different denominations.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, conducts a media interview with local newspapers regarding the key initiatives of the HKMA’s Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and Fintech Facilitation Office.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n","zh":"# 基金會\n\n# 審計主任報告書\n\n# 獨立核數師報告書 致財政司司長\n\n# 評論\n\n我證明我已審計載於第157至243頁的香港交易所基金及其附屬公司（「該集團」）的財務報表，該財務報表包括香港交易所基金及該集團截至2017年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支賬戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，截至2017年12月31日止，基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，其財務報表均根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並符合根據《儲備基金條例》（第66章）第7條頒佈的行政長官指示，真實而公允地反映了基金及集團的財務狀況。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條所發出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行審計。我在這些標準下的責任，進一步載於我報告書中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與該集團保持獨立，並已按照這些標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據已足夠且適當，作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指依我專業判斷，在2017年12月31日止年度財務報表之審計過程中，最具重要性之事項。這些事項係於我審計財務報表整體之脈絡下加以處理，並作為我形成審計意見之基礎，我並未針對這些事項另行提出意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港貨幣當局2017年度報告中所載的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師對該等財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就該等資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在這樣做時考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否顯然存在重大錯誤。如果根據我所進行的工作，我認為這些其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我必須報告這一情況。在這方面，我沒有任何需要報告的內容。\n\n# 貨幣管理機構及匯兌基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會對財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《儲備基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，編製真實及公允地反映財務狀況的財務報表，並負責建立貨幣管理局認為對編製無重大錯報（無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致）財務報表所必需的內部控制措施。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營的能力，根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n香港儲備基金諮詢委員會的審計小組委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理確信，以確認財務報表整體是否沒有重大錯報，無論該錯報是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理確信是一種高水平的確信，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計始終能夠在存在重大錯報時予以發現。錯報可能來自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合併起來，合理預期會影響使用者基於這些財務報表所作出的經濟決策，則視為重大錯報。\n\n作為根據審計委員會審計標準進行審計的一部分，我在整個審計過程中行使專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我也：\n- 識別和評估財務報表存在重大錯報的風險，無論是因舞弊還是錯誤所致，並設計和執行針對這些風險的審計程序，以取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。未能發現因舞弊導致的重大錯報風險，高於因錯誤導致的重大錯報風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制；\n- 為了設計適合情況的審計程序，我會了解與審計相關的內部控制，但並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n- 對貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎會計的適當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在我的審計報告中引起注意財務報表中相關的披露，或如果這些披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至審計報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能導致集團無法持續經營；\n- 評估財務報表整體的呈報、結構和內容，包括披露，以及財務報表是否以實現公正呈報的方式反映其底層交易和事項；以及\n- 取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表財務報表意見。我對集團審計的指揮、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我就審計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷等事項，與財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會進行溝通。\n\n我也向基金會諮詢委員會的審計小組委員會提交一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用的情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的資料，我確定在本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，因此為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果合理預期會超過此類披露所帶來的公眾利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n孫大衛  \n審計總監\n\n2018年4月11日\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（基金）管理人的授權，貨幣管理機構根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動是維護香港貨幣的匯兌價值，以及保持香港貨幣和金融體系的穩定與完整。\n\n基金的資產分為四個組合進行管理：擔保組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。根據香港貨幣局制度，擔保組合的資產完全與貨幣基礎相匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合則持有香港特別行政區政府為基金戰略目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份。營運部門的資訊請參閱附註30。\n\n# 2. 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係根據所有適用之香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製而成，香港財務報告準則係一項總稱，包括所有適用之個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港資深會計師公會（HKICPA）所頒佈之解釋。此外，亦包括在香港一般被接受之會計原則。以下為基金及其附屬公司（合稱為「集團」）採用之重要會計政策摘要。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的及修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次生效或可供在本期會計期間提前採用。附註3載列了因採納這些發展而導致會計政策變更的資料（如有），並就這些變更對本期及往期會計期間（反映於這些財務報表中）對集團的相關性作出說明。\n\n# 2.2 準備財務報表的基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司和合營企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，惟下列資產及負債係按其公允價值列示，詳情請參閱下文所述會計政策：\n- 交易性金融工具（註2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（註2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供出售證券（註2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（註2.11）；及\n- 投資性不動產（註2.12）。\n\n按照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些判斷、估計和假設會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和開支的報告金額。這些估計和相關假設是基於經驗及在當時情況下認為合理的各種其他因素，其結果構成了對資產和負債攜帶價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值從其他來源並不容易得知。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及其相關假設會持續進行審查。若估計數字的修改僅影響當期，則於當期確認；若修改同時影響當期及未來期間，則於修改當期及未來期間確認。\n\n附註18載有與投資性物業公允價值估算相關的假設資訊。附註36載有與金融工具公允價值估算相關的假設資訊。除涉及這些公允價值估算的會計判斷外，集團會計政策的應用中沒有其他關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是指由集團所控制的實體。當集團對某實體擁有控制權時，即表示集團因參與該實體而暴露於或擁有來自該實體的變動報酬，且集團能透過對該實體的權力來影響這些報酬。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他各方所持有）。\n"}
