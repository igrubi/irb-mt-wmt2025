{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","zh":"# 2015 年重點回顧\n\n# 經濟與財政環境\n\n香港經濟增長放緩，反映本地需求較弱及出口表現平淡。本地股市在國際金融市場波動加劇的情況下面臨大幅波動。住宅樓市在二月第七輪審慎措施公佈後開始放緩。\n\n香港銀行業依然具備韌性。本地註冊的持牌機構（AIs）資本充足，其流動性狀況持續穩健。零售銀行的資產質素略有惡化，但整體仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n港元兌美元匯率大致穩定，今年四月、九月及十月多次觸發強方貨幣發鈔承擔機制。儘管全球金融市場環境動盪，港元匯率市場仍持續有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度對外來衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。在美國聯邦儲備委員會決定提高聯邦基金利率目標範圍後，香港基準利率於十二月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n針對人工智慧的風險治理監督措施已加強，包括信貸與流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢與打擊恐怖主義融資的控制措施，以及投資和保險產品的銷售行為。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布為香港設立逆週期資本緩衝機制，並指定五家授權機構為本地系統重要銀行。香港立法會分別引入立法建議，以建立香港金融機構的解決機制，並通過加快賠償發放來加強存款保障計劃。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及區域論壇，同時不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。為改善稅務環境以推動香港成為企業財務中心樞紐，相關立法建議於十二月提交至立法會。\n\n香港仍然是全球離岸人民幣業務的樞紐，擁有深度和廣度俱備的市場。內地與香港基金互認計劃於七月實施，進一步擴展香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施進一步得到加強，因為電子支票服務於十二月成功推出，讓客戶可以網上發出及存入支票。一套新的監管制度將於十一月開始實施，該制度允許發放多用途儲值設施的牌照，並指定重要的零售支付系統。\n\n# 储備管理  \n在充滿挑戰和困難的投資環境中，儲備基金錄得整體投資回報率為-0.6%。截至2015年底，基金總資產達到3,4229億港元。\n\n香港金融管理局加快投資多元化進程，特別是透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）進行的投資。截至2015年底，LTGP下的投資市值總計達1421億港元，其中包括913億港元的私募股權投資及508億港元的房地產投資，未償還的投資承諾金額達1224億港元。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他各種渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策和運作的了解。為進一步改善公司治理，管理局支持員工專業發展，建立嚴謹的財務紀律，增強資訊安全，並重新分配高層管理人員的職責，以應對新措施實施及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與財政環境\n\n2015年香港經濟增長放緩，反映內需疲弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年經濟增長將在嚴峻的外部環境及脆弱的金融市場條件下持續疲軟。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港今年經濟增長有所放緩，實際國內生產總值（GDP）增幅由2014年的2.6%降至2.4%（表1）。這反映出本地需求擴張趨緩，儘管淨出口對GDP增長重新成為正向貢獻，因總進口額下降速度較總出口額更快（圖1）。儘管經濟表現相對平穩，勞動市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低水平。由於國內成本和進口價格的壓力減緩，通脹進一步緩和。在國際金融市場波動加劇的情況下，本地股市出現大幅波動。在二月宣布第七輪審慎措施後，住宅樓市開始放緩，至年底樓價進一步顯示出盤整跡象。\n\n圖表1 按貢獻分列的實際本地生產總值增長  \n來源：統計處\n\n表1 按支出項目計算的實際國內生產總值成長率（環比）\n\n註：經季節調整後的國內生產總值固定資本形成季對季變動率不可用。\n來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與財政環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年匯率穩定，港元兌美元匯率維持在約7.75附近。由於股權相關資金流入，強方貨幣兌換承擔於4月被觸發，9月和10月再次被觸發，反映離岸人民幣兌換港元以及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總結餘規模擴大，本地利率持續保持低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率在12月中旬美國加息後，由0.5%調高至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩，由2014年的12.7%降至2015年的3.5%。銀行業整體貸款質素略有惡化，但分類貸款比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年內需增長速度放緩。儘管整體就業和收入狀況持續穩定，為經濟提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱以及資產價格的修正，對年內下半年私人消費增長造成壓力。然而，由於上半年增長動能相對強勁，全年私人消費增長率從2014年的3.3%提高至4.8%。政府消費則以3.4%的增速小幅加快。事實上，內需增長放緩主要歸因於國內固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（見圖2）。私人部門機械設備購置連續第二年出現下滑，企業經營環境惡化是主要原因，同時建築與工程活動也因公共工程進展較慢而顯示出較弱的增長動能。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年惡化（圖表3）。貨物出口出現全面下滑，錄得1.7%的跌幅，為自2009年以來首次出現下跌。對日本和歐盟的出口下降，而對美國的出口則增長有限。這些先進市場疲弱的最終需求也拖累區域內工業活動和區域內貿易。因此，香港對中國內地、新加坡、韓國和台灣的出口亦因這些經濟體中間需求和最終需求疲弱而下降。香港的服務出口則從早年高增長軌道持續放緩，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的跌幅，主要由於入境旅遊需求的減緩。貨物進口亦因國內及出口引致的需求疲弱而回落。相比之下，服務進口的增長則因本地居民強勁的旅遊興趣而加快。從淨出口來看，整體貿易順差在2015年略有改善，對GDP增長作出輕微正面貢獻。\n\n圖表2 內地需求  \n來源：統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n在2015年，由於國內成本壓力減緩以及進口物價通脹下降，核心通脹進一步緩和。扣除政府一次性紓困措施的影響後，核心通脹率由2014年的3.5%降至2.5%（見圖4）。在經濟活動較為低迷的情況下，工資成本壓力保持穩定，而商業及工業租賃成本壓力則有所緩和，尤其是在下半年。由於全球大宗商品價格回落以及港元強勢，進口物價壓力減輕，同時食品通脹亦保持在低水平。由於早前季度新落成住宅租金的傳導效果較為溫和，因此通脹中的租賃成分仍然受到控制。\n\n圖表3 貿易貨物及服務出口  \n來源：統計處\n\n圖4 基本消費者物價膨脹  \n來源：統計處\n\n# 經濟與財政環境\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2015年勞動市場狀況保持穩定。勞動需求持續堅挺，雖然貿易和旅遊相關產業就業人數有所下降，但其他商業領域的聘僱速度穩定，使總體就業人數較去年同期增加1.3%。由於勞動供給也增加1.3%，經季節調整後的失業率全年維持在約3.3%（圖表5）。鑑於勞動市場依然緊張，今年前三個季度名義勞動報酬較去年同期上升4.7%，高於2014年的4.3%。隨著通脹壓力緩和，今年前三個季度實際勞動報酬較去年同期增加1.3%，而2014年同期則是下降0.1%。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n由於外部環境發生劇烈變化，香港股市經歷了一個波動的一年。在第一季度持平後，第二季度本地股市在內地A股市場樂觀情緒及資金流入的推動下表現強勁。恒生指數在4月攀升至七年來的新高，自2014年11月滬港通南向每日額度設立以來，首次在當月用盡每日額度（見圖6）。然而，從6月下旬開始，本地股市走勢轉為下跌，受內地A股市場及全球股市拋售、全球外匯市場波動加劇以及國際大宗商品價格疲軟等因素影響，恒生指數在9月跌至一年低點，跌幅達28%。到了第四季度，隨著全球及內地金融市場逐漸穩定，香港股市有所回升。整體而言，2015年恒生指數下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差表現，而日均成交額則從2014年的695億港元上升至1056億港元。儘管下半年集資活動有所減緩，但本地股市整體集資額仍從去年同期的9427億港元增加至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅房地产市場出現了整固跡象。在2015年初經歷了一段活躍期後，住宅房地產市場於二月第七輪審慎措施公布後開始放緩。雖然房價在去年第四季之前上漲速度放緩，但隨後開始下跌，2015年全年房價累計上漲2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%（圖6）。同時，交易量較去年同期下降12.3%，降至55,982單位，因二線市場交易活動在下半年明顯減少。投機性交易，包括確認交易和短期炒房交易，持續保持在低水平。儘管如此，家庭購房負擔仍然沉重，價格與收入比達到15.7，收入負擔比率仍遠高於其長期平均水準。商業及工業房地產市場在上半年表現活躍，但隨後交易活動放緩，價格和租金在去年第四季均出現下跌。租金回報率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖6 資產價格  \n來源：評級及估值部及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 經濟與財政環境\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計香港2016年的經濟增長將保持疲弱。私人機構分析師預測經濟將以較慢的平均速度擴張1.7%，而政府則預計增長幅度在1%至2%之間。更具體而言，全球增長前景疲弱、入境旅遊持續低迷，以及全球金融市場動盪所帶來的負面溢出效應，將繼續抑制香港出口表現。在本地方面，私人消費預計會 moderate 增長，因為在經濟動能較弱的情況下，勞動市場條件可能面臨一些壓力，而本地資產價格調整可能會削弱消費者信心，並引發負面財富效應。建築和建設活動可能維持穩定，但企業信心疲弱和利率上升將對私人資本投資造成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n預計2016年通脹壓力將保持受控。進口價格壓力料將持續疲軟，而國內成本壓力在經濟增長動能適中之際預計亦屬溫和。由於2015年底新租住房屋租金壓力減緩，通脹中的租金成分也可能緩和。市場共識預測2016年整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府則預計核心通脹率為2.0%。受入境旅遊減緩及出口部門持續低迷影響，勞動市場也可能略微放緩。目前私人機構分析師預計2016年失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n二〇一六年經濟前景面臨多項不確定因素和風險。特別是美國利率進一步上調的節奏、全球增長前景以及大宗商品價格的波動，將繼續是主要的不確定來源。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場和國際資本流動的波動性，進而導致本地貨幣和金融條件趨緊，並對香港的增長前景造成影響。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將在很大程度上取決於它們對樓市通過財富效應和資產負債表效應的影響。儘管樓市正面臨來自全球和本地金融市場情緒轉弱、美國利率正常化以及樓市供應與需求差距收窄等因素所帶來的下行風險，但目前仍需更多時間來判斷樓市是否已進入下行週期。雖然樓市出現突然調整可能對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但近年來引入的反週期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已大幅增強了香港銀行體系的韌性。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n儘管先進經濟體的貨幣政策進一步分化，以及新興市場經濟體的脆弱性增加，香港銀行業在本年度仍保持韌性。獲授權機構（AIs）的流動性狀況持續穩健，本地註冊的AIs資本充足。零售銀行的資產質量略有惡化，但整體仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率趨勢\n\n與美元利率一致，港元銀行間利率全年均處於低位。零售銀行的港元資金成本在上半年因綜合利率呈下降趨勢而下降，下半年則保持穩定（圖7）。\n\n圖表7 香港銀行業議會拆息（HIBOR）、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率（BLR）  \n註釋：  \n1.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管2015年金融市場情況動盪，且美國在12月加息，港元匯率整體仍保持穩定。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充足。作為香港過去數十年來貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度持續對外來衝擊表現出高度的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在國際外匯市場上對美元的匯率穩定，匯率波動範圍為每美元7.75至7.85港元。香港的貨幣體系結構以貨幣局制度為特徵，要求貨幣基礎至少有100%由存放在匯兌基金中的美元儲備支持，並要求貨幣基礎的任何變化都必須由相應的美元儲備變化100%對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括\n\n* 債券，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供充分擔保  \n* 政府發行並流通行中的紙幣和硬幣  \n* 總結餘額，即銀行在港元銀行（HKMA）開設的清算賬戶餘額總和  \n* 港元銀行（HKMA）代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund 證券及債券\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行貨幣發行局承諾（Convertibility Undertakings, CUs）來維持的。當對港元的需求超過供應，市場匯率強升至強方貨幣發行局承諾水平，即每美元7.75港元時，香港金融管理局準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總結餘額隨之擴大，壓低港元利率，創造貨幣條件，使港元匯率從強方限制水平回調至7.75至7.85的貨幣發行區間內。相反地，若港元供應超過需求，市場匯率弱跌至弱方貨幣發行局承諾水平，即每美元7.85港元時，香港金融管理局將從銀行購入港元。總結餘額隨之收縮，推高港元利率，使港元匯率從弱方限制水平回調，維持在7.75至7.85的貨幣發行區間內。\n\n本處所列的債務證書以及流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣，均以港幣面值表示。本年度報告中匯兌基金的資產負債表所顯示的對應項目，以港幣表示，相當於根據資產負債表日期的匯率，兌換所需美元金額。此安排符合香港普遍接受的會計原則。\n\n這裡顯示的EFBN金額與本年度報告中證券基金的資產負債表所載金額不同。根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表證券基金進行EFBN二級市場交易時所持有的EFBN，會與發行的EFBN相互抵銷，淨額記錄在資產負債表中。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 汇率穩定性\n\n2015年，港元兌美元匯率大致保持穩定，在7.7500至7.7657之間窄幅波動（見圖1）。2015年初，市場對美國加息的擔憂令港元受到輕微貶值壓力。然而，第二季期間，港元匯率回升至接近7.75水平，主要由於股市活動活躍，促使與股權相關的港元需求急增，導致4月多次觸發強方貨幣發鈔（CU）。進入年中後，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著跌勢，以及全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動性增加，港元兌美元匯率在8月仍持續維持於接近7.75水平。9月及10月，由於離岸人民幣兌港元的轉換增加，強方CU再次被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25個基點，但港元兌美元匯率仍維持在狹窄範圍內波動，沒有出現顯著資金外流壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場環境動盪，2015年港元匯率市場運作有序。\n\n圖表1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於強方兌換率在四月、九月及十月屢次觸發，香港金融管理局根據貨幣發行局原則，被動地從銀行購入總額293億美元，換取2,272億港元。這導致總結餘相應擴展，其中部分擴展被銀行對流動性管理的強烈需求所引發的發鈔基金債券額外發行所抵銷（圖2）。發鈔基金紙幣的額外發行與貨幣發行局原則一致，因為這代表貨幣基礎組成的改變，而貨幣基礎則完全由外匯儲備支持。總結餘與未償還發鈔基金債券及紙幣總額由2014年底的9925億港元增至2015年底的1,2210億港元。\n\n圖表2 2015年總體結餘及未償還的外匯基金紙幣\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在香港銀行體系流動性充裕的情況下，2015年全年港元銀行間利率持續處於低位。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月16日（美國時間）由0至0.25%上調至0.25至0.5%後，根據預設公式，香港銀行利率亦於12月17日由0.5%上調至0.75%。整體而言，2015年港元銀行間利率從隔夜至三個月期均低於基本利率（見圖3），波動幅度較小，主要受銀行季節性流動性需求及八月金融市場波動導致流動性收緊所影響。廣泛追蹤香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）之間的利差，港元遠期點數在八月市場流動性收緊期間轉為明顯升水，但隨後由於美元利率普遍上調，至年底則轉為貼水（見圖4）。總體而言，貨幣市場運作正常，貼現窗口貸款活動並不活躍，2015年總額僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖表3 2015年香港銀行間利率\n\n圖表4 2015年港元遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年建立以來，聯繫匯率制度（LERS）一直運作順暢，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣和金融穩定作出了重要貢獻。鑒於香港經濟規模小、開放程度高，以及作為國際金融中心的角色，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最合適的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定致力於維持聯繫匯率制度。事實上，外匯和貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，公眾對港元作為支付手段和價值儲藏工具的信心依然強烈。在2015年與香港的第四條協議磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續支持聯繫匯率制度為香港最佳的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的制度、法律和政策框架、充足的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，是聯繫匯率制度順利運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑒於穩健的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監測銀行在信貸、流動性及利率風險管理方面的表現，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業貸款及與物業相關貸款的監管工作，以提升銀行體系的韌性。鑒於美國利率上升，香港金融管理局提醒公眾應做好風險管理的必要準備，指出任何觸發弱方連繫匯率（CU）及港元流出，都是港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高貨幣基金會帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產用以支持貨幣基礎。2015年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）在106.3%至107.5%的狹窄範圍內波動，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。截至12月31日，該比率為106.3%（見圖表5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，在聯繫匯率制度下，雖然已指定特定的外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。基金龐大的財務資源為應對突發衝擊，提供了強大的後盾，以保障香港的貨幣和金融穩定。\n\n圖表5 2015年Backing Ratio的每日波動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港金融管理局的儲備基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣局小組委員會負責監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的議題。2015年，該小組委員會審視的議題包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應情況、宏觀審慎措施的國際應用、美國加息對香港樓市的影響、基本利率的計算公式、香港美元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險。貨幣局小組委員會的討論紀錄及提交給該小組委員會的貨幣局運作報告，均會在香港金融管理局網站上發佈。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港金融研究機構（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域的研究。2015年，該機構贊助了16位研究員，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該機構舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會。其中主要的包括：\n\n* 2024年1月舉行的第六屆中國經濟國際研討會，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。會中發表了11篇高質量的研究論文，內容涵蓋中國企業槓桿、中國信貸泡沫與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供給等廣泛議題。\n* 2024年5月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦「HKIMR-HKU國際金融、制度與經濟增長研討會」。會中探討了多項經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場等。\n* 2024年10月，香港國際金融研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦準備理事會（聯準會）董事會、歐洲央行與達拉斯聯邦準備銀行合辦「分歧的貨幣政策、全球資本流動與金融穩定」研討會。會中探討了貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率之間的關係、分歧的貨幣政策對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等廣泛議題。\n\n該機構還於八月舉辦了第13屆香港國際金融研究中心暑期研討會，並於九月舉辦了第13屆中國內地經濟研討會，探討中國內地財政改革與地方政府融資等議題。這些會議和研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的參與者。此外，該機構在當年共舉辦了24場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 注釋與紙幣\n\n2015年底，流通中的紙幣總值為3602億港元，較一年前增長5.3％（圖表6、7和8）。流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣總值為112億港元，較一年前上升2.9％（圖表9和10）。流通中的政府發行10元紙幣總值為40億港元，其中85％為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將監管重點放在授權機構的風險治理上，包括信貸和流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資控制措施，以及投資和保險產品的銷售實踐。隨著系統性風險的累積，香港金融管理局於2016年1月1日宣布對香港實施0.625%的逆周期資本緩衝（並於2017年1月1日提高至1.25%）。有五間授權機構被指定為系統重要性銀行，將需承受更高的損失吸收資本緩衝。在《金融機構（解決）條例草案》提交立法會後，有關恢復與解決機制的改革取得了重大進展。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業界合作，以提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事和金融專業人員的技能與知識水平。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的跡象下，新興市場在2015年面臨更高的資本外流風險和較慢的經濟增長。為維持銀行體系在宏觀經濟環境可能突然惡化的狀況下的韌性，香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續密切監測授權機構（AIs）風險治理的有效性，以及其信貸和流動性風險管理系統。\n\n# 作業監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續採用監管方法，即在定期現場檢查的基礎上，增加主題性審查的數量。主題性審查是針對特定風險領域或特定活動，對選定的持牌機構進行深入的非現場審查。這種方法使香港金融管理局能夠優先配置監管資源，專注於持牌機構出現的較為重要及顯著的風險。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）共進行了193次現場檢查。鑒於銀行機構貸款組合的資產質量出現惡化的跡象，HKMA針對信貸風險管理及資產質量進行了更深入的主題性現場檢查。此外，鑒於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分歧所帶來的市場不確定性，HKMA亦增加了對財務相關活動的檢查次數。HKMA亦對與內地業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，以及銀行機構的內部評分基礎（IRB）模型進行了現場檢查。此外，專門團隊亦在本年度對銀行機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場檢查。\n\n此外，共進行了152項主題性的非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查類似的範圍。表1列出了運作監督工作的詳細資料。\n\n2015年，共進行了196次非現場審查，以評估銀行機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務經營情況。監管重點包括風險治理、資本規劃、企業信貸及巴塞爾III標準的落實監督。監管團隊持續與所選銀行機構的董事會及外部審計師保持密切聯繫。與銀行機構的高層管理人員及外部審計師舉行了20次三方會議，同時與所選銀行機構的董事會或董事會級別委員會舉行了23次會議。\n\n銀行監理審查委員會審議了四個案例，均涉及人工智能的授權問題。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源以處理各種優先事項，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求持牌銀行聘請外部審計師跟進可能對監管構成重大影響的問題。2015年，香港金融管理局根據此條款委聘了六份報告。其中兩份報告涉及反洗錢／反恐融资（AML\/CFT）控制措施，另外兩份報告涉及私人銀行業務，其餘則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等領域有關。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n2015年，沒有任何銀行機構違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動比率的規定。雖然根據《銀行條例》的不同條文共有84項違規情況，但均未影響存款人的利益，且已由銀行機構迅速糾正。\n\n表1 操作監督\n\n# 根據《銀行條例》第52條的權力\n\nMellifont銀行有限公司仍受《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權力管轄。2008年6月25日，貨幣當局根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對Mellifont銀行有限公司香港分行的事務、業務及財產所作出的指示，在本年度內仍然有效。香港金融管理局將繼續與有關當局保持定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總行相關的發展情況，並會密切留意所採取的監管措施，以保障該銀行存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL評分審查\n\nCAMEL核准委員會審查並確定金融機構的綜合CAMEL評分。金融機構已被告知評分結果，並有機會要求複審。在該年度內，沒有任何機構提出複審要求。\n\n# 專門監督工作\n\n# 業務及科技風險監督\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續根據新興風險和行業發展，發佈新的或更新的營運及科技風險管理指引。特別是，香港金融管理局已完成有關電子銀行（e-banking）的監管政策手冊（SPM）模塊的修訂，使銀行機構在提供新的電子銀行服務方面擁有更大的靈活性。此外，香港金融管理局亦發佈了有關網絡安全的通函，重申銀行機構董事會及高層管理人員需對有效的網絡安全風險管理進行監督的重要性。香港金融管理局亦定期發佈「營運事件觀察」，重點介紹所選詐騙案例或營運事件的作案手法，以及所發現的控制弱點。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了以風險為本的主題現場及非現場監管審查，以評估選定的持牌機構（AIs）在企業層面或特定業務範疇內的營運及科技風險管理情況。這些審查涵蓋了與持牌機構營運風險管理架構、網絡安全風險管理、防止異常交易活動的控制措施、對重要外包服務供應商的監督、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢的科技控制措施等相關的特定範疇。這些監管審查亦由年度獨立合規評審作為補充，評審內容包括營運風險管理架構、科技風險管理（包括客戶資料保護）及業務持續性計劃，其中選定的持牌機構需聘請獨立且具資格的評審人員，檢查其相關控制措施的充分性，並修復所發現的弱點。香港金融管理局亦識別並分析了持牌機構營運及科技風險的趨勢及監管重點，特別針對在維持香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定和有效運作方面發揮重要作用的持牌機構。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）監督銀行業在2015年底完成以晶片為基礎的自動櫃員機（ATM）技術的最後階段實施，該技術使發卡機構（AIs）完成了純信用卡的換卡過程。香港金融管理局亦要求發卡機構實施認證控制措施，以進一步提升「無卡交易」信用卡交易的安全性。另外，在接獲報告指某些非接觸式信用卡中儲存的持卡人姓名可能被隱秘地存取後，香港金融管理局要求有關發卡機構立即採取行動，通知並保護受影響的持卡人。香港金融管理局投入資源向公眾宣傳和解釋事件的規模及影響，以緩解公眾擔憂，並監督發卡機構的糾正措施，包括及時更換受影響的卡片。\n\n香港金融管理局與業界及其他持份者合作推行多項措施，包括舉辦提高公眾對網銀安全措施認識的宣傳活動、建立分享網絡安全情報的平台，以及為香港金融服務業務連續性管理論壇舉辦的危機管理演習提供支持和建議，該演習涉及多家銀行機構及其他金融機構。\n\n# 財富管理及強積金相關業務的監管\n\n香港金融管理局與香港其他金融監管機構密切合作，就證券、投資產品、保險產品及強制性公積金計劃的銷售，向持牌機構提供指引並進行監管。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融監管機構理事會的框架下，與監管機構保持定期聯繫。這些會議涵蓋了金融服務業不同領域中，業務關係密切的金融集團或受規管實體所涉及的各項議題，以確保監管行動更加協調和有效。\n\n在本年度內，金管局進行了25項現場及非現場主題檢查，以及15項非現場監察，對持牌機構進行審視。這些檢查涵蓋了投資產品的銷售、證券交易結算的處理及客戶證券的安全保管，以及非連結長期保險（NLTI）產品和強積金（MPF）相關產品的銷售，涉及零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶。\n\n八月，金管局發出通函給持牌機構，就向客戶銷售非壽險投資產品時的適合性評估及產品資訊披露提供指引。該指引旨在協助持牌機構遵守監管標準，包括保險業監理處及香港保險業聯會於七月發出的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續與財政司司長辦公室（FSTB）密切合作，參與《2014年保險公司（修訂）條例草案》的立法過程，以建立一個獨立的保險局，以及對保險中介人實施法定的牌照制度。2015年7月，立法會通過了《2015年保險公司（修訂）條例》，其中規定透過授權，賦予金融管理局對保險中介人（AIs）的保險中介活動進行檢查和調查的權力。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）處理了六項申請，以成為註冊機構（RIs），以及一項由註冊機構提出的申請，以從事額外的受規管活動。該局批准了204名負責監督註冊機構證券活動的高級人員的資格，並對由註冊機構提交、用於納入香港金融管理局所維護的登記冊的9,697名個人進行了背景調查。\n\n# 國庫活動監督\n\n在香港金融管理局（HKMA）的監管重點中，人工智能機構（AIs）的流動性風險管理始終佔據重要地位，特別是在美國利率預期正常化以及隨後資金流動可能出現反轉的情況下，這可能會對AIs的流動性狀況產生影響。2015年全年，HKMA持續推行針對AIs的加強版穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金來支持貸款業務。自2015年1月1日起實施巴塞爾III流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）以來，HKMA一直監測第一類機構的LCR水平及趨勢，這些機構一般維持LCR接近或超過100%，遠高於根據過渡安排於2015年設定的法定最低標準60%。\n\n此外，金管局對選定的銀行進行了主題性的現場檢查，重點審視其管理預期利率正常化相關風險的控制架構。在市場波動期間，金管局亦密切關注市場突變及其對銀行業及個別銀行的影響，並採取了適當的後續行動。\n\n# 監督主導的壓力測試計劃\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續推行由監管機構主導的自下而上的壓力測試計劃，以更深入了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端及不利經濟情況下的韌性，並鼓勵它們制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的計劃。今年引入了若干改進措施，以收集更細緻的資料，從而更深入地了解所選領域的風險動態。香港金融管理局分析了參與機構提交的測試結果，並與它們討論如何進一步改善壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n前幾年所觀察到的信貸快速增長趨勢，自2015年下半年起已經減緩。就全年而言，銀行部門的總貸款額增加3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降（見表2）。由於客戶存款的增長速度超過銀行貸款，整體貸款與存款比率在2015年底降至70.1%，較去年同期的72.2%有所下降。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，呼籲加強國際間的合作與溝通，以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局持續積極參與國際及區域論壇，並不遺餘力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，以及善用人民幣國際化，進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港強勁的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現，繼續獲得信貸評級機構的認可，標準普爾亦維持對香港的最高評級AAA。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際有關全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題討論。今年七月，香港金融管理局擔任亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）的共同主席，任期為兩年。該小組的目標是促進金融穩定理事會成員與非成員之間在政策倡議上的互動，鼓勵落實金融改革，並促進有關金融穩定問題的觀點交流。香港金融管理局繼續與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局密切合作，加強亞洲東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作，該辦公室已升格為國際組織，負責監測和分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策過程。\n\n在本年度內，由於多項市場因素，香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行出現一定程度的收縮。然而，市場仍維持有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易量持續穩定增長。此外，透過香港進行的人民幣業務不斷擴展，亦有助國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）認可人民幣為自由使用的貨幣。IMF決定將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將進一步推動人民幣國際化，以及香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全高效運作及其持續發展，對強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢具有重要意義。香港人民幣支付系統的交易額在2015年創下新高，同時，場外（OTC）衍生工具交易倉儲機構亦持續支持實體按照7月推出的新型場外衍生工具市場監管制度的要求，報告其場外衍生工具交易。\n\n香港金融基礎設施於2015年進一步得到香港金融管理局（HKMA）的增強，新增了多項組成部分及服務，包括於12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著現時已有超過150間銀行能夠透過互聯網及流動通訊渠道接收及處理客戶的電子支票。電子帳單展示及支付（EBPP）服務自2013年推出以來，在2015年持續看到商戶參與度的增加。同年7月，中央銀錢市場單位（CMu）在其資金訂單路由服務下推出了一項服務，以支持內地與香港互認基金（MRF）的實施。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦得到改善，因為《支付系統及儲值憑證設施條例》（PSSVFO）於11月開始實施。根據《PSSVFO》，香港金融管理局獲授權推行多用途儲值設施的強制牌照制度，並執行相關監管及執法職能，同時指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全及有效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫日益增強，香港金融管理局（HKMA）積極透過國際及區域論壇，包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），與其他管轄區合作，推動可持續經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦持續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以協助增強全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於七月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）資產管理小組（RCG(A)）的共同主席，並於十月在香港主辦該小組第九次會議。RCG(A) 是一個重要的平台，讓FSB成員與非FSB成員就金融穩定問題進行溝通與合作。來自亞洲16個司法管轄區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高層代表出席會議，討論地區面臨的風險、資產管理活動增加的影響、行為失當風險以及存款保險計劃的經驗。香港金融管理局亦於八月共同主持了一場有關香港宏觀審慎政策的研討會。該研討會由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）舉辦，並有來自全球18個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了各自在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點討論了工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。香港金融管理局亦與英國央行及國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）共同舉辦了一場會議，探討央行及其他政策制定者在選擇貨幣政策、宏觀審慎政策及微觀審慎政策最佳組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了逾百名參與者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 促進亞洲貨幣與金融穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續致力於區域合作計劃，以促進亞洲金融穩定，並發揮地區在國際金融事務中的集體聲音。作為東亞及太平洋中央銀行理事會（EMEAP）下設貨幣與金融穩定委員會的宏觀監測工作協調機構，香港金融管理局持續準備該委員會的半年度《宏觀監測報告》，以評估地區風險與脆弱性及其政策含義。作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組的主席，香港金融管理局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監管、標準與最佳實務，以及國內和跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗交流與資訊共享。同時，香港金融管理局亦領導該工作小組的跨境合作與發展子小組。香港金融管理局於六月在香港主辦了EMEAP\/BIS外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）的會議。會議由來自地區及主要經濟體的17個當局代表參與，審視金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革進展。\n\n在香港與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局去年簽署AMRO協議後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在增強版區域財政合作機制（CMIM）中的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信貸評級\n\n香港金融管理局持續與國際信用評級機構保持密切對話，以全面評估香港的經濟表現和財政實力。這些努力促成了2015年所有主要信用評級機構對香港信用評級的肯定。標準普爾維持對香港最高的AAA評級，反映該機構認可香港作為高收入經濟體擁有優於平均水平的增長前景、龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現以及強勁的淨外資產地位。穆迪投資服務機構和惠譽評級機構亦分別將香港的評級維持在Aa1和AA+，僅次於三A級一級。\n\n# 香港作為離岸人民幣業務中心的發展\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港人民幣資金池產生了影響。截至年底，人民幣客戶存款和存証券餘額為1,010億元，較去年同期的1,158億元有所下降（圖1）。在境內市場利率下降的背景下，離岸人民幣債券發行有所放緩，結果香港的人民幣債券發行量下降至75億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易額則增長9%，達到6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款餘額也同比增長58%，達到297億元（圖2）。人民幣實時全額清算（RTGS）系統的日均交易額增加至947億元，較2014年增長29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步擴大，根據調查結果顯示，2015年4月底每日交易額約為930億美元，較2013年4月上次BIS三年一度調查時增長了88%。香港仍然是規模最大、深度和廣度俱備的離岸人民幣業務中心。另一項強化這一地位的重要發展是2015年7月推出的MRF計劃，該計劃擴展了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）擴展人民幣跨境資金流動渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界合作提升香港人民幣金融平台的努力，持續取得成果。六月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣業務清算銀行及參與銀行將被允許在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得資金匯往境外，以便利銀行在離岸市場進行人民幣流動性管理。九月，中國人民銀行放寬了跨境人民幣現金池的規定，使更多跨國企業可在簡化安排下進行集團內現金轉移。七月，內地當局亦給予外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金更廣泛的准入權，使其可參與境內銀行間債券市場。九月，內地進一步向這些機構開放了外匯市場。\n\n11月30日，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）宣布決定，自2016年10月1日起將人民幣納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子。此決定肯定了人民幣作為自由使用的貨幣地位，並進一步增強國際社會對使用人民幣進行全球交易的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化以及內地與全球經濟金融體系更緊密聯繫所帶來的新業務機會中受益。\n\n香港全年持續加強與其他管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同舉辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣業務論壇，並第二次與馬來西亞及泰國合作，促進民間部門就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些措施，香港銀行加強了與其他市場在人民幣業務方面的流動性及聯繫，這將為香港帶來更多的人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強市場推廣工作，透過參與在香港及海外市場包括加拿大、日本和非洲等地的行業活動，推動企業和機構更廣泛地使用人民幣進行貿易、投資和融資。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁葉國華於2015年12月11日在香港與倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間的一個研討會上發言。\n\n# CEPA\n\n中國內地與香港於11月在《更緊密經貿合作安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署了一項新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年廣東試點自由化措施中的大部分擴展至全國範圍。新協議原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，預計將為這些銀行在內地經營業務提供更多政策確定性和更大靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續為中國人民銀行（PBoC）、國家外匯管理局及中國銀保監會的官員提供培訓課程。除了涉及中央銀行業務及一般風險管理的課程外，內容還包括消費者保護、信貸資料、貨幣及擔保品管理、財務健全性指標分析以及系統性風險監測等主題。此外，亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表團舉辦了臨時培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n在該年度內，香港金融管理局安排了八次機構政府債券的招標，總額為204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 備付金管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場來說是動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此艱難的投資環境下，香港儲備基金在2015年的整體投資回報為-0.6%，但與主要市場指數及可比投資基金相比，其虧損相對較輕，這得益於香港金融管理局近年來採取的一系列防禦性措施，增強了儲備基金的韌性。\n\n# 契約基金\n\n根據《儲備基金條例》，儲備基金的主要宗旨是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯兌價值。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以協助保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。儲備基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢儲備基金顧問委員會（EFAC）後，可投資於財政司司長認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 交易所基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\n香港儲備基金管理局已為儲備基金訂立以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 為了保本；  \n(b) 為了確保貨幣基礎始終完全由高流動性的美元資產作為後盾；  \n(c) 為了確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣和金融穩定；  \n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以幫助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的組合結構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n廣義而言，儲備基金擁有兩個主要投資組合——擔保組合及投資組合。擔保組合持有高流動性的美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分擔保。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以維持資產價值及長期購買力。兩個組合整體的長期目標債券與股票配置比例為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，資產中有81%分配予美元及港幣，其餘19%則分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直以謹慎和漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資分散至更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外物業投資。新興市場及內地債券和股票屬於投資組合，而私募股權及房地產投資則屬於長期增長組合（LTGP）。LTGP下HKMA投資的淨資產價值上限維持在外匯基金累積結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，長期增長組合下的投資市場價值總計為1421億港元，其中私募股權為913億港元，房地產為508億港元，未償還的投資承諾總額為1224億港元。\n\n為持有香港交易及結算所有限公司股份而於2007年設立的戰略投資組合，該股份係政府為交易所基金的戰略目的而購入，由於該投資組合的特殊性，因此未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券投資基金的投資過程基於兩種資產配置決策——戰略資產配置與戰術資產配置。戰略資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表證券投資基金根據其投資目標所確定的長期最佳資產配置。在戰略配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術配置，以試圖在基準之上取得超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與基準（即戰略）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異被稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準及戰術偏離的限制是由財政司長與證券投資基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）磋商後決定，但戰術決策則由香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據授權作出。在戰術偏離所允許的範圍內，組合經理可以根據短期市場走勢進行投資操作。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部的職員直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，其中包括全部的擔保投資組合及部分投資組合。這部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及實施為基金進行宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生工具輔助投資組合。\n\n# 外部經理的使用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局還聘請位於多個國際金融中心的外部基金管理機構，管理約24%的儲備基金資產，包括其全部上市股票組合及其他專業資產。聘請外部管理機構的目的是利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，採用多樣化的投資風格，並把市場上的知識和資訊傳授給內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人有關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本以及扣繳稅款和其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，每年可能有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。無論是內部還是外部管理的投資組合，均已建立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監督對指引和法規的遵循情況。風險控制工具被用來在正常及不利市場條件下評估市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內部及外部管理者的投資技能。\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n# 2015年的金融市場\n\n2015年全球金融市場波動劇烈，其中股市尤為突出，經歷了異常的動盪。主要股市在年中時段創下新高。然而，由於對中國內地經濟增長的擔憂，市場情緒在第三季度急劇惡化，主要股市不僅抹去了年初至今的漲幅，更出現了顯著的季度虧損。隨後，隨著市場情緒的改善，全球股市有所復甦，但到了年底又再度惡化。由於與中國內地經濟密切相關，香港股市在2015年的表現較其他主要股市更為疲弱。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國利率正常化以及美國利率上行週期的開始，2015年美國長期國債收益率仍僅小幅上升，原因是全球經濟增長的擔憂、持續的全球通縮壓力以及加劇的地緣政治緊張局勢抑制了樂觀情緒。另一方面，由於歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策，歐洲短期政府債券收益率下跌，其中一些甚至跌入負值區域。\n\n在貨幣市場上，2015年美元持續走強，美元指數上漲近10%，這是在市場預期美國開始實施貨幣政策正常化之下的結果。歐元在第一季度大幅貶值，創下自1999年歐元啟用以來最大的單季跌幅，這是在歐洲央行於1月宣布量化寬鬆措施後出現的。另一方面，日元在2015年對美元基本持平。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n# 储備基金的表現\n\n在金融市場異常波動及投資環境艱難的背景下，儲備基金於2015年錄得投資虧損158億港元，其中包括海外股票盈利71億港元、香港股票虧損50億港元、債券盈利159億港元、非港元資產因貨幣翻譯效果產生負數449億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資盈利111億港元。去年美元大幅升值，導致儲備基金非美元資產在轉換為港元時出現不可避免的負數貨幣翻譯效果。另外，戰略組合則錄得估值盈利22億港元。\n\n截至2015年底，儲備基金的總資產達到3,4229億港元。2015年儲備基金（不包括戰略組合）的投資回報率為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現欠佳的主要市場指數及一般投資基金界相比，儲備基金的虧損可謂相對輕微。預見投資環境惡化，金管局近年已採取一系列防禦措施，包括縮短債券組合的期限、增加現金持有量，以及大幅減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化進程，特別是透過長期增長計劃（LTGP）進行的投資。這些措施增強了儲備基金的韌性，並有助緩衝潛在虧損。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年回報率詳見圖表1。表2顯示了2015年的投資回報率，以及基金在不同時間範圍內的平均投資回報率。過去三年的平均回報率為1.2%，過去五年為1.8%，過去十年為3.3%，自1994年以來則為5.0%。表3顯示了2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n圖表1 1994年至2015年儲備基金的投資回報  \n1. 投資回報計算不包括戰略組合的持倉。  \n2. 綜合消費者物價指數是根據2009\/2010年為基準的系列計算的。\n"}

Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 企業功能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及其他各種渠道，與社區及市場保持有效溝通，以促進對其政策和運作的了解。2015年，香港金融管理局通過支持員工專業發展、建立嚴謹的財務紀律、提升資訊科技安全，以及重新分配高層管理人員的職責，來改善公司治理，以應對新計劃和系統實施所帶來的挑戰，以及工作日益複雜化的情況。\n\n# 呼應社區 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金融管理局與新聞媒體密切合作，以提高透明度並促進公眾對其政策和工作的理解。2015年共舉辦了59場公開媒體活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14場站立採訪及31場其他公開活動。此外，還安排了43場媒體專訪，發佈了325份雙語新聞稿，並每天處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為提高公眾對香港金融管理局（HKMA）主要職能的認識，分別組織了兩次媒體參觀活動，分別前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行間清算有限公司（HKICL），以展示香港世界一流的紙幣印刷技術和金融基礎設施。同時舉辦了有關貨幣局制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的教育研討會，為媒體提供更深入的簡報，介紹這些重要主題。\n\n香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖（中）、副總裁（貨幣管理）李惠來（右）在媒體參觀香港印鈔有限公司期間檢查紙幣的保安特徵。\n\n在香港國際清潔能源有限公司（HKICL）媒體參觀期間進行的自動化支票分類示範。照片中間（從左到右）為香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMA）首席執行官陳德霖先生；財務基礎設施執行總監李志強先生；以及香港國際清潔能源有限公司首席執行官唐慧珊女士。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供了一個有效途徑，以從香港金融管理局（HKMA）獲取資訊，使他們能更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務在2015年處理了9,078宗查詢。其中約一半涉及銀行政策與法規、紙幣與硬幣，以及消費者銀行業務。值得注意的例子包括樓宇按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收集計劃等。\n\n圖表1顯示自2012年以來接獲的公眾查詢數目，而圖表2則列出2015年查詢類別的詳細資料。\n\n圖表1 公眾查詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除香港金融管理局（HKMA）年度報告外，香港金融管理局在過去一年內還發表了兩期半年度貨幣與金融穩定報告、四期季度通訊，並定期更新月度統計通訊，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟問題的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局的高層管理人員還發表了14篇inSight文章，涵蓋各種具體及時的政策議題。\n\n香港金融管理局2014年度報告在香港管理協會2015年度最佳年報頒獎禮的「非牟利機構及慈善組織」類別中獲得了銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）的公司網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）擁有超過50,000頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口網站。網站亦載有根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的「授權機構（Authorized Institutions，簡稱AIs）證券人員登記冊」及「AIs及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值憑證設施條例》的實施，網站亦會載有根據該條例所設的「儲值憑證發牌機構登記冊」。網站設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，以引起公眾對重要及及時資訊的注意，例如提醒市民提高警惕，防止詐騙電話，以及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣推車的位置等資訊。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 公眾教育計劃\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社區介紹香港金融管理局工作，並提高公眾對貨幣銀行事務認識的重要資源。資訊中心包括展覽區及圖書館，並於每週六天向公眾開放。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作，以及香港貨幣銀行的發展歷程，內設有可供研究香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料和展品。\n\n資訊中心為遊客安排導覽團。在這一年中，中心接待了超過48,300名遊客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導覽活動（圖表3）。自2003年12月開幕以來，已有超過530,400人參觀過資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區旁，收藏超過23,000冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供深入研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行相關主題。根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，圖書館亦維護香港自動櫃員機（ATM）的電子登記冊。\n\n在香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續推動社區接觸的計劃中，該機構繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。2015年，共舉辦了三場講座，約有2,300名中學生及教師參與。講座主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智慧使用以及存款保障計劃。自1998年該計劃啟動以來，已有超過54,700人參與。\n\n圖表3 走訪資訊中心的群組類型\n\n年輕訪客在資訊中心的導覽行程中，學習香港貨幣與銀行業的發展歷程。\n\n中學生和老師參加了一場公眾教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）招募、培訓及維持一支高專業素質的員工隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對不斷變化的重點工作。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的重要組成部分，但它可以根據與公務員制度不同的條件聘用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗和專長的人才。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力維持精簡而靈活的架構，並重新調配人力資源，以推動新計劃及應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變更\n\n在《支付系统及储值设施条例》实施后，货币管理专员办事处（HKMA）於2015年12月在货币管理部（MMD）下成立了新的零售支付监督科，以履行HKMA在储值设施及其他零售支付系统的发牌及日常监管方面的法定职责。为加强部门之间的协同效应，并重新调配人力资源以应对新措施实施所带来的挑战，以及日益增加的工作量和工作复杂性，HKMA於2015年计划在2016年初进行若干部门职责的重新分配。详情如下：\n\n財務基建部（FID）從執法部（ENFD）及貨幣科（MMD）接管了存款保障計劃的管理及結算功能，亦從銀行部門接管了與銀行相關的工作，包括消費者教育、董事發展及加強銀行從業員的能力建構框架；\n\n外事部接替了MMD的市場發展職能，而後者將繼續從事與財政市場協會及財務指標相關的工作；\n\nENFD 從銀行監督處接管了反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險處，並更名為執法與反洗錢處。\n\n# 企業功能\n\n# 人員編制\n\n2015年香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMA）的編制為841人。為確保有足夠資源應對（i）新法例及措施的實施，（ii）持續進行已被證實必要的試驗計劃，以及（iii）現有工作的複雜性及工作量不斷增加，2016年編制增加34人，增至875人（增加4%）。新增職位分派至以下職能：\n\n提升銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試過程的現場檢查、國際銀行標準的實施以及同業評審活動。\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監督；\n\n落實根據新實施的場外衍生品報告及記錄保存規則，針對透過銀行及獲批准的經紀商進行的場外衍生品（OTC）所建立的監督框架；\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法工作；\n\n為實施《金融機構（解決）條例》進行規劃和準備工作，該條例應用國際標準來應對金融業的「大而不倒」問題；\n\n透過為銀行獨立非執行董事開發董事授權計劃，來促進銀行業的能力建設，進一步改善銀行治理，並與產業界合作，推動銀行從業人員在銀行運營核心領域的專業能力框架提升。\n\n提升新銀行、證券及保險產品的銀行行為政策與研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；以及\n\n加強對境內人民幣市場及CNH市場發展情況的監測與分析，以支持香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對與未來基金設立及交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化相關的擴展投資活動的投資、風險管理及法律支持，並在日益艱難的投資環境下，提升戰略資產配置及投資流程。\n\n實施新的法定制度，根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》，賦權香港金融管理局監管儲值設施及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業功能\n\n臨時資源會根據其他工作需求進行調配。香港金融管理局（HKMA）會將借調人員調派至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及財務服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或香港金融管理局有興趣的活動或政策倡議。部分員工則以全職或兼職形式調派，為香港存款保障局及財政市場協會提供運作支援。\n\n# 紅利政策與薪資審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）在匯率基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）下轄的管治小組委員會（GSC）建議下，根據現行市場水平和慣例，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）職員的薪酬及服務條件。薪酬包括總現金報酬包及強制性公積金計劃，實物福利極少。現金報酬包包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及變動薪金，後者視乎個人表現，每年可一次性以現金發放給個別職員。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬由財政司（FS）每年根據財務委員會（EFAC）透過常任秘書處（GSC）提出的建議進行審閱，審閱時會考慮GSC對HKMA上一年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問機構進行的金融界薪酬調查結果，以及其他相關因素。為保持優秀員工的薪酬競爭力，偶爾可能會針對個別表現卓越的員工作出特別調整。\n\n任何經批准的固定薪酬年度調整或任何變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工的表現分配給香港金融管理局（HKMA）的個別員工。HKMA的投資專業人員受變動薪酬制度約束，該制度旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。對於處於總裁或以上職級的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，須由財務匯報局（FS）根據總監理委員會（GSC）的建議批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬時不會出席會議。至於處於部門主管或以下職級的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，則由香港金融管理局首席執行官根據財務匯報局授予的權力，在經批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 基金會\n\n審計主任報告  \n儲備基金財務報表\n\n# 審計主任報告書\n\n# 審計署  \n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n我證明我已審計載於第134至222頁的香港交易所基金及其附屬公司（「該集團」）的財務報表，該財務報表包括香港交易所基金及該集團截至2015年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支賬戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表、現金流量表，以及重要會計政策摘要和其他說明資料。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n\n貨幣當局須根據行政長官根據《儲備基金條例》（第66章）第7條頒發的指示，以及香港財務報告準則，編製真實及公允地反映財務狀況的財務報表，並建立貨幣當局認為對編製無重大錯報（不論是因欺詐或錯誤所致）財務報表而言屬必要的內部控制機制。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計結果，對這些財務報表發表意見。我進行審計時，遵守了根據《庫務條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準。這些標準要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃和執行審計工作，以取得合理保證，確保財務報表沒有重大錯報。\n\n審計包括執行程序以取得財務報表中金額和披露事項的審計證據。所選用的程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括對財務報表存在重大錯報風險的評估，無論該風險是源自舞弊或錯誤。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製提供真實及公允觀點的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計適合當時情況的審計程序，但並非用於對實體內部控制的有效性發表意見。審計亦包括評估財政機構所採用的會計政策的適當性及所作出的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表整體的呈報方式。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據已經足夠且恰當，足以作為我提出審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計長報告書（續）\n\n# 評論\n\n依我之見，截至2015年12月31日止，香港儲備基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，在財務報表中均真實及公正地反映，且根據香港財務報告準則編製，並按照財政司司長根據《儲備基金條例》第7條頒佈的指示正確編製。\n\n孫大衛  \n審計總監\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會  \n26樓  \n入境事務大樓  \n7號 Gloucester 道  \n香港灣仔區\n\n# 目錄\n\n收支帳戶  \n綜合收益表  \n資產負債表  \n股東權益變動表  \n現金流量表  \n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務活動  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變更  \n4. 收入與支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產與金融負債類別  \n7. 現金及約當現金  \n8. 存放銀行及其他金融機構款項  \n9. 指定按公允價值計量的金融資產  \n10. 可供出售證券  \n11. 衍生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期日證券  \n13. 貸款組合  \n14. 黃金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 子公司權益  \n17. 聯營公司及合營企業權益  \n18. 投資性不動產  \n19. 房產、廠房及設備  \n20. 債券、政府發行流通紙幣及硬幣  \n21. 銀行系統餘額  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構存放款項  \n23. 財政儲備存放款項  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存放款項  \n25. 發行的財政儲備債券及票據  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 其他發行債務證券  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股東權益  \n30. 現金流量表中現金及現金等價物分析  \n31. 業務分部資訊  \n32. 質押資產  \n33. 承諾事項  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重大關聯方交易  \n36. 金融風險管理  \n37. 金融工具公允價值計量  \n38. 財務報表日後非調整事項  \n39. 2015年12月31日止年度尚未生效之修訂、新準則及解釋可能影響  \n40. 財務報表的批准\n\n# 储備基金 – 收入及支出賬戶\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 基金會 – 綜合收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 储備基金 – 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n陳諾文  \n貨幣當局  \n2016年4月7日\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 储備基金 – 所有者權益變動表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 储備基金 – 現金流量表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n# 储備基金 – 現金流量表（續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140至222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 储備基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港元表示。）\n\n# 1 主要業務活動\n\n貨幣管理局根據財政司司長作為外匯基金（基金）管理人的授權，根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的規定管理基金。基金的主要活動是維護香港貨幣的匯兌價值，以及保持香港貨幣和金融體系的穩定與完整。\n\n基金的資產分為四個組合進行管理：擔保組合、投資組合、長期增長組合及戰略組合。根據香港貨幣局制度，擔保組合的資產完全與貨幣基礎相匹配。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券市場和股票市場。長期增長組合持有私募股權及房地產投資。戰略組合則持有香港特別行政區政府（HKSAR）為基金戰略目的而購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份。營運部門的資訊載於附註31。\n\n# 2. 重要會計政策\n\n# 2.1 合規聲明\n\n這些財務報表係按照所有適用之香港財務報告準則（HKFRSs）編製而成，香港財務報告準則係一項總稱，包括所有適用之個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則（HKASs）及香港資深會計師公會（HKICPA）所頒佈之解釋。此外，亦包括在香港一般被接受之會計原則。以下為基金及其附屬公司（合稱為「集團」）採用之重要會計政策摘要。\n\n香港會計師公會已頒佈若干新的及修訂的香港財務報告準則，這些準則首次生效或可供在本期會計期間提前採用。附註3載列了因採納這些發展而導致會計政策變更的資料（如有），並就這些變更對本期及往期會計期間所反映的集團財務狀況的相關性作出說明。\n\n# 储備基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港元表示。）\n\n# 2.2 準備財務報表的基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團本身的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司和合營企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合營企業的主要業務載於附註16及17。\n\n編製財務報表所採用的計量基礎為歷史成本，惟下列資產及負債係按其公允價值列示，詳情請參閱下文所述之會計政策：\n\n交易金融工具（註釋2.6.2.1）；  \n按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（註釋2.6.2.2）；可供出售證券（註釋2.6.2.5）；  \n黃金（註釋2.11）；以及  \n投資性不動產（註釋2.12）。\n\n按照香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計和假設，這些判斷、估計和假設會影響政策的應用以及資產、負債、收入和開支的報告金額。這些估計和相關假設是基於經驗以及在當時情況下認為合理的各種其他因素，其結果構成了對資產和負債攜帶價值作出判斷的基礎，而這些價值從其他來源並不容易明顯看出。實際結果可能與這些估計有所不同。\n\n估計數字及其相關假設會持續進行審查。若估計數字的修改僅影響當期，則在當期確認該修改；若修改同時影響當期及未來期間，則在修改當期及未來期間確認該修改。\n\n附註18載有與投資性房地產公允價值估算相關的假設資訊。附註37載有與金融工具公允價值估算相關的假設資訊。除附註2.5所述某些金融工具的估值外，集團會計政策的應用中沒有涉及關鍵會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3 子公司及非控制權益\n\n子公司是指由集團所控制的實體。當集團對某實體擁有控制權時，即表示集團因參與該實體而暴露於或擁有來自該實體的變動報酬，且集團能透過對該實體的權力來影響這些報酬。在評估集團是否擁有控制權時，僅考慮實質權利（由集團及其他各方所持有）。\n\n# 储備基金 – 財務報表附註（續）\n\n（除非另有說明，所有金額均以百萬港元表示。）\n\n自控制開始之日到控制結束之日，對子公司的投資將合併至集團財務報表中。\n\n在編製集團財務報表時，集團內部往來餘額、交易及現金流量，以及由此產生的未實現利潤及虧損將全部予以抵銷。\n\n非控制權益是指子公司中不直接或間接歸屬於基金的股權，且集團與該等權益持有人之間未另行達成任何條款，導致集團整體對該等權益負有符合財務負債定義的契約義務。非控制權益在集團資產負債表中列示於權益項目內，與歸屬於基金所有者的權益分開列示。集團的業績中屬於非控制權益的部分，會在集團損益表及綜合收益表中明確列示，作為將當年盈虧及總綜合收益或虧損在非控制權益與基金所有者之間進行分配的項目。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資按成本減去減值損失（如有）列示（註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 合夥人與合資企業\n\n聯營公司是指集團能夠參與其財務及營運政策決策，因而對其管理具有重大影響力，但並未達到控制或共同控制程度的實體。\n"}
