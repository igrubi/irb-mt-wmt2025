{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","zh":"2019年一點都不平淡無奇。\n\n中美貿易緊張局勢仍是個巨大的變數。全球兩大經濟體之間的貿易談判仍存在持續不確定性，這擾亂了投資者的信心，也削弱了國際貿易、製造業、投資甚至消費。過去全球經濟擴張被視為理所當然的時代已經一去不復返。在這一年中，全球經濟進入了同步減速的階段。面對較慢的增長，世界各地的主要央行已轉變立場，放棄了貨幣政策正常化的路線。\n\n在香港本地，今年下半年發生的社會事件進一步打擊了香港經濟。零售、旅遊及餐飲業是受影響最嚴重的行業。2019年全年，香港經濟收縮1.2%，為十年來首度出現年度經濟下滑，同時失業率由年初的多年低點2.8%上升至3.3%。踏入2020年，新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19）爆發，又對全球及本地經濟構成另一重大威脅。\n\n面對如此不確定且具有挑戰性的環境，維持香港的貨幣和金融穩定至關重要，我在2019年10月1日接任香港金融管理局總裁時已明確指出這一點。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自1983年實施聯繫匯率制度（LERS）以來，香港已成功應對多次挑戰與衝擊，充分體現了該制度作為香港經濟繁榮基石及國際金融中心地位的重要作用。儘管當年面對艱難的內外環境，聯繫匯率制度仍順利有序運作，再次證明其在不確定時期的韌性。香港銀行體系亦保持穩健。事實說明一切：港元匯率持續穩定，並在最近幾個月強勢位於貨幣發行局的兌換區間強方，同時銀行存款在當年繼續增長。總而言之，並未觀察到港元或銀行體系出現明顯資金外流的情況。\n\n香港的貨幣和銀行體系的穩定性，不僅反映出我們體系的穩健，也反映出外界對我們體系的強烈信心。這並非一朝一夕之功，而是經過多年的努力，建立緩衝機制、加強監測，並配合我們對社交媒體平台上謠言的迅速回應，才得以實現的。\n\n多年來我們為不測之際所做的準備，為香港的貨幣和銀行體系奠定了堅實的基礎，並建立了強大的緩衝機制。除了我們公共財政中龐大的外匯儲備，我們的銀行體系亦擁有強勁的資本緩衝、穩健的流動性以及非常優良的資產質素，無論以國際標準或歷史標準來衡量皆屬上乘。自2009年起實施的八輪反週期宏觀審慎措施，針對樓宇按揭方面，亦大大增強了銀行對樓市下行風險的應對能力。\n\n市場監測與銀行監管構成了我們維持貨幣和銀行體系穩定工作的核心部分，我們一直在不斷加強監測與監管框架。除了密切監控銀行的信貸和流動性風險外，今年我們的新舉措之一是利用從銀行收集的技術和細緻數據，以更深入和及時的方式提升我們監測港元融資及金融市場活動的能力。同時，我們亦根據快速演變的經濟和營運環境，加強了壓力測試和應急計劃。\n\n事實上，我們強大的監管體制已獲得國際社會的強烈肯定。在今年內，國際貨幣基金組織重申，香港擁有充足的緩衝措施，因此具備應對週期性和結構性變化的良好條件。香港在打擊洗錢和恐怖主義融資方面的有效法律和制度框架，亦獲得金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的正面評價，使香港成為亞太地區第一個在FATF相互評估中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基礎，對維護貨幣和金融穩定至關重要。為維護市場信心，我們必須高度警覺，並迅速應對任何可能對香港貨幣或銀行體系造成懷疑的惡意謠言。這在當今社交媒體和即時通訊廣泛使用的背景下尤為重要。在社會動蕩爆發期間，一些散播恐慌的人士在社交媒體平台上散佈各種謠言，我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速而清晰地駁斥這些謠言，證明對澄清事實、遏制謠言進一步擴散，以及維護國際和公眾對我們體系的信心具有實效。\n\n# 銀行體系：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n銀行業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，在確保社會與經濟順利運作方面發揮著根本性的作用。儘管自今年下半年以來營運環境充滿挑戰，銀行仍與各界共同努力，竭盡所能維持核心業務的正常運作，並持續為企業和公眾提供服務。\n\n除了存款和轉帳等基本銀行服務外，銀行的重要功能在於向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們清楚認識到，並關注在艱難經濟環境下企業，特別是中小企業（SMEs）所面臨的現金流問題。在維護銀行體系穩定的同時，我們已推出多項措施，以確保持續向中小企業提供資金支持。特別是，銀行的逆週期資本緩衝比率在2019年10月及2020年3月兩次調低，總共降低150個基點至1.0%；2020年4月，銀行的法定準備金率也減半。這些措施釋放約1萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行提供更多貸款空間，以支持包括中小企業在內的企業。我們亦設立了一個平台——銀行界中小企業貸款協調機制，將香港的主要銀行集合起來，探討具體措施以加強對中小企業的資金支持。我很高興看到許多銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，為有需要的客戶推出減免本金等緩衝措施，幫助他們渡過難關。\n\n鑑於一些中小企業反映開設銀行帳戶存在困難，而開設銀行帳戶正是接觸各種銀行服務的第一步，我們在過去幾年來一直致力解決這個問題。我們的工作已見成效，企業開戶情況已有所改善。為進一步推動金融包容，香港金融管理局率先推出分層帳戶服務——簡化客戶盡職審查程序的簡易銀行帳戶（SBAs），為初創企業和中小企業提供傳統銀行帳戶以外的替代選擇。截至目前為止，已開設超過2,800個簡易銀行帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上\n\n我們始終意識到在監管與發展之間取得合理平衡的重要性。鑑於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其長期穩定。重點工作有四個方面：科技、綠色金融、與內地的金融聯繫，以及人才發展。\n\n# 在數位時代擁抱科技\n\n自2016年香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室成立及2017年推出智慧銀行計劃以來，香港在推動金融科技（FinTech）方面進展迅速。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的活躍程度體現在快速支付系統（FPS）採用的強勁動能，FPS 是全球首個支持多種貨幣、跨銀行及電子錢包的即時零售支付平台。FPS 的註冊用戶數在短短15個月內已達四百萬，這在七百五十萬人口中顯示出很高的滲透率。政府亦採用FPS，為公眾提供繳稅、地稅及水費等費用時更大的便利。預計越來越多企業將使用這種快速、安全且便捷的支付方式來提高營運效率。\n\n在香港銀行業，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務運作方面已取得顯著進展。根據香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行的一項研究，約有90%受訪的零售銀行已採用或正計劃採用人工智慧於其業務應用中。在HKMA的推動下，銀行已將大數據及消費者行為分析應用於其個人信貸產品中。此外，銀行已在第一及第二階段推出了逾800個開放式應用程式介面（API），涵蓋多種銀行產品及服務。在鼓勵銀行應用金融科技的同時，我們亦沒有忽略數碼銀行服務中加強技術風險管理及消費者保護的需要。我們已及時向銀行提供相關範疇的監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行界極具興趣的另一個領域，因其有潛力讓銀行更高效且更具成本效益地進行合規管理和風險管理，特別是在反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界更廣泛採用Regtech，並建立更完善的Regtech生態系統，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於11月舉辦了首屆AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發行了首份Regtech通訊，以探討Regtech的潛在應用案例。同時，作為銀行監管機構，HKMA亦正在探索應用監管科技（Suptech），包括新興的數據科學與分析技術，以提升工作成效與效率。我們已展開一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年Suptech實施的路線圖。\n\n從更廣泛的角度來看，這只是銀行業金融科技旅程的開始。香港金融管理局（HKMA）在今年內向虛擬銀行授予了八項牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行已于2020年3月正式推出服務，而其他一些虛擬銀行則通過香港金融管理局的金融科技監管沙盒開始進行試點測試。我期待其他虛擬銀行的推出，以及更多創新和多元化的銀行服務在香港居民中推出，這將有助於提升我們銀行業的全球競爭力。\n\n國際層面也預期將有更多令人興奮的發展。在成功完成將我們基於區塊鏈的貿易融資平台eTradeConnect與歐洲對應平台連接的概念驗證（PoC）試驗後，我們目前正在與中國人民銀行的平台進行另一項PoC試驗，為跨境貿易的數字化鋪平道路。我們已與泰國銀行開始了一項聯合研究項目，研究央行數字貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際清算銀行（BIS）也於11月在香港啟用了其第一個創新中心，以促進央行之間的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地證明了香港在全球金融科技發展中的領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色永續金融，創造更美好未來\n\n近年來，與氣候相關的風險日益受到全球關注。為貢獻全球應對這一挑戰的努力，香港金融管理局於五月份推出了三項關鍵措施，從不同方面推動香港綠色金融的發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局（HKMA）正採取三階段方法推動綠色和可持續銀行業務。第一階段已制定一套評估銀行「綠色程度」的框架，供業界諮詢，為第二階段擬訂監管期望和要求，以及第三階段的落實奠定基礎。\n\n作為匯換基金的管理機構，香港金融管理局積極推動負責任的投資，將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素納入投資活動中。具體而言，我們在風險調整後的長期回報與其他投資相近的情況下，會優先考慮綠色及ESG投資。自2015年作為早期投資者進入綠色債券市場後，我們將繼續擴大綠色債券組合，並投資於其他ESG資產。我們亦會與志同道合的投資者及監管機構合作，透過參與ESG社群的國際組織，推動ESG的最佳實踐。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","zh":"# 經濟與財政環境\n\n2019年香港經濟出現收縮，反映出全球經濟放緩、美中貿易衝突持續以及本地社會事件的影響。由於年內下半段經濟情況迅速惡化，勞動市場面臨日益增加的壓力。此外，豬肉價格急劇上漲也導致通貨膨脹上升。預計2020年的經濟表現仍將充滿挑戰，因為新型冠狀病毒的爆發將進一步打擊已經疲弱的經濟。鑒於艱難的經濟環境，政府與香港金融管理局已推出措施支持經濟，特別是家庭及中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實體活動\n\n在2018年擴張2.9%之後，香港經濟在2019年收縮了1.2%，這是自2009年以來首次出現年度經濟收縮。特別是，經濟在年中進入衰退，經季節調整後的實際國內生產總值（GDP）在第二、第三和第四季度連續下滑（表1）。經濟活動的下降反映了本地需求顯著減少（圖1）。由於本地社會事件對年內後期的消費活動和消費情緒造成重大影響，私人消費支出出現自2003年以來的首次年度下降。整體投資開支也因企業情緒低迷而下滑。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩，以及中美貿易戰期間加徵的關稅，導致香港貨物出口下降。服務出口也創下歷來最大的年度降幅，因為社會事件導致入境旅遊嚴重惡化。由於本地及轉口需求減少，貨物和服務進口情況也進一步惡化。從淨貿易的角度來看，淨貿易在2019年對GDP有正面貢獻（圖1），因為總進口量下降速度比總出口量更快。\n\n鑑於經濟面臨強勁逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月期間推出多輪措施，以減輕居民的財政負擔、保障就業及支持企業，特別是中小企業（SMEs）以及受衝擊較大的行業，如零售、餐飲、運輸和旅遊業。為讓銀行能更積極支持本地經濟並緩解經濟週期的波動，金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行的逆週期資本緩衝比率由2.5%調降至2.0%，從而為銀行提供更多靈活性，釋放約200至300億港元的銀行信貸，以支持包括中小企業在內的企業，並同時設立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制。此外，中小企業融資擔保計劃（SFGS）的80%擔保產品於9月推出新一項紓困措施，允許因現金流減弱而面臨困難的中小企業借款人申請本金寬限期，以獲得即時支援。進一步地，SFGS於12月推出了一項新的90%貸款擔保產品，為中小企業、經營經驗較少的企業，以及希望開設私人實踐的專業人士提供額外的融資支持。\n\n# 貨幣條件\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作順暢有序。全年來，港元匯率大致穩定。由於在三月觸發了弱方兌換保證機制，香港金融管理局以7.85港元兌1美元的匯率向銀行購入港元，並向銀行出售美元，導致根據聯繫匯率制度的設計，總結餘有所下降。港元銀行間利率在長期端大致保持穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，繼美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下調後，多間零售銀行於十月底將其最佳貸款利率下調12.5個基點。至於貨幣供應總額，2019年銀行總貸款額增加6.7%，較2018年的4.4%有所上升，而全年總存款額則增長2.9%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n剔除政府一次性纾困措施的影响後，核心通脹率由2018年的2.6%輕微上升至2019年的3.0%。通脹的輕微上升主要由自5月以來新鮮豬肉供應中斷所導致的豬肉價格上漲所推動（圖2）。若排除基本食品項目，全年物價壓力整體保持在相對溫和的水平。特別是消費者物價通脹中的住房部分，隨著私人住宅租賃價格較早前出現盤整而有所緩和。更廣泛而言，名義工資的輕微增長以及商業租金的較慢上升，有助於控制本地企業成本。從外部環境看，進口物價通脹有所緩和，這與全球經濟增長放緩導致香港一些主要進口來源地的通脹下降相一致。\n\n# 勞動市場\n\n2019年上半年，勞動市場整體上仍保持韌性，但下半年則面臨日益增加的壓力（圖表3）。在頭兩個季度，經季節調整後的失業率維持在多年來的低點2.8%，但第三季上升至2.9%，第四季則進一步增至3.3%。在社會事件的影響下，與消費和旅遊相關行業的失業率上升尤其明顯。整體勞動需求在年內後期明顯減少，總就業人數和私人部門職位空缺數量均下降。勞動需求的減少在零售、住宿及餐飲服務業，以及進出口貿易和建築業中尤為突出。從供給方面來看，勞動力參與率略有下降，部分原因是對經濟衰退的週期性反應。隨著勞動市場壓力不斷增加，名義工資和收入的增長在年內末期出現放緩跡象。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n2019年本地股市出現劇烈波動。在頭四個月股市上揚後，由於對中美貿易爭端再度升級的擔憂，恆生指數於5月急跌（見圖4）。儘管6月因主要央行發出更為寬鬆的貨幣政策信號而收復部分失地，但隨着全球經濟增長放緩及本地社會事件，股價再度受壓。年內末段，美國與中國大陸宣布達成「第一階段」貿易協議後，股價重拾上升動能。恆生指數全年收報28,190點，全年累計上漲9.1%。相比之下，平均每日成交額較去年同期下降約19%。一家主要內地科技公司及一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，使2019年通過首次公開招股（IPO）籌集的股本資金增至3,142億港元。香港在2019年連續第二年在全球IPO籌資額方面排名第一。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2019年前五個月，住宅物業市場出現強勁反彈，但其餘時間整體表現趨弱。2019年初市場情緒有所改善，部分原因是對中美貿易緊張關係的擔憂暫時緩和，但隨後中美貿易緊張關係再度升級、社會事件延續以及國內經濟狀況惡化，使市場情緒受到打擊。整體樓價從5月至12月間從峰值回落了5%，但由於前五個月樓價反彈了10%，因此全年樓價仍錄得5%的年增長（圖4）。2019年的交易量較去年同期增加4%，達到59,797個單位，反映出年初交易活動較為活躍。房屋負擔能力仍然緊張，價格與收入比率及收入負擔比率分別高達17.9和80.9，遠高於長期平均水平。為協助有迫切住房需求的買家，香港按揭證券有限公司（HKMC）於10月中提高按揭保險計劃中可申請按揭貸款的已完成住宅物業價值上限。另一方面，2019年非住宅物業市場面臨更強的下行壓力。特別是零售物業的價格和租金自2008年全球金融危機以來錄得最大跌幅，反映出當年業務環境惡化。\n\n# 經濟展望\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預計香港2020年的經濟表現將非常具有挑戰性，與新型冠狀病毒疫情相關的近期内下行風險相當顯著。一些尚未從社會事件造成的中斷中恢復的行業，例如零售、住宿、餐飲、旅遊和運輸，將會受到雙重打擊。然而，2020\/21年度預算中宣布的反週期財政措施，包括一次性現金發放，以及在SFGS（特別財政擔保貸款計劃）下提供100%政府擔保的新優惠低息貸款，預計將為經濟提供一定程度的支持，特別是對家庭和中小企業。2020年3月16日，香港金融管理局進一步將銀行的反週期資本緩衝比率從2.0%調降至1.0%，這將使銀行能更積極支持本地經濟，特別是那些因新型冠狀病毒疫情衝擊而預期會面臨額外短期壓力的行業和個人。從GDP組成部分來看，私人消費和投資可能因消費者和企業信心脆弱而持續疲弱。雖然政府消費將對經濟增長有所貢獻，但公共投資支出預計會因一些主要基礎設施項目完成後而相對緩慢。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議在短期內被評估對本地經濟略有正面影響。然而，香港的外貿表現仍將受到全球經濟增長疲弱和貿易流量下滑的拖累。特別是新型冠狀病毒疫情可能導致區域供應鏈中斷，以及跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，進而抑制香港的出口。政府預計2020年實際GDP增長將介於-1.5%至0.5%之間，而國際組織和私人機構分析師的增長預測平均為-3.3%。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞動市場\n\n由於經濟表現欠佳、私人住宅租賃市場趨於穩定以及進口通脹緩和，預計2020年的通脹壓力將有所減緩。市場共識預測2020年的整體通脹率為1.8%，政府則預計整體通脹率和核心通脹率分別為1.7%和2.5%。在勞動市場方面，鑒於經濟前景惡化及新型冠狀病毒的爆發，失業率在短期內可能進一步上升。私人部門分析師預計2020年的失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定性與風險\n\n2020年的經濟展望較為謹慎，受到多項不確定因素和風險的影響，包括全球經濟放緩、中美貿易關係、內地經濟表現、本地社會事件以及新型冠狀病毒疫情的持續。特別是，若新型冠狀病毒疫情持續延長，可能引發更明顯的全球經濟放緩和資產重評，進而導致不利的宏觀經濟環境和更緊縮的金融條件，對本地實體經濟造成進一步的下行壓力。然而，主要央行更為協調一致地放寬貨幣政策，可能緩衝疫情對經濟造成的負面影響。\n\n# 銀行業的表現\n\n儘管2019年面對全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張關係及本地社會事件等艱難環境，香港銀行業仍表現出韌性。銀行資產負債表趨勢穩定，貸款和存款均適度增長。銀行業的資本和流動性狀況依然穩健，資產質量亦保持良好。銀行業繼續保持盈利，平均資產報酬率保持穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n2019年，港元匯率及貨幣市場運作順暢有序。全年港元匯率保持穩定，年內末期更強勢地維持在可兌換區間的強方。作為香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度屢屢展現其應對衝擊的韌性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。貨幣穩定是指香港貨幣在國際外匯市場上對美元的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的波動範圍內。香港的貨幣體系結構以貨幣局制度為特徵，要求貨幣基礎必須至少有100%由外匯基金持有的美元儲備資產作為後盾，並確保貨幣基礎的任何變動都必須由相應的美元儲備資產變動來完全配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n\n債務證書，為三家發鈔銀行所發行的紙幣提供充分擔保。\n\n- 流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣的總餘額，即銀行在金管局開設的清算賬戶餘額總和\n\n- 香港金融管理局代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund Bills and Notes（EFBNs）\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅定履行貨幣發鈔承擔（Convertibility Undertakings，簡稱CUs）的承諾來維持的。當對香港美元的需求高於供應，市場匯率強升至強方貨幣發鈔承擔水平，即每美元兌換7.75港元時，香港金融管理局準備根據銀行的要求，出售港元以換取美元。總餘額隨之擴展，壓低港元利率，創造貨幣條件，使港元匯率從強方限制水平移動至7.75至7.85的貨幣發鈔區間內。相反地，若香港美元的供應高於需求，市場匯率弱跌至弱方貨幣發鈔承擔水平，即每美元兌換7.85港元時，香港金融管理局準備根據銀行的要求，購入港元。總餘額隨之收縮，推高港元利率，使港元匯率從弱方限制水平移動，並保持在7.75至7.85的貨幣發鈔區間內。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 汇率穩定性\n\n儘管外部環境存在不確定性，以及本地經濟增速放緩，2019年港元匯率仍保持穩定，交易順暢有序。年初時，港元與美元的負利率差擴大，吸引投資者進行套利交易，即沽售港元買入美元，推動港元匯率向弱方兌換率7.85靠近（見圖1）。隨著港元匯率持續走弱，3月份弱方兌換率最終被觸發達八次。其後，港元匯率持續接近弱方兌換率7.85。自5月下旬起，由於大型首次公開招股（IPO）活動、企業派息需求及年中結算所引致的強港元需求，港元匯率開始走強。雖然年中後港元匯率一度回落，但自10月下旬起重拾升勢，年底時港元匯率處於兌換區間的強方。這部分反映了與股權相關的需求，包括IPO活動，以及由於年底流動性收緊而導致的沽售港元頭寸的平倉。總體而言，2019年港元匯率市場運作正常。\n\n由於弱方兌換率觸發，總體結餘（貼現窗之前）及未償還的外匯基金債券與紙幣總額，由2018年底的1,1362億港元，下降至2019年底的1,1330億港元（見圖2）。在這一年內，根據聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，香港金融管理局在弱方兌換率7.85的情況下，應銀行要求購入總額221億港元，導致總體結餘（貼現窗之前）由2018年底的764億港元，下降至2019年底的543億港元。未償還的外匯基金債券與紙幣則在這一年內輕微上升，由1,0598億港元增至1,0787億港元，反映根據既定慣例發行外匯基金債券與紙幣以吸收其利息支付。整體貨幣基礎仍完全由外匯儲備支持。2019年底總體結餘（貼現窗之前）及未償還的外匯基金債券與紙幣總額為1,1330億港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在2019年，港元銀行間利率在長期端大致保持穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升（圖3）。短期利率亦因與首次公開招股（IPO）相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需求而出現更多波動。自2018年4月以來總餘額的減少，可能導致港元銀行間利率對本地市場港元資金供需變化的敏感度提高。\n\n基準利率分別於8月1日、9月19日及10月31日調低共75個基點，由2018年底的2.75%降至2019年11月初的2.00%，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年內三次下調共75個基點，由2.25–2.50%降至1.50–1.75%。11月18日至26日及12月19日至31日期間，基準利率均高於2.00%，反映當年最後兩個月的隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBOR）明顯上揚。因此，基準利率於2019年底收於2.49%。基準利率的調整遵循2009年3月26日公佈的修訂公式，該公式規定基準利率為美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限之上50個基點，或隔夜及一個月HIBOR五日移動平均值的平均數，以較高者為準。在零售方面，多間零售銀行於10月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下調後，將其最佳貸款利率降低了12.5個基點。\n\n在香港美元遠期點數的折扣在頭兩個月擴大，大致跟隨香港美元與美元利率差的走勢，至二月中旬，12個月期的香港美元遠期點數達到約-708個點（見圖4）。其後，隨著香港美元與美元利率差的負值逐漸收窄，香港美元遠期點數的折扣也逐漸縮小，並在年底轉為升水。總體而言，香港的貨幣市場運作有序。貼現窗借款額由2018年的402億港元減少至2019年的383億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度（LERS）在過去三十多年來對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出了重大貢獻，並在多次區域及全球金融危機中展現了其韌性。在本年度社會事件的背景下，一些無根據的謠言在社交媒體上流傳，對聯繫匯率制度及香港的金融穩定性提出質疑。香港金融管理局（HKMA）迅速而積極地透過傳統媒體及社交媒體駁斥這些謠言，向公眾重申聯繫匯率制度將會繼續實施，香港亦不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，香港金融管理局亦發表了一系列文章，協助公眾了解聯繫匯率制度的運作、資金流動情況及利率展望。這些努力有效地維持了公眾對聯繫匯率制度的信心，這也反映在全年市場運作有序的表現上。政府亦堅定支持聯繫匯率制度，政府對此制度的承諾，以及港元作為支付手段和價值儲藏工具的地位，亦因外匯市場和貨幣市場的穩定而進一步得到加強。在2019年與香港的第四條協議磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申了其對聯繫匯率制度作為香港金融穩定基石的長期支持，並指出聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港合適的匯率安排，這是以香港透明的規則、充足的財政和外匯儲備、強大的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體系以及謹慎的財政框架為基礎的。\n\n健全的銀行體系對LERS的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系流動性高且穩健，其流動性水平和資本充足率均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直密切監測銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業貸款、與物業相關貸款及與內地相關貸款的監管。與以往幾年相比，銀行的總餘額較為低，整體而言銀行已加強流動性管理安排，並在日常資金安排上更加積極主動。此外，HKMA亦與銀行保持密切對話，以確保市場流動性順暢迴圈，尤其是在大型首次公開招股（IPO）認購期前及期間。當年並未出現結算阻塞的情況，貼現窗口亦持續有效且高效率地運作。\n\n為提高貨幣基金會帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產用以支持貨幣基礎。2019年間，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）介於109.9%至112.1%之間，未觸及上限或下限觸發水平。截至2019年12月31日，該比率為111.2%（見圖表5）。根據聯繫匯率制度，在特定外匯基金資產被指定用於支持組合的情況下，所有外匯基金資產均可用於支持港元匯率。一旦發生突發性衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財務資源，加上香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣與金融穩定提供強大支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港金融管理局諮詢委員會下的貨幣局小組委員會（CBC）負責監測和審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。2019年，CBC考慮了包括對聯繫匯率制度（LERS）運作的事件研究、香港總結餘與利率之間的關係、對選購權市場對LERS看法的改進和更靈活的處理方法，以及未來首次公開招股（IPO）對香港銀行同業拆借利率（HIBOR）的影響等問題。CBC就這些問題的討論記錄，以及提交給CBC的貨幣局運作報告，均會在香港金融管理局網站上發佈。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究機構（HKIMR），前稱香港貨幣研究機構，致力於進行與貨幣政策、銀行及金融相關的政策研究。這一點體現在HKIMR研究人員及海外訪客所探討的廣泛主題，以及其舉辦的研討會和活動中。HKIMR與主要央行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為重點的研討會。其研究訪問計劃支持與香港金融管理局（HKMA）、香港特別行政區及地區重要的政策研究項目。\n\n2019年，香港國際金融研究中心接待了14位研究學者，發表了17篇工作論文，舉辦了11場公開研討會，涵蓋廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。此外，該中心還舉辦了三場國際會議：\n\n第十屆中國經濟國際研討會以「中國金融改革與經濟轉型」為題，於1月10日至11日在香港舉行，由香港國際金融中心研究院（HKIMR）、中國人民銀行金融研究所及國務院發展研究中心金融研究所聯合主辦。該研討會為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界及金融業的經濟專家提供了一個世界一流的論壇，共同探討在金融改革及中國經濟發展所帶來的變化背景下，中國金融部門所面臨的風險問題。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n儘管全球和本地經濟走弱帶來了不利因素，香港銀行業在2019年仍然保持穩健和穩定。由於業界的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件期間繼續正常運作。採取了措施，以將對公眾造成的不便降至最低。在這一年中，香港金融管理局（HKMA）將監管重點放在授權機構的信貸和流動性風險管理上。鑒於網絡威脅日益增加，以及業界對科技的依賴不斷加深，香港金融管理局加強了對授權機構科技風險管理的監管。在行為監管方面，香港金融管理局簡化了投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，同時保障客戶權益。我們亦加強了數字金融服務中的消費者保護，並持續推動以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗钱及反恐融资（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動特別工作組對香港AML\/CFT制度進行第四輪相互評估的完成，整體評估認為香港的制度符合標準且具有效性，特別肯定銀行業對風險的良好理解，以及香港金融管理局（HKMA）在AML\/CFT方面以風險為本的監管工作。香港金融管理局持續參與公私合作的資訊共享機制，以應對詐騙及洗錢活動，並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行業發展方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2019年向八間虛擬銀行頒發銀行牌照，並宣布採取三階段方法，以推動香港綠色和可持續銀行業的發展。香港金融管理局一直與銀行業界密切合作，優化監管政策和程序，並推行能力建設計劃，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，國際監管標準在本地的實施方面取得了實質性進展，包括資本充足率標準、信息披露標準、流動性標準及大額風險敞口標準。香港金融管理局亦持續進行相關工作，以確保授權機構有可信的解決機制，包括實施吸收損失能力要求的規則，以提高授權機構的可解決性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金融管理局的總體目標是促進銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現這一目標有賴於金融體系具備高度的韌性，並能提供香港經濟所需的重要金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其經營方式，甚至在極端情況下以混亂方式倒閉，都可能影響系統的穩定性。作為監管機構，貨幣當局在確保銀行具備應對衝擊的韌性，並能在危機中恢復其地位，進而幫助預防銀行倒閉方面，發揮關鍵作用。貨幣當局負責香港銀行的審慎監管，其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司，這些機構合稱為獲授權機構（Authorized Institutions，簡稱AIs）。貨幣當局亦負責指定及監督某些金融市場基礎設施（Financial Market Infrastructures，簡稱FMIs）。\n\n然而，貨幣當局無法確保，也從未設計香港審慎監管框架來確保零風險的金融體系。相反地，貨幣當局作為解決機構，旨在確保在某家持牌機構變得不可持續時，其破產能夠以有序方式加以處理。為此，香港已建立金融機構的解決機制，根據該機制，貨幣當局是持牌機構的解決機構。為確保香港的解決機制能夠有效運作，制定解決立法和政策標準、進行解決規劃以消除影響持牌機構可解決性的障礙，以及發展貨幣當局解決失敗持牌機構的運作能力，均至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，貨幣當局採用國際協調一致的解決方法。\n\n# 2019年回顧\n\n# 監督活動概述\n\n2019年進行了196次非現場審閱，涵蓋廣泛的議題，包括CAMEL評分評估、公司治理、風險管理及金融科技策略。作為香港金融管理局（HKMA）持續推動更強風險治理的其中一環，與銀行機構董事會或董事會級別委員會舉行了26次會談。此外，香港金融管理局與銀行機構及其外部審計師之間共舉行了32次三方會談。\n\n除了離岸活動外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）還進行定期的現場檢查，並針對評估風險較高的領域進行主題性審查。當年共進行了405次現場檢查和主題性審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些檢查和審查的重點之一。另一個主要重點是科技風險和營運風險管理。香港金融管理局亦增加了針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及巴塞爾資本充足率框架實施情況的現場檢查和主題性審查數目。同時，專門團隊亦對持牌機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行現場檢查和主題性審查。\n\n表1總結了香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2019年的監管活動概況。\n\n# 信貸風險監督\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n2019年銀行貸款額適度增加。總貸款額增長6.7%，較2018年的4.4%為高。如表2所示，用於香港的貸款及用於香港以外的貸款分別增長7.7%及5.8%。\n\n截至2019年底，與內地相關的貸款增加7.4%，達到4,5640億港元（見表3）。\n\nAIs的資產品質仍然健康。零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年底的0.51%微降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來2%的長期歷史平均水準。就整個銀行業而言，分類貸款比率則從0.55%略微上升至0.57%。具體就與內地相關的貸款而言，零售銀行的分類貸款比率從2018年的0.63%上升至2019年的0.79%，按歷史標準來看仍處於低位。就整個銀行業而言，該比率則從一年前的0.55%上升至0.75%。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）加大了監管力度，確保銀行機構（AIs）在經濟環境不確定的情況下，持續採用謹慎的信貸風險管理標準。壓力測試的溶劑性測試得到了加強，涵蓋更全面的風險範圍，並採用更嚴峻的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行機構一般擁有足夠的資本緩衝，以應對極端衝擊。針對不同領域，例如向從事高風險業務的企業貸款、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行和財富管理客戶提供的擔保貸款，進行了針對性和主題性的檢查，以評估銀行機構的信貸風險管理實踐。鑒於中小企業（SMEs）在經濟下行時更可能面臨更大挑戰，香港金融管理局於十月建立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，旨在鼓勵銀行機構在謹慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內，繼續支持中小企業的融資需求。\n\n# 不動產抵押貸款\n\n自2009年以來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）陸續推出了八輪逆週期宏觀審慎措施，顯著增強了香港銀行業抵禦樓市下行風險的韌性。在首次推出逆週期措施前，即2009年9月，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款與樓價比率（LTV）為64%，至2019年12月已降至53%。新按揭貸款的平均償債比率（DSR）亦由2010年8月首次實施DSR上限時的41%，降至2019年12月的36%（圖表1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險監督\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）採用三階段方法來實施「網絡安全強化計劃」（CFI）下的「網絡韌性評估架構」。第一階段的評估涵蓋所有主要銀行，於2018年完成。第二及第三階段所涵蓋的其他機構已按計劃大致完成評估。香港金融管理局亦已開始對CFI進行全面檢討，以根據過去幾年的經驗進一步優化該計劃。\n\n10月，香港金融管理局（HKMA）發佈了修訂版的《監管政策手冊》（SPM）模塊，主題為「電子銀行的風險管理」。此次修訂旨在為業界提供更大的靈活性，以應對電子銀行服務不斷變化的客戶期望。香港金融管理局同時發布了一套關於使用人工智慧的高層原則，以為業界提供指導。\n\n自六月社會事件爆發以來，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直與業界保持密切對話，以監測對銀行營運和服務的影響。銀行被要求更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）的現金，並盡快修復遭破壞的設施。香港金融管理局亦迅速採取行動，駁斥企圖削弱公眾對銀行系統信心的惡意謠言。由於銀行業的共同努力，受影響的銀行分行和設施迅速恢復正常服務，對公眾造成的不便亦降至最低。鑒於社會事件帶來的營運風險不斷上升，銀行被要求採取額外的預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險管理的監督\n\n在本年度內，進行了一輪主題審查，以評估銀行機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。審查重點包括銀行機構流動性壓力測試計劃的穩健性以及應急融資管理。香港金融管理局亦評估銀行機構在計算流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）方面是否符合相關監管要求，以確保計算所用輸入數據的謹慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業日益普及，香港金融管理局（HKMA）進行了一輪主題審查，以評估銀行在這方面的風險管理實踐。鑒於倫敦銀行同業拆借利率（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止發布，香港金融管理局提醒銀行做好轉向替代參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查，以監測它們對過渡的準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及資助恐怖主義（ML\/TF）\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）對持牌機構（AIs）的反洗錢／反恐融资（AML\/CFT）系統進行基於風險的監管。在本年度內，共進行了18次現場檢查及61次非現場審閱，其中包括針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用治理的主題性審閱。香港金融管理局與業界分享了從主題性審閱中得出的觀察結果及最佳實踐，該審閱針對持牌機構在中小企業（SMEs）應用基於風險的AML\/CFT控制措施的情況，以協助持牌機構採用適當的開戶程序及為中小企業提供服務。\n\n# 金融行動特別工作組（FATF）關於香港的相互評估（ME）報告\n\n2019年對香港金融管理局（HKMA）及香港整體的反洗錢／反恐融资（AML\/CFT）制度而言，一個重要亮點是9月發布的金融行動特別工作組（FATF）對香港的互評報告（ME Report）。該報告是FATF對其成員司法管轄區進行第四輪互評以來，至今最優秀的綜合結果之一。在評估香港AML\/CFT制度的有效性時，香港在11項「即時成果」中獲得六項「重大」評級，並在互評的技術合規方面取得高分。\n\n報告書對香港金融管理局（HKMA）在反洗錢／反恐融资（AML\/CFT）監管方面所採用的風險為本方法給予正面評價，指出香港金融管理局對銀行業中的洗錢／恐怖融资（ML\/TF）風險有良好理解，對儲值支付工具（SVF）行業的風險亦有合理理解。報告書亦對銀行業在AML\/CFT方面的集體努力給予正面評價，例如較大型的銀行機構加強使用數據分析技術，大部分可疑交易報告均由銀行機構提交，以及銀行業積極參與打擊詐騙及洗錢情報小組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議在幾個方面進行改進，包括加深對一些高風險領域的認識，例如外國貪污和稅務犯罪，以及發展如SVF等行業。目前已經開始落實這些建議；香港金融管理局（HKMA）於七月發布了有關SVF行業的更新版洗錢及資助恐怖主義（ML\/TF）風險評估，並已開始針對私人銀行業務及新技術應用的治理進行主題式實地檢查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","zh":"# 備付金管理\n\n2019年，全球金融市場表現好過預期，因為主要央行寬鬆的貨幣政策效果蓋過了對全球經濟增長放緩及美中貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。在2018年第四季度出現顯著修正後，全球股市出現反彈，而主要政府債券收益率下跌，債券價格上揚。在這種有利的環境下，香港儲備基金於2019年錄得投資收益2622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 契約基金\n\n根據《儲備基金條例》，儲備基金的主要宗旨是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯兌價值。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與完整，以協助維持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。香港金融管理局根據財政司司長（財政司）授予的權力，並在授權範圍內，就儲備基金的運用及投資管理對財政司司長負責。\n\n# 交易所基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標與組合結構\n\n香港儲備基金管理委員會（EFAC）為香港儲備基金訂立了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 為了保本；  \n(b) 為了確保貨幣基礎始終完全由高流動性的美元資產作為後盾；  \n(c) 為了確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣和金融穩定；  \n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，實現投資回報，以幫助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標充分考慮了基金的法定宗旨，並已納入基金的組合結構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n廣義而言，儲備基金擁有兩個主要投資組合：擔保組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。BP持有高流動性的美元資產，以根據貨幣局制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供充分擔保。IP則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場，以維護其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）以謹慎和漸進的方式，將外匯基金的部分投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別。這包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合（IP）持有，而私募股權和房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。LTGP下投資的市場價值上限設定為外匯基金累積結餘的三分之一，加上與LTGP相關的未來基金及外匯基金子公司投資的總額。\n\n戰略投資組合於2007年成立，持有香港交易及結算所有限公司發行的股份，該股份係政府為交易所基金的戰略目的而購入。由於該組合的特殊性，其並未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 交換基金的投資安排\n\n匯兌基金不時接受財政儲備、政府資金及法定機構的資金存放。利率一般與IP的表現掛鉤，惟未來基金為主要例外，其利率同時與IP及LTGP掛鉤，並根據投資組合比例進行調整。截至2019年底，未來基金在IP與LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n證券投資基金的投資過程基於兩種資產配置決策：戰略資產配置與戰術資產配置。戰略資產配置反映在投資基準中，代表根據證券投資基金的投資目標所進行的長期資產配置。在戰略配置的指導下，資產會進行戰術配置，以試圖實現超越基準的額外報酬。這意味著實際配置通常與基準（或戰略）配置有所不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異被稱為「戰術偏離」。雖然基準和跟蹤誤差限制是由財政司與證券投資基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）磋商後決定，但戰術決策和戰術偏離的允許範圍則是由香港金融管理局（HKMA）根據委派權力作出和設定。在戰術偏離允許的範圍內，組合經理可以採取立場，以利用短期市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局於2018年8月設立外匯基金投資辦公室（EFIO），以統籌其投資及相關風險管理職能。EFIO的員工直接管理外匯基金約71%的投資，包括全部的BP及部分IP。這部分IP包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列投資組合，以及實施為基金進行宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生工具輔助投資組合。\n\n# 外部經理的使用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局（HKMA）還聘請外部基金經理來管理約29%的儲備基金資產，包括其所有上市股票組合及其他專業資產類別。聘請外部經理的目的是利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，發揮多樣化且互補的投資風格，並借助他們在市場洞察力和投資技術方面的專業知識。\n\n與使用外部管理人有關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本以及扣繳稅款和其他稅項。此類支出主要由市場因素決定，每年可能有所波動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，凸顯風險管理的重要性。無論是內部還是外部管理的投資組合，均已建立嚴格的控制措施和投資指引，並密切監督對指引和法規的遵循情況。隨著投資環境變得更加複雜，風險評估亦已加強，以支持匯兌基金投資多元化程度的提高。風險控制工具被用來評估在正常及不利市場條件下的市場風險。同時亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，使金管局能夠評估如何最佳地利用內部及外部管理者的投資能力。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n香港金融管理局支持負責任的投資（RI），透過將環境、社會及治理（ESG）因素納入滙豐基金在公開市場及私營市場投資的投資過程中。\n\n在公共市場投資方面，香港金融管理局（HKMA）實施了過程性及投資性措施。其中一個過程性措施是採納香港證券及期貨事務監理機關於2016年發佈的《負責任擁有原則》（PRO），這些原則協助投資者釐清如何最佳地履行其對香港上市公司投資的擁有責任。在管理外匯基金時，香港金融管理局已制定涵蓋選擇、聘任及監控外部基金管理人的過程的內部指引，以納入環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素。香港金融管理局所聘任的管理香港本地股票及內地主動股票組合的外部基金管理人，須按照「遵守或解釋」的原則，在管理投資時遵守PRO；而管理香港金融管理局開發市場股票組合的外部基金管理人，則須遵守國際公認的ESG標準。除了由外部管理的基金外，ESG因素亦納入香港金融管理局自行管理的債券投資的信貸風險分析中。\n\n至於公開市場的ESG投資，香港金融管理局（HKMA）自2015年起便開始投資綠色債券，是這類市場的早期投資者之一，並參與由國際金融公司（IFC）主辦的「共同貸款管理組合計劃」，該計劃專注於新興市場的可持續投資。展望未來，香港金融管理局將透過直接投資或投資於綠色債券基金的方式，持續擴大其綠色債券組合。此外，香港金融管理局亦計劃在股權投資中構建以ESG為主題的投資指標，方法包括採用ESG股權指數作為被動投資組合的基準，並與主動管理股權經理合作，這些經理在其投資決策中應用ESG因素。\n\n關於私人市場投資，香港金融管理局（HKMA）會在其盡職調查過程中審視一般合夥人的環境、社會及管治（ESG）政策與實踐。特別是，在所有長期一般合夥人（LTGP）投資中，ESG風險評估是盡職調查的必備部分。針對LTGP，香港金融管理局投資具有可持續特性的項目；例如，自2013年起，香港金融管理局在能源領域進行直接投資及共同投資，投資於可再生能源，同時在其房地產組合中投資具有綠色及可持續特性的綠色建築及倉庫。展望未來，香港金融管理局將繼續尋找具有可持續特性的項目，並把綠色認證作為房地產投資的主要考量因素。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）將密切監測ESG標準的發展，並評估這些標準如何進一步融入其投資流程。此過程透過與志同道合的投資者及相關國際組織的合作而得以推進。特別是，作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則（UNPRI）的簽署機構，而該原則是全球推動責任投資的領導者，香港金融管理局期望參與制定ESG最佳實踐，並鼓勵其他投資者採納責任投資。此外，香港金融管理局亦為FCLTGlobal的成員，該組織是一個非營利機構，透過舉辦研討會和研究來鼓勵企業和投資決策採用更長遠的視野。2019年，香港金融管理局亦成為氣候相關財務披露工作小組（TCFD）的支持者。\n\n如需了解更多關於香港金融管理局（HKMA）的RI政策框架的資料，請參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2019年金融市場\n\n儘管存在對全球增長放緩和美中貿易緊張局勢的擔憂，2019年全球金融市場在主要央行寬鬆貨幣政策的推動下表現良好。繼2018年第四季度出現顯著修正後，全球股市在2019年出現反彈。在債券市場方面，主要政府債券收益率在2019年前三個季度顯著下降，債券價格因貨幣政策放鬆而上漲。儘管第四季度債券價格在收益率小幅回升的背景下有所回落，但整體而言，2019年債券市場的表現仍令人滿意。\n\n在貨幣市場中，主要貨幣對美元的表現各不相同。由於美中貿易緊張局勢升級，人民幣在第三季度下跌了3.8%，但在第四季度隨著貿易緊張局勢緩和，部分收復了之前的跌幅。整體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。雖然由於無協議脫歐風險升級，英鎊在第三季度下跌了3.2%，但隨著第四季度脫歐問題出現更多明朗化跡象，英鎊大幅反彈，最終對美元升值了4.0%。\n\n2019年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現如表1所示。\n\n# 储備基金的表現\n\n2019年，儲備基金的投資收入為2622億港元。其中，債券收益為1145億港元，香港股票收益為221億港元，其他股票收益為1007億港元，非港元資產的貨幣翻譯效果為負130億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益為379億港元。另外，戰略組合的估值收益為25億港元。\n\n截至年尾，儲備基金的總資產達到4,2067億港元。長期投資計劃（LTGP）下的投資市值合共為3,351億港元，其中私人股權為2,334億港元，房地產為1,017億港元。未償還的投資承諾達2,193億港元。\n\n2019年，扣除戰略組合後，儲備基金的投資回報率為6.6%。具體而言，IP組合的回報率為9.7%，而Bp組合則為2.5%。自2009年成立以來，LTGP的年化內部回報率為12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n","zh":"# 基金會\n\n- 審計主任報告  \n- 貨幣基金財務報表\n\n# 審計主任報告書\n\n# 獨立核數師報告書 致財政司司長\n\n# 評論\n\n我證明我已審計了香港儲備基金及其附屬機構（「該集團」）的財務報表，載於第187至293頁，包括香港儲備基金及該集團截至2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及該年度的收支賬戶、綜合收益表、股東權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要會計政策摘要。\n\n依我之見，截至2019年12月31日止，基金及集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現和現金流量，其財務報表均根據香港會計師公會（「HKICPA」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「HKFRSs」）編製，並符合根據《儲備基金條例》（第66章）第7條頒佈的行政長官指示，真實而公允地反映了基金及集團的財務狀況。\n\n# 意見基礎\n\n我根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條頒發的指示，以及審計委員會的審計標準進行審計。我在這些標準下的責任，進一步說明於我報告書中「審計師對財務報表審計的責任」一節。根據這些標準，我與該集團保持獨立，並已按照這些標準履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據已經足夠且適當，足以作為我發表意見的基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項係指依我專業判斷，在2019年12月31日止年度財務報表之審計過程中，最具重要性之事項。這些事項係於我審計財務報表整體之脈絡中加以處理，並作為我形成審計意見之基礎，我並未就這些事項另行提供意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債按公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表中的註釋2.5、2.6和38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額為3,874,223百萬港元，金融負債總額為1,158,686百萬港元，均按公允價值計量。\n\n這些財務資產中有91%以及所有這些財務負債，其公允價值係根據活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層輸入值）或根據使用可觀察市場數據作為輸入值的估值技術所估算（第二層輸入值）。\n\n其餘9%的這些金融資產，其公允價值是根據非基於可觀察市場數據的評估技術（第三層輸入）估算的。這些金融資產總計為3387.58億港元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於涉及的金額龐大且估計複雜，以公允價值計量金融資產和金融負債是關鍵審計事項。\n\n對按公允價值計量的金融資產和金融負債進行評估的審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解用以評估不同類別金融資產和金融負債的程序，包括相關的控制措施；\n\n- 評估和測試控制措施，包括相關電腦系統的應用控制；\n\n- 取得有關財務資產和財務負債的估值、存在性、權利和義務以及完整性的外部確認；\n\n- 在使用報價市場價格時，核對價格至獨立來源；\n\n- 在使用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的評估技術時，評估評估方法的適當性及假設的合理性，並核對輸入資料是否來自獨立來源；\n\n- 在使用未以可觀察市場數據為基礎的評估技術時，評估評估方法的適當性以及假設和輸入值的合理性。\n\n# 按公允價值評估投資性不動產\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公允價值列賬，截至2019年12月31日總額為224.81億港元。集團亦持有二十二間合營企業的權益，總額為445.06億港元，這些合營企業的主要業務為持有海外投資物業。無論這些投資物業是由集團直接持有或由合營企業持有，其公允價值主要根據獨立專業評估師的評估確定。此類評估涉及重大的判斷和估計，包括評估方法及所使用的假設。\n\n對按公允價值計量的投資性房地產進行評估的審計程序包括：\n\n- 取得並審閱集團直接持有或透過合營企業持有的投資性物業的評估報告，並核實公允價值是否基於評估報告中所載的評估價值；\n\n- 評估估價師的獨立性和資格；\n\n評估估值方法的適當性以及假設和輸入資料的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣當局負責其他資料。其他資料包括香港貨幣當局2019年度報告中除財務報表及我的審計師報告以外的所有資料。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，我亦不會就該等資訊發表任何形式的保證結論。\n\n關於我對財務報表的審計，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在這樣做時考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不一致，或是否顯然存在重大錯誤。如果根據我所進行的工作，我認為這些其他資訊存在重大錯誤，我必須報告這一情況。在這方面，我沒有任何需要報告的內容。\n\n# 貨幣管理機構及匯兌基金顧問委員會審計小組委員會對財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《儲備基金條例》第7條由行政長官發出的指示，編製真實及公允地反映財務狀況的財務報表，並負責建立貨幣管理局認為對編製無重大錯報（無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致）財務報表所必需的內部控制措施。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣當局負責評估集團持續經營的能力，根據適用情況披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n香港儲備基金諮詢委員會的審計小組委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師對財務報表審計的責任\n\n我的目標是取得合理的確信，以確定財務報表整體是否沒有重大錯報，無論此錯報是因舞弊或錯誤所致，並出具包含我意見的審計師報告。合理的確信是一種高水平的確信，但並不能保證根據審計委員會審計標準進行的審計始終能夠在存在重大錯報時予以發現。錯報可能來自舞弊或錯誤，若個別或合併起來，合理預期會影響依這些財務報表所做出的經濟決策，則視為重大錯報。\n\n根據審計委員會的審計標準進行審計時，我會在整個審計過程中運用專業判斷並保持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n\n- 識別及評估財務報表存在重大錯報的風險，無論該錯報是源自舞弊或錯誤，設計並執行針對這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，作為我發表意見的基礎。未能察覺因舞弊導致的重大錯報風險，高於因錯誤導致的重大錯報風險，因為舞弊可能涉及串通、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或繞過內部控制等行為；\n\n- 為了設計適合情況的審計程序，取得與審計相關的內部控制的了解，但並非為了對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n\n評估貨幣當局所採用的會計政策的適當性，以及其會計估計和相關披露的合理性；\n\n- 就貨幣當局採用持續經營基礎進行會計是否恰當作出結論，並根據所取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在重大不確定性，該不確定性與可能對集團持續經營能力產生重大懷疑的事件或情況有關。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我必須在我們的審計報告中引起注意，指出財務報表中與此相關的披露內容；如果這些披露不充分，則需修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至審計報告日期所取得的審計證據。然而，未來的事件或情況可能會導致集團無法持續經營；\n\n評估財務報表整體的呈報、結構及內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以達致公平呈報的方式反映其背後的交易與事項；並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以對集團內各實體或業務活動的財務資訊發表意見。我負責集團審計的指揮、監督及執行。我對我的審計意見負有全部責任。\n\n我就審計範圍及時間安排、重大審計發現，包括我在審計過程中發現的任何重大內部控制缺陷等事項，與財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會進行溝通。\n\n我也向基金會諮詢委員會的審計小組委員會提交一份聲明，說明我已遵守有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有可能合理認為會影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，並在適用的情況下，說明相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與財政儲備基金諮詢委員會審計小組委員會溝通的資料，我確定在本期財務報表審計中最重要的事項，因此這些事項為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止披露有關事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為披露該事項的負面後果合理預期會超過此類披露所帶來的公眾利益，否則我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項。\n\n朱約翰  \n審計總監\n\n審計委員會  \n26樓  \n入境事務大樓  \n香港灣仔區 Gloucester Road 7號\n\n2020年4月3日\n"}
