{"zh":"# 總裁報告\n\n2016年的全球政經舞台上「黑天鵝」身影頻仍，英國脫歐公投和美國總統大選結果固然令各種民調淪為笑柄，但更出乎意料的卻是金融市場的反應。以美國大選為例，特朗普當選消息令美股三大指數的期貨在開市前急挫，但開市不久美股指數隨即反彈，此後凱歌高奏，屢創新高。連串事件，凸顯了傳統智慧和思維對預測市場能力的局限性，也標誌着未來環球局勢發展的重大不確定性。\n\n過去一年，多項主要金融數據都反映市場情緒異常敏感：美國十年期國庫債券收益率在7月跌至1.36厘歷史低位後，在美國總統大選後的12月中旬飆升至2.6厘。反映美元兌一籃子貨幣走勢的美匯指數在年底升至14年高位；紐約原油期貨價格由年初每桶26美元低位反彈至年底的54美元。本港股市方面，恒生指數全年微升86點，但期內峰谷差逾6,000點。外圍形勢驚濤駭浪，更形金融體系尤其是貨幣和銀行體系穩定的重要和可貴。\n\n2016年1月，國際對沖基金部署狙擊人民幣和港元的傳言甚囂塵上，人心虛怯。金管局迅即向市場發放明確、堅定的訊息，我們絕對有信心、有能力捍衛聯匯制度和香港的金融體系穩定，適時穩住了市場信心。綜觀2016年全年，港元長時間貼近強方兌換保證。由於銀行體系資金非常充裕，即使去年12月和今年3月美國聯儲局加息，對港元利率和匯率並未有明顯的即時影響。\n\n香港銀行體系繼續穩步發展，去年整體貸款錄得6.5%溫和增長，資產質素保持良好，不良貸款比率維持在0.85%的健康水平，遠低於2000年以來約2%的長期平均水平。銀行體系的資本充足率和流動性比率均保持在高於法定要求的高水平。在樓宇按揭業務方面，經過七輪逆周期措施，新造住宅物業按揭平均成數從2009年9月的64%下降至2016年底的51%，平均供款與入息比率也從2010年8月的41%下降至2016年底的34%，為樓市周期一旦逆轉而令銀行體系受到衝擊時，提供了所需的緩衝。金管局會繼續密切留意樓市的發展，因應周期變化而採取合適措施，以保持銀行體系穩定。\n\n進一步強化銀行體系穩定的立法工作去年取得令人鼓舞的進展。優化存款保障制度和針對金融機構「大得不能倒」風險的兩條法例，及時在上屆立法會任期屆滿前順利通過。前者加快存款保障金的發放速度，簡化發放程序，有助加強存戶對銀行體系的信心；後者則為包括銀行在內的金融機構建立處置機制，防範這些機構一旦倒閉而引發的系統性金融風險，並盡量避免動用公帑為它們「包底埋單」。金管局已在今年4月1日設立處置機制辦公室，落實執行法例的要求和跟進工作。\n\n銀行業素有「百業之母」之稱，是實體經濟和普羅市民日常生活倚重的儲蓄、支付渠道和信貸來源。年內，部分中小企業界代表反映融資有困難。金管局即時與銀行界溝通，希望銀行在維持審慎風險管理的情況下，盡可能為中小企的營運和發展繼續提供資金支援。我們又透過轄下香港按揭證券公司，加強向工商界推廣政府的「中小企融資擔保計劃」，並與銀行業界緊密溝通，以釋除疑慮、釐清誤解及理順處理壞帳的索償程序，從而提高銀行參與該計劃的意願。多管齊下，收到了一定成效，根據金管局對銀行進行的調查，中小企整體信貸額度在去年保持平穩，超過九成企業的信貸額度得以維持甚至增加。同時，「中小企融資擔保計劃」的申請數字亦明顯上升。\n\n近年來金管局大力推動普及金融，就是考慮到基本銀行服務已是營商和日常生活不可或缺的環節。去年當我們得知有些海外公司和初創企業在香港開戶遇到困難後，旋即展開跟進工作，與多個國際商會和企業協會聯繫，並跟銀行業界深入溝通，對症下藥。去年9月我向香港所有銀行簽發通告，闡釋應如何理解金管局針對反洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集活動的「風險為本」監管原則，如何將這項原則應用在開戶申請和對現有客戶的盡職審查措施上，強調銀行不應對所有客戶採用「一刀切」的要求和程序。經我們與銀行和商界協商後，企業開戶情況有所改善，但仍有進步空間，這也是我們今年工作重點之一。\n\n普及金融還涉及銀行分行服務的覆蓋面。金管局一直鼓勵銀行在營商圖利之餘，也要顧及市民的基本銀行服務需要。金融科技一日千里，銀行提供服務的渠道也更趨多元化。除了日益普及的網上銀行服務外，去年多家銀行紛紛推出流動銀行車或視像櫃員機服務，提供較傳統櫃員機更貼身、更全面的銀行服務。在我們的推動下，多家銀行也計劃在偏遠地區設立實體分行，加強對當區居民的服務。\n\n金融中心的發展就如逆水行舟，因此，金管局多年來不斷為香港金融業發展尋求新的契機，開拓新的領域。2016年可說是成果豐碩的一年，當中又以金融科技(Fintech)和基建融資為亮點。\n\n在金融科技方面，香港的零售支付服務在2016年進入新時代。金管局去年發出13個儲值支付工具牌照，通過發牌和恒常監管制度為零售支付服務創造有利的營商環境，配以一系列公眾教育宣傳，讓消費者在享受新科技帶來的便捷之餘，權益也得到合理保障。\n\n此外，去年3月金管局成立了金融科技促進辦公室，以此平台推動與銀行業相關的金融科技發展。幾個月間，我們推出多項新猷，包括「網絡防衛計劃」(Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative)，為強化銀行體系網絡安全建立風險評估、資訊共享和人才培訓三足鼎立的新平台。我們並與香港應用科技研究院（應科院）合作，開展分布式分類帳技術(distributed ledger technology)專項研究，探討該技術在香港銀行業應用的可行性，並在應科院設立金融科技創新中心(Fintech Innovation Hub)，為銀行業界和金融科技界提供技術支援。金管局的銀行監管部門還設立「金融科技監管沙盒」(Fintech Supervisory Sandbox)，讓銀行在較小和可控範圍內測試新技術的應用，為新產品、新服務的開發提速。自去年9月至今年3月，已有6家銀行共14項新技術項目使用沙盒進行測試，部分項目亦已相繼推出市場，為市民帶來更多金融科技的新產品。\n\n世界各地對基建融資的需求巨大，特別是「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，基建融資更成中外矚目的議題。香港是亞洲的國際金融中心，在基建融資領域極具優勢。去年7月金管局成立了基建融資促進辦公室(Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office，簡稱IFFO)，搭建一個嶄新和獨特的平台，匯聚60多家世界級的多邊機構、機構投資者、銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構、基建項目的建設和營運方、各類專業機構等，就基建投融資課題互通訊息、交流經驗、尋求合作機會。IFFO成立至今已舉辦十多場大型會議、研討會和工作坊，金管局並分別與國際金融公司(International Finance Corporation)、全球基礎設施中心(Global Infrastructure Hub)、國家開發銀行(China Development Bank)和中國進出口銀行(The Export-Import Bank of China)簽署了共同促進基建投融資活動的《諒解備忘錄》。起步時間雖然不長，但為香港未來作為基建投融資中心奠下堅實的基礎。\n\n拆牆鬆綁是提升競爭力的不二法門。年內，金管局積極參與和支援特區政府修訂稅務條例，向在港經營集團內部財資業務的企業提供有利的稅務環境。我們並積極接觸跨國企業，吸引它們來港發展或擴充企業財資活動，藉此進一步強化香港金融市場的功能。\n\n去年的離岸人民幣市場處於調整期。受市場波動和對人民幣匯率預期等因素影響，全球離岸人民幣資金池規模普遍收縮。儘管如此，香港仍穩執離岸人民幣業務的牛耳，保持全球最大的人民幣資金池，經香港結算的人民幣維持在日均約8,600億元人民幣高位。為進一步優化香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性安排，去年10月我們將一級流動性提供行由7家增至9家，支援雙邊流動資金的總額度由原來的140億元人民幣增至180億元，確保在離岸人民幣市場資金出現緊絀的情況下，仍可保持市場有序運作。去年12月股票市場「深港通」開通，令香港的人民幣業務再添動力。金管局亦正與內地有關當局研究「債券通」方案，進一步便利兩地投資者參與債券市場，並優化債券市場基礎設施的聯繫。\n\n儘管去年全球投資環境充斥着各種不穩因素，但有賴於過去一段時間所採取的多項防禦性部署，外匯基金去年錄得681億港元投資收入。自1994年以來外匯基金的複合年度投資回報率達4.8%，高於同期2.1%的本地通脹率。\n\n外匯基金將繼續推動多元化投資，包括進一步擴展資產類別，加大對於信貸資產、抵禦通脹類投資產品和新興市場的投資。而作為多元化投資旗艦的「長期增長組合」，透過私募股權和房地產項目等投資於另類資產。該組合自2009年啟動以來一直保持不俗的成績，成立至今的平均內部回報率年率約12%，而隨着政府「未來基金」部分投放於該組合，我們加快了投資步伐，去年底「長期增長組合」的資產規模約1,818億港元，已批出但未提取作投資的總額約1,338億港元。外匯基金將繼續恪守「保本先行、長期增值」的投資策略，在保持充裕的流動性和備用資金的前提下，尋求長遠穩定的回報。\n","en":"# President's Report\n\nThe global political and economic landscape of 2016 was punctuated by frequent \"black swan\" events. While the results of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election certainly mocked various polls, the market reaction was even more unexpected. Take the US election as an example: news of Trump's victory initially caused futures on the three major US stock indices to plummet before the opening bell, but the indices soon rebounded and subsequently soared, repeatedly reaching new highs. These events highlight the limitations of traditional wisdom and thinking in predicting market performance and mark a significant uncertainty in the future development of global affairs.\n\nOver the past year, several key financial data points have reflected unusually sensitive market sentiment: the yield on U.S. ten-year Treasury bonds fell to a historic low of 1.36% in July, then surged to 2.6% in mid-December following the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar's performance against a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-year high at year-end; and the price of New York crude oil futures rebounded from a low of $26 per barrel at the beginning of the year to $54 per barrel by year-end. As for the Hong Kong stock market, the Hang Seng Index edged up 86 points for the year, but the difference between its peak and trough exceeded 6,000 points. The turbulent external environment underscores the importance and value of stability within the financial system, particularly the monetary and banking systems.\n\nIn January 2016, rumors of international hedge funds targeting the Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar were rampant, causing widespread anxiety. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority swiftly issued clear and resolute messages to the market, assuring that we were absolutely confident and capable of defending the linked exchange rate system and the stability of Hong Kong's financial system, thereby stabilizing market confidence. Throughout the entire year of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar remained closely aligned with the strong side of the exchange rate assurance scheme. Due to the banking system's ample liquidity, even the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes in December of last year and March of this year had no noticeable immediate impact on Hong Kong dollar interest rates and exchange rates.\n\nHong Kong's banking system continued to develop steadily, with overall loans recording a moderate growth of 6.5% last year. Asset quality remained sound, and the non-performing loan ratio was maintained at a healthy level of 0.85%, significantly below the long-term average of approximately 2% since 2000. The capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio of the banking system both remained at high levels exceeding regulatory requirements. In the area of mortgage lending, following seven rounds of counter-cyclical measures, the average loan-to-value ratio for new residential properties decreased from 64% in September 2009 to 51% by the end of 2016, and the average debt-to-income ratio also fell from 41% in August 2010 to 34% by the end of 2016, providing a necessary buffer should the property market cycle reverse and impact the banking system. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor developments in the property market and take appropriate measures in response to cyclical changes to maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nLegislative work to further strengthen the stability of the banking system made encouraging progress last year. Two ordinances optimizing the deposit insurance system and addressing the “too big to fail” risk of financial institutions were successfully passed before the end of the previous Legislative Council term. The former accelerates the disbursement of deposit insurance funds and simplifies the disbursement process, helping to strengthen depositors' confidence in the banking system. The latter establishes a resolution mechanism for financial institutions, including banks, to prevent systemic financial risks arising from their potential collapse and to avoid using public funds to “bail them out.” The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established a Resolution Mechanism Office in April 1 this year to implement the requirements of the ordinances and follow up on related work.\n\nThe banking sector has long been known as the \"mother of all industries,\" serving as a vital channel for savings, payments, and credit for the real economy and the daily lives of ordinary citizens. This year, some representatives from the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector reported difficulties in securing financing. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) immediately communicated with the banking sector, hoping that banks would continue to provide funding support for the operations and development of SMEs while maintaining prudent risk management. We have also, through our subsidiary Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, strengthened the promotion of the government's \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" to the business community, and maintained close communication with the banking sector to dispel doubts, clarify misunderstandings, and streamline the claims process for bad debts, thereby increasing banks' willingness to participate in the scheme. Through these multifaceted efforts, we have achieved certain results. According to an HKMA survey of banks, the overall credit limit for SMEs remained stable last year, and over 90% of businesses maintained or even increased their credit limits. Simultaneously, the number of applications for the \"SME Financing Guarantee Scheme\" has also risen significantly.\n\nIn recent years, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau has vigorously promoted financial inclusion, recognizing that basic banking services are an indispensable part of both business operations and daily life. Last year, when we learned that some overseas companies and startups were encountering difficulties opening accounts in Hong Kong, we promptly initiated follow-up work, connecting with various international chambers of commerce and business associations, and engaging in in-depth communication with the banking sector to address the issues directly. In September of last year, I issued a circular to all banks in Hong Kong, clarifying how to understand the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau’s “risk-based” regulatory principles concerning anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, and how to apply this principle to account opening applications and due diligence measures for existing clients, emphasizing that banks should not adopt a “one-size-fits-all” approach to customer requirements and procedures. Following consultations with banks and the business community, the situation regarding corporate account openings has improved, but there is still room for further progress, which is a key focus of our work this year.\n\nExpanding financial services also involves the reach of bank branch services. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau has consistently encouraged banks, while pursuing business interests, to also consider the basic banking needs of the public. With the rapid advancement of financial technology, the channels through which banks provide services are becoming increasingly diverse. In addition to the increasingly popular online banking services, several banks launched mobile banking vehicles or video teller machines last year, offering more personalized and comprehensive banking services than traditional ATMs. Under our advocacy, several banks are also planning to establish physical branches in remote areas to strengthen services for local residents.\n\nThe development of a financial center is like rowing a boat against the current; therefore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has consistently sought new opportunities and explored new areas to foster the growth of Hong Kong's financial industry over the years. 2016 proved to be a year of fruitful results, with financial technology (Fintech) and infrastructure financing as key highlights.\n\nIn the realm of financial technology, retail payment services in Hong Kong entered a new era in 2016. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued 13 stored-value facilities licenses last year, creating a favorable business environment for retail payment services through a licensing and ongoing regulatory system. Coupled with a series of public education campaigns, this ensures that consumers enjoy the convenience of new technologies while their rights are reasonably protected.\n\nFurthermore, in March of last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office as a platform to promote fintech development related to the banking sector. Over several months, we launched a number of new initiatives, including the \"Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative,\" creating a new framework of risk assessment, information sharing, and talent training to strengthen cybersecurity within the banking system. We also partnered with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) to conduct dedicated research on distributed ledger technology, exploring its feasibility for application in Hong Kong's banking industry, and established a Fintech Innovation Hub at ASTRI to provide technical support to both the banking and fintech sectors. The HKMA’s banking supervision department has also established a \"Fintech Supervisory Sandbox,\" allowing banks to test the application of new technologies within a smaller, controlled environment, accelerating the development of new products and services. From September last year to March this year, six banks have used the Sandbox to test a total of 14 new technology projects, with some projects already being launched in the market, bringing more fintech products to the public.\n\nThe global demand for infrastructure financing is substantial, particularly since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has made infrastructure financing a key topic of interest both domestically and internationally. Hong Kong, as Asia’s international financial center, possesses significant advantages in this field. In July last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) to create a new and unique platform, bringing together over 60 world-class multilateral organizations, institutional investors, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, as well as project developers and operators, various professional organizations, to exchange information, share experiences, and seek cooperation opportunities regarding infrastructure investment and financing. Since its inception, IFFO has hosted more than a dozen large-scale conferences, seminars, and workshops. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also signed Memoranda of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation, the Global Infrastructure Hub, the China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of China, to jointly promote infrastructure investment and financing activities. Although its start-up period has been relatively short, IFFO has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s future as a center for infrastructure financing.\n\nRemoving barriers and easing regulations is the only way to enhance competitiveness. Within the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has actively participated in and supported the Special Administrative Region government in revising tax laws, providing a favorable tax environment for companies conducting treasury operations within Hong Kong-based groups. We have also proactively engaged with multinational corporations to attract them to develop or expand their corporate treasury activities in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening the functions of Hong Kong's financial market.\n\nLast year's offshore RMB market was in a period of adjustment. Influenced by market volatility and expectations regarding the RMB exchange rate, the global pool of offshore RMB funds generally contracted. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its leading position in offshore RMB business, retaining the world’s largest RMB fund pool, with RMB transactions cleared through Hong Kong averaging approximately 860 billion RMB per day. To further optimize the liquidity arrangements of Hong Kong's offshore RMB market, we increased the number of primary liquidity providing banks from seven to nine last October, and raised the total quota for bilateral liquidity support from 14 billion RMB to 18 billion RMB, ensuring the orderly operation of the market even when the offshore RMB market experiences liquidity constraints. The launch of the \"Stock Connect\" scheme between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in December further boosted Hong Kong's RMB business. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also working with mainland authorities to study the \"Bond Connect\" scheme, further facilitating participation by investors from both places in the bond market and optimizing the connectivity of bond market infrastructure.\n\nDespite a global investment environment fraught with various uncertainties last year, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 68.1 billion, thanks to a series of defensive measures implemented over the past period. Since 1994, the Exchange Fund’s annualized compounded investment return has reached 4.8%, exceeding the local inflation rate of 2.1% for the same period.\n\nThe Exchange Fund will continue to promote diversified investments, including further expanding asset categories and increasing investments in credit assets, inflation-hedging investment products, and emerging markets. The \"Long-Term Growth Portfolio,\" a flagship of our diversified investment strategy, invests in alternative assets such as private equity and real estate projects. Since its launch in 2009, the portfolio has consistently delivered strong performance, with an average annualized internal rate of return of approximately 12% to date. With the government’s “Future Fund” portion allocated to the portfolio, we have accelerated our investment pace. As of the end of last year, the portfolio’s asset size was approximately HKD 181.8 billion, with a total of approximately HKD 133.8 billion approved but not yet drawn for investment. The Exchange Fund will continue to adhere to its investment strategy of \"prioritizing capital preservation and long-term appreciation,\" seeking stable and sustainable returns while maintaining ample liquidity and reserve funds.\n"}

{"zh":"# 經濟及金融環境\n\n隨着環球經濟及貿易活動疲弱，香港經濟增長在2016年回軟。面對外圍環境不明朗因素加劇，預期2017年經濟增長仍然溫和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概覽\n\n香港經濟增長在2016年放緩，實質本地生產總值增長由2015年的2.4%降至1.9%（表1）。淨出口是主要拖累，當中訪港旅遊業疲弱令服務輸出受壓（圖1）。本地需求動力亦放緩，但繼續為整體經濟增長提供主要支持。勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持於3.3至3.4%的低位。由於本地成本及外部價格壓力減退，消費物價通脹進一步放緩。面對波動的外圍環境及多變的市場氣氛，資產市場增添起伏。鑑於住宅物業市場再度暢旺，政府於11月實施新印花稅措施。\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元利率上升，本港外匯及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順。港元現貨匯率於1月份略為轉弱後一直在7.75附近水平徘徊。年內兌換保證並無被觸發，總結餘與未償還外匯基金票據及債券合計幾乎維持不變，約為1.2萬億港元。繼美國於12月中加息後，金管局基本利率由0.75厘上調至1厘。香港銀行同業拆息及較長期債券收益率維持在相對較低水平，但在接近年底時稍升，部分反映美元相應拆息及收益率的走勢。整體銀行貸款增長在2016年加快至6.5%。雖然整體貸款質素略為轉差，但特定分類貸款比率仍然維持在極低水平。\n\n圖 1 組成部分對實質本地生產總值增長的貢獻\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n表 1 按開支項目計的實質本地生產總值增長（比對上期）\n\n註：本地固定資本形成總額經季節因素調整的按季增減幅度不詳。\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 本地需求\n\n本地需求的增長力度在2016年略為減弱。儘管穩定的就業及收入狀況繼續為私人消費帶來支持，但其增速仍降至1.6%，部分反映經濟不明朗因素加劇。政府消費增長亦略為減慢至3.3%。本地固定資本形成總額繼續按季大幅上落（圖2），累計全年收縮0.5%。私營部門機器及設備購置成為主要拖累，在營商前景欠佳下連續第3年收縮，而樓宇及建造活動則因住屋動工項目增加而轉殷。\n\n圖 2 本地需求\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港出口在接近2016年底時有回穩跡象，但綜合全年表現仍然乏力（圖3）。貨品出口較2015年的低基數上升1.7%。香港對先進經濟體的出口仍然呆滯；但在區內貿易流動轉趨穩定下，香港對中國內地、印度、韓國、新加坡及台灣的出口則較2015年好轉。\n\n部分反映零售銷售在近年急速增長後轉趨正常化，香港服務輸出在2016年顯著收縮3.1%。貨品進口在2015年收縮後於2016年收復部分失地，服務輸入則部分受惠於本地居民外遊意欲而持續增長。2016年整體貿易順差收窄，拖累本地經濟增長。\n\n圖 3 貨品出口及服務輸出\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 通脹\n\n通脹壓力在2016年仍然受控。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基本通脹率由2015年的2.5%下降至2016年的2.3%（圖4）。在早前新訂私人住宅租金下調所帶來的傳遞效應下，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹回落。受惠於全球商品價格偏軟及港元強勢，進口價格通脹受到遏抑。另一方面，在勞工成本穩定增長及租金成本壓力（尤其零售範疇）有所紓緩下，本地成本壓力保持溫和。\n\n圖 4 基本消費物價通脹\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n勞工市場在2016年大致保持穩定，勞工供求升幅相若。按行業分析，旅遊相關行業的勞工市場狀況轉差，其他行業則大致平穩。整體而言，經季節因素調整失業率由2015年的3.3%稍升至3.4%（圖5）。在勞工市場穩定下，名義工資在首3季上升3.8%，而2015年的升幅為4.6%。首3季實質工資亦上升0.9%，而2015年的升幅為1.5%。\n\n圖 5 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在2016年大幅上落。受到人民幣貶值壓力及內地股市波動所影響，恒生指數於2月份跌至3年來的低位（圖6）。本港股市在3月份跟隨美國及其他主要股市顯著造好而回升。儘管英國脫歐公投觸發市場波動，但在外界預期美國聯邦儲備局會放緩加息步伐及其他主要央行推行貨幣寬鬆政策下，市場氣氛迅速改善。恒生指數於9月份升至24,100點的一年高位。然而，受到美國總統選舉結果及預計美國會加快加息步伐所影響，本港股市在第4季再度受壓。整體而言，恒生指數於2016年微升0.4%，在2015年則下跌7.2%。平均每日成交額由上年的1,056億港元降至669億港元，而本港股市集資總額亦由上年的11,156億港元減少至4,901億港元。\n\n圖 6 資產價格\n資料來源：差餉物業估價署及香港交易及結算所有限公司。\n\n# 物業市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2016年略為波動。物業成交量於第1季錄得歷史新低後，在其後數月有所回升，但在11月推出新印花稅措施後再度下挫。整體而言，成交量在2016年稍跌至54,701宗。另一方面，樓價自第2季起上升並超越2015年9月的高位，2016年的累計升幅為7.8%（圖6）。置業負擔能力依然偏緊，樓價與收入比率為15.9，超越1997年的歷史高位；而收入槓桿比率為72.0%，遠高於長期平均水平。2 由於銀行推出具競爭力的按揭計劃，按揭利率稍為回落，於接近年底時則跟隨香港銀行同業拆息上升而略為回升。工商物業市場方面，全年交投大致保持穩定。由於非住宅物業價格較2015年高位回落，相應租金收益率較上年微升，但仍處於低位。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n預期2017年實質本地生產總值增長將保持溫和。政府預測經濟增長幅度介乎2至3%之間，私營機構分析員預測增幅平均為2.0%。外圍方面，隨着環球宏觀經濟及金融環境變得不明朗，全球經濟及貿易增長或會保持溫和；再加上港元實質有效匯率因美元強勢而上升，將會抑制香港的出口表現。本地方面，雖然穩定的就業及收入狀況會支持消費，但受利率上升所拖累，預期私人消費會溫和增長。受惠於住屋供應增加及多個基建項目展開，樓宇及建造活動應會穩步增長，但營商氣氛疲弱及利率趨升將影響商界資本投資。\n\n# 通脹及勞工市場\n\n預計2017年通脹壓力仍然溫和。一方面環球商品價格上漲及中國內地通脹趨升或會令進口價格上升，另一方面港元轉強卻可能會令上述壓力受到遏抑。在溫和的經濟動力下，本地成本壓力仍可受控，但由於新訂住宅租金於2017年初上升，綜合消費物價指數中的租金組成項目通脹可能會稍升。市場共識預測2017年整體通脹率為1.9%，政府預期基本通脹率為2.0%。雖然不明朗因素加劇或會影響招聘意欲，私營機構分析員預計2017年失業率會維持於3.4%。\n\n# 不明朗因素及風險\n\n2017年經濟前景會受制於眾多不明朗因素，當中來自外圍環境的影響尤甚。美國新一屆政府政策的不確定性，將令環球經濟前景變得不明朗，當中可能出現的保護主義政策亦會對全球貿易帶來阻力。英國脫歐進程及歐洲幾個主要國家舉行大選，亦可能導致資產市場波動，並影響港元資金流向。此外，美國利率正常化將會令本地貨幣狀況收緊，並對實質經濟及資產價格構成下調壓力；當中樓市繼續偏緊，市場前景仍然很不明朗。短期而言，按揭息率仍然偏低、就業及收入狀況穩定，以及地產發展商加推優惠（例如折扣及現金回贈）令累積的購買力獲得釋放，均可為住宅需求帶來支持。另一方面，新印花稅措施、美國可能加快加息步伐及房屋供應穩步增長，則可能繼續為樓市帶來阻力。\n\n# 銀行體系表現\n\n儘管本港經濟面對阻力，加上國際政治事件出乎意料的結果令市場波動加劇，香港銀行體系在2016年仍然穩健。認可機構的資本及流動性狀況維持良好，資產質素輕微轉差，但仍處於健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨着美國利率上升，香港銀行同業拆息在11月及12月顯著上升。反映零售銀行港元資金成本的綜合利率則輕微上升（圖7）。\n\n圖 7 香港銀行同業拆息、綜合利率及最優惠貸款利率\n\n註：\n1. 香港銀行同業拆息（每月平均數）由香港銀行公會公布。\n2. 最優惠貸款利率（每月平均數）是參考香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司所報利率。\n\n# 盈利走勢\n\n零售銀行在2016年的盈利略為改善，其香港業務的整體除稅前經營溢利增長8.7%。增長主要是由外匯及衍生工具業務收入（+39.7%）、附屬公司派發的股息收入（+123.5%）及淨利息收入（+2.8%）所帶動，不過部份增長被費用及佣金收入減少(-11.3%)所抵銷。零售銀行除稅後溢利錄得44.4%的升幅，增長主要來自非經常項目。零售銀行除稅後平均資產回報率亦相應由2015 年的 1.04% 上升至 1.44%（圖 8）。\n\n圖8 零售銀行的表現\n\n2016年零售銀行淨息差為1.32%，與2015年的水平相同（圖9）。雖然零售銀行繼續將剩餘資金配置於息率較低而流動性較高的金融投資，但利息收益的減少被利息成本下降所抵銷。\n\n圖9 零售銀行淨息差\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總經營收入的比例為44.3%，大致維持穩定。雖然費用與佣金收入下跌11.3%，但股息收入及外匯與衍生工具業務收入分別上升123.5%及39.7%。\n","en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAs global economic and trade activity weakens, Hong Kong's economic growth softened in 2016. Given the increasing uncertainty in the external environment, economic growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Overview\n\nHong Kong's economic growth slowed in 2016, with real gross domestic product growth declining from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.9% (Table 1). Net exports were the main drag, with a weak inbound tourism sector putting pressure on service exports (Figure 1). Local demand momentum also eased, but continued to provide the main support for overall economic growth. The labor market remained broadly stable, with the unemployment rate holding steady at a low of 3.3% to 3.4%. Consumer price inflation continued to decelerate due to easing local costs and external price pressures. Amidst a volatile external environment and fluctuating market sentiment, asset markets experienced increased volatility. Given the resurgence of the residential property market, the government implemented new stamp duty measures in November.\n\nDespite external volatility and rising US interest rates, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets continued to operate smoothly. The Hong Kong dollar spot rate weakened slightly in January and has since hovered around the 7.75 level. The exchange rate assurance scheme was not triggered during the year, and the aggregate balance of the Exchange Fund, together with outstanding exchange fund bills and bonds, remained almost unchanged at approximately HKD 1.2 trillion. Following the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike in mid-December, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) base rate was raised from 0.75% to 1%. Interbank offered rates and yields on longer-term bonds remained at relatively low levels, but edged up towards the end of the year, partly reflecting the movements in US equivalent rates. Overall bank lending growth accelerated to 6.5% in 2016. While overall loan quality deteriorated slightly, specific classified loan ratios remained at very low levels.\n\nFigure 1 shows the contribution of various components to real gross domestic product growth.\nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Category (Compared to Previous Period)\n\nNote: The magnitude of quarterly increases or decreases in the total fixed capital formation in this region, after seasonal adjustments, is not specified.\nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Local demand\n\nThe pace of local demand growth moderated slightly in 2016. While stable employment and income conditions continued to support private consumption, its growth slowed to 1.6%, partly reflecting heightened economic uncertainty. Government consumption growth also eased slightly to 3.3%. Total gross fixed capital formation locally continued to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis (Figure 2), resulting in a 0.5% contraction for the year as a whole. Investment in machinery and equipment by the private sector was the main drag, contracting for the third consecutive year amid weak business prospects, while building and construction activity turned positive due to increased residential construction starts.\n\nFigure 2 Local Demand\nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# External Requirements\n\nHong Kong’s exports showed signs of stabilization around the end of 2016, but overall performance for the year remained weak (Figure 3). Merchandise exports rose 1.7% compared to the low base of 2015. Exports to advanced economies remained sluggish; however, exports to mainland China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan improved compared to 2015, benefiting from a more stable flow of intra-regional trade.\n\nSome indicators reflect a normalization of retail sales after a period of rapid growth in recent years, and Hong Kong's service exports contracted significantly by 3.1% in 2016. Merchandise imports recovered some ground in 2016 after a contraction in 2015, while service imports continued to grow, partly benefiting from local residents' increased desire to travel abroad. The overall trade surplus narrowed in 2016, weighing on the local economic growth.\n\nFigure 3: Merchandise Exports and Service Exports\nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained contained in 2016. Excluding the impact of one-off relief measures by the government, the underlying inflation rate decreased from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.3% in 2016 (Figure 4). The inflation component of rental values within the composite consumer price index moderated, reflecting the lagged effects of recent downward adjustments in private residential rents. Weaker global commodity prices and a strong Hong Kong dollar helped to contain import price inflation. On the other hand, domestic cost pressures remained mild, benefiting from stable labor cost growth and a moderation in rental cost pressures, particularly in the retail sector.\n\nFigure 4: Basic Consumer Price Inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labor market\n\nThe labor market remained relatively stable in 2016, with roughly equal increases in labor supply and demand. By industry, the labor market conditions in the tourism sector deteriorated, while other industries remained largely stable. Overall, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 3.3% in 2015 to 3.4% (Figure 5). Amidst this stable labor market, nominal wages increased by 3.8% in the first three quarters, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2015. Real wages also rose by 0.9% in the first three quarters, compared to a 1.5% increase in 2015.\n\nFigure 5 Labor Market Conditions\nSource: Government Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong's stock market experienced significant volatility in 2016. Affected by depreciation pressure on the Renminbi and fluctuations in the mainland Chinese stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell to a three-year low in February (Figure 6). In March, the local stock market rebounded, following the strong performance of US and other major stock markets. Despite market volatility triggered by the Brexit referendum, the atmosphere quickly improved as the market anticipated a slowdown in interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and monetary easing policies by other major central banks. The Hang Seng Index reached a one-year high of 24,100 points in September. However, influenced by the results of the US presidential election and expectations of accelerated interest rate hikes by the US, the local stock market came under pressure again in the fourth quarter. Overall, the Hang Seng Index rose slightly by 0.4% in 2016, compared to a 7.2% decline in 2015. The average daily turnover decreased from HKD 105.6 billion the previous year to HKD 66.9 billion, and the total capital raised by the local stock market also fell from HKD 111.56 billion to HKD 49.01 billion.\n\nFigure 6: Asset Prices\nData Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property Market\n\nThe residential property market experienced slight fluctuations in 2016. After recording a historic low in the first quarter, transaction volumes rebounded in the following months, but declined again after the introduction of new stamp duty measures in November. Overall, transaction volumes decreased slightly to 54,701 in 2016. On the other hand, property prices rose from the second quarter onwards, surpassing the high reached in September 2015, with a cumulative increase of 7.8% for the year (Figure 6). Home affordability remained tight, with a price-to-income ratio of 15.9, exceeding the historical high of 1997; and a debt-to-income ratio of 72.0%, significantly above the long-term average. Mortgage rates edged down due to competitive mortgage plans offered by banks, but rose slightly towards the end of the year, tracking the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate. In the commercial property market, trading activity remained relatively stable throughout the year. As non-residential property prices retreated from their 2015 highs, corresponding rental yields increased slightly compared to the previous year, but remained low.\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic environment\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to remain moderate in 2017. The government forecasts economic growth of 2 to 3%, while private sector analysts predict an average increase of 2.0%. Externally, global economic and financial conditions are becoming increasingly uncertain, which may lead to moderate global economic and trade growth. Furthermore, the Hong Kong dollar’s real effective exchange rate has risen due to the strength of the US dollar, which will dampen Hong Kong’s export performance. Domestically, while stable employment and income conditions will support consumption, private consumption is expected to grow moderately, weighed down by rising interest rates. Building and construction activities should grow steadily, benefiting from increased housing supply and the commencement of several infrastructure projects, but weak business sentiment and rising interest rates will affect business capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain mild in 2017. On the one hand, rising global commodity prices and increasing inflation on the mainland may lead to higher import prices. On the other hand, a stronger Hong Kong dollar could dampen these pressures. With moderate economic momentum, underlying cost pressures should remain manageable, but inflation in the rental component of the Composite Consumer Price Index may rise slightly due to increases in newly contracted residential rents at the beginning of 2017. Market consensus forecasts an overall inflation rate of 1.9% for 2017, while the government anticipates a basic inflation rate of 2.0%. Although heightened uncertainties may affect hiring sentiment, private sector analysts expect the unemployment rate to remain at 3.4% in 2017.\n\n# Uncertainties and Risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2017 will be subject to numerous uncertainties, particularly those stemming from the external environment. The policy uncertainties of the new U.S. administration will cloud the global economic outlook, and potential protectionist measures could also hinder global trade. The Brexit process and elections in several major European countries may also lead to volatility in asset markets and affect the flow of Hong Kong dollars. Furthermore, the normalization of U.S. interest rates will tighten local monetary conditions and exert downward pressure on the real economy and asset prices, with the property market remaining tight and the outlook still uncertain. In the short term, low mortgage rates, stable employment and income conditions, and incentives offered by property developers (such as discounts and cash rebates) releasing accumulated purchasing power, can all support residential demand. On the other hand, the new stamp duty measures, the possibility of the U.S. accelerating its pace of interest rate hikes, and the steady increase in housing supply may continue to pose challenges to the property market.\n\n# Bank performance\n\nDespite facing headwinds, and with market volatility exacerbated by unexpected outcomes of international political events, Hong Kong's banking system remained sound in 2016. Authorized institutions maintained a healthy capital and liquidity position, and while asset quality deteriorated slightly, it remained at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs US interest rates rise, Hong Kong interbank offered rates have increased significantly in November and December. The composite rate, reflecting retail banks' Hong Kong dollar funding costs, has risen slightly (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, Best Lending Rate, and Prime Rate\n\nNote:\n1. The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) (monthly average) is announced by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.\n2. The Best Lending Rate (monthly average) is based on the rate reported by HSBC Holdings plc.\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nRetail banking profitability improved slightly in 2016, with its Hong Kong business recording an 8.7% increase in pre-tax operating profit. Growth was primarily driven by income from foreign exchange and derivatives (+39.7%), dividends received from subsidiaries (+123.5%), and net interest income (+2.8%), although part of this growth was offset by a decrease in fee and commission income (-11.3%). Retail banking profit after tax increased by 44.4%, mainly due to non-recurring items. The retail bank’s average return on assets after tax also rose from 1.04% in 2015 to 1.44% (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Performance of Retail Banks\n\nThe net interest margin of retail banking in 2016 was 1.32%, unchanged from the level in 2015 (Figure 9). Although retail banks continued to allocate excess funds to lower-yielding but more liquid financial investments, the decrease in interest income was offset by a decline in interest expense.\n\nFigure 9: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\n\nNon-interest income accounted for 44.3% of total operating income, remaining relatively stable. While fee and commission income decreased by 11.3%, dividend income and income from foreign exchange and derivatives businesses increased by 123.5% and 39.7%, respectively.\n"}
{"zh":"# 貨幣穩定\n\n儘管外圍環境波動及美元息率上升，港元匯率在2016年仍然保持穩定。香港貨幣市場亦繼續運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。聯繫匯率制度繼續展現高度承受衝擊的能力，是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是維持貨幣穩定，即確保港元匯價穩定，使港元在外匯市場兌美元的匯率保持在7.75至7.85港元兌1美元的區間內。該貨幣體制主要採用貨幣發行局制度，規定由外匯基金所持的美元儲備向貨幣基礎提供最少百分之百的支持；貨幣基礎若有變動，美元儲備亦必須作出相應增減，與貨幣基礎的變動百分之百配合。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 負債證明書（為3間發鈔銀行發行的銀行紙幣提供十足支持）\n- 政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣\n- 銀行在金管局所持結算戶口的結餘總額（即總結餘）\n- 金管局代表政府發行的外匯基金票據及債券。\n\n表1 貨幣基礎\n\n金管局透過自動利率調節機制及履行兌換保證的堅決承諾來維持港元匯率的穩定。若市場對港元的需求大過供應，令市場匯率轉強至7.75港元兌1美元的強方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行沽出港元、買入美元，使總結餘增加及港元利率下跌，從而令港元匯率從強方兌換保證匯率水平回復至7.75到7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供過於求，令市場匯率轉弱至7.85港元兌1美元的弱方兌換保證匯率，金管局會向銀行買入港元，使總結餘減少及推高港元利率，港元匯率隨之由弱方兌換保證匯率水平回復至兌換範圍內。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n港元匯率在2016年首兩個月略有波動後，於年內餘下時間一直窄幅徘徊。港元在2016年初兌美元顯著轉弱，由1月4日的7.7510降至1月20日的7.8196（圖1）。港元匯率轉弱符合聯繫匯率制度的正常運作，反映美國在2015年12月加息後港元與美元的負息差擴濶。此外，其他市場相關因素，包括香港股市出現拋售、內地及香港經濟前景不及以前樂觀、人民幣匯率波動增加，以及亞洲貨幣普遍疲弱，均導致港元需求減弱。受到市場氣氛改善支持，港元匯率在2月略為轉強，並自3月起一直在7.753至7.776之間窄幅徘徊，即使英國脫歐公投及美國總統選舉引發市場波動亦未受影響。由於市場預期美國會在夏季加息，港元匯率於5月出現短暫的轉弱壓力。整體而言，港元外匯市場在2016年一直正常運作。\n\n圖 1 2016年市場匯率\n\n由於兌換保證沒有被觸發，因此總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券總額在2016年沒有明顯變動，大致維持在12,222億港元左右（圖2）。年內金管局增發總值1,320億港元的外匯基金票據，以滿足銀行在流動性管理方面的龐大需求，令總結餘相應減少至2016年底的2,596億港元。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局制度的原則，這是由於增發外匯基金票據只屬貨幣基礎組成部分之間的轉移，即由總結餘移至未償還外匯基金票據及債券，貨幣基礎仍然由外匯儲備提供十足支持。\n\n圖 2 2016年總結餘及未償還外匯基金票據及債券\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港銀行同業拆息在2016年大部分時間維持在較低水平（圖3）。香港銀行同業拆息在1、2月期間因金融市場波動加劇而面對一些上升壓力，但在3月隨着金融環境回復平靜而轉趨穩定。於第2及第3季，儘管市場關注英國脫歐公投結果以及美國貨幣市場基金改革，香港銀行同業拆息仍大致保持穩定。部分受到年底資金需求影響，以及港元拆息追回美元拆息的升幅，香港銀行同業拆息在第4季錄得較大升幅。儘管如此，短期銀行同業拆息在2016年大致維持在低於基本利率的水平。\n\n因應美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於12月14日（美國時間）由0.25至0.50厘上調至0.50至0.75厘，基本利率於12月15日由0.75厘上調至1.00厘。基本利率的調整是按照於2009年3月26日宣布的經修訂計算公式作出。按照該公式，基本利率定於美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下限加50基點的水平，或隔夜與1個月香港銀行同業拆息的5天移動平均數的平均值水平，兩者以較高者為準。\n\n圖 3 2016年香港銀行同業拆息\n\n港元遠期匯率點子在1月出現大幅溢價，大致跟隨港元與美元息差的走勢，以及部分反映投資者為其港股組合作出外匯對沖的需求（圖4）。遠期匯率溢價在2月開始收窄。隨着市況轉趨穩定，港元遠期匯率點子在3至11月期間大致保持穩定，其後在12月因港元與美元息差收窄而再度上升。整體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順，銀行同業流動資金充裕。貼現窗借貸在2016年並不活躍，僅涉及53億港元。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n儘管經歷多次區內以至全球金融危機，聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）過去數十年來一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石。2016年初市場波動加劇，再度引起有關港元轉弱及情況有如亞洲金融危機時期的評論。為增進各界對聯匯制度的認識，金管局向公眾闡釋聯匯制度的技術細節，並指出香港金融體系有能力抵禦衝擊。政府亦重申堅決維持聯匯制度。外匯及貨幣市場穩定，進一步鞏固公眾對政府維持聯匯制度的決心以及港元作為支付及保值貨幣的信心。國際貨幣基金組織在與香港進行年度第四條磋商時，明確表示聯匯制度是最適合香港的貨幣制度，指出香港靈活的經濟結構、充裕的財政及儲備緩衝、以及穩健有效的金融監管是聯匯制度的後盾。\n\n圖 4 2016年美元兌港元遠期匯率點子\n\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作具關鍵作用，金管局繼續密切監察銀行的信用、流動性及利率風險管理以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行個人、企業及內地相關貸款的監管，以確保銀行體系具備應付衝擊的能力。面對美國貨幣政策正常化，香港銀行同業拆息開始上升，金管局提醒市民保持警覺，並作好準備以應付可能出現的市場波動及風險。\n\n為提高貨幣發行局帳目的透明度，自1998年10月起，外匯基金已有部分資產被指定用作支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（即支持資產相對貨幣基礎的比率）於2016年在106.3至107.5%之間的窄幅上落，並無觸及上限或下限。該比率於2016年12月31日為106.7%（圖5）。在聯匯制度下，雖然已指定某些外匯基金資產作為支持組合，但外匯基金的全部資產均可用作支持港元匯率。外匯基金的龐大財政資源，能在面對突如其來的衝擊時為香港貨幣及金融穩定提供強力後盾。\n\n圖5 2016年支持比率每日變動\n\n# 研究工作\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的貨幣發行委員會負責監察和探討與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的課題。在2016年，貨幣發行委員會探討的課題包括香港與中國內地及美國經濟增長同步性、港元貨幣外部需求及香港的金融狀況指數。貨幣發行委員會會議紀錄及金管局向其呈交的貨幣發行局制度運作報告，均載於金管局網站。\n\n香港金融研究中心繼續支持貨幣政策、銀行業及金融範疇的研究工作。在2016年，研究中心合共邀請18位學者到訪，並發表20份工作論文。\n\n年內研究中心舉辦6項國際會議及研討會，主要包括：\n- 於1月舉辦「第7屆中國經濟年度國際研討會」，主題為「中國對全球經濟的影響日益加深」，其間發表8份涵蓋廣泛議題的研究論文，包括中國增長再平衡及增長潛力、來自中國的經濟外溢效應、人民幣對全球及區內的影響，以及人民幣市場之間的利差交易走勢及資訊流動。\n- 於3月與香港科技大學及慶應大學合辦「科技大學與慶應大學及研究中心匯率及宏觀經濟研討會」，內容涵蓋多個不同經濟議題，包括全球經濟失衡、匯率動態變化、資本管制及貨幣政策。\n- 於8月與香港城市大學合辦「房地產與金融穩定研討會」，會上發表的論文內容涵蓋年齡、人口與住屋需求；大額投資者對資產質素的影響；香港房屋價格動態變動；住屋市場負擔能力；按揭規例對家庭生命周期置業決定的影響，以及中國內地的住宅物業市場。\n- 於10月與金管局及國際結算銀行合辦有關亞太區經濟體系的研討會，主題為「在動盪不穩的全球環境下區內經濟體系的抗震能力」。研討會吸引多間央行的高層、主要學者及來自國際組織與私人機構的專家出席，就亞太區經濟體系最迫切的事項進行互動式圓桌討論，交流意見。探討的議題涵蓋廣泛，包括亞洲的金融失衡狀況、資金流、內地經濟放緩對區內其他地方的外溢效應，以及亞洲潛在增長受到的影響及前景。\n\n研究中心亦於8月舉辦「第14屆年度夏季研討會」，並於9月舉辦「第14屆中國內地經濟研討會」，探討內地銀行的資產質素及金融穩定事項。上述會議及研討會吸引學術界、金融服務界及各地央行代表參加。研究中心亦於年內舉辦21場公開小型研討會，探討廣泛的經濟、貨幣及金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣及硬幣\n\n截至2016年底，流通銀行紙幣（指發鈔銀行發行的紙幣）總值4,078億港元，較上年增加13.2%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行的流通紙幣及硬幣總值118億港元，較上年增加5.3%（圖9及10）。在政府發行的紙幣及硬幣中，10港元流通紙幣總值44億港元，當中塑質鈔票佔86%。\n","en":"# Currency Stability\n\nDespite external volatility and rising US interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable in 2016. The Hong Kong money market continued to operate smoothly, with ample liquidity among banks. The linked exchange rate system continued to demonstrate a high capacity to withstand shocks, serving as a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Goals\n\nHong Kong’s primary monetary policy objective is to maintain currency stability, which means ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar. This monetary system primarily employs a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; and when the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must correspondingly increase or decrease, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Deposit (fully backing banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks)\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government\n- The aggregate balance of settlement accounts held by banks with the Financial Regulator (i.e., the total balance)\n- Foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued on behalf of the government by the Financial Regulator.\n\nTable 1: Monetary Base\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automated interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to honoring the exchange rate guarantee. If market demand for the Hong Kong dollar exceeds supply, causing the market exchange rate to strengthen to the stronger end of the guaranteed exchange rate of HK$7.75 per US dollar, the HKMA will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars from banks, increasing the aggregate balance and lowering Hong Kong dollar interest rates, thereby bringing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate back within the HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 exchange rate range. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars exceeds demand, causing the market exchange rate to weaken to the weaker end of the guaranteed exchange rate of HK$7.85 per US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks, decreasing the aggregate balance and pushing up Hong Kong dollar interest rates, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will return to within the exchange rate range.\n\n## 2016 Retrospective\n\n# Exchange rates are stable.\n\nAfter experiencing slight fluctuations in the first two months of 2016, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained within a narrow range for the rest of the year. The Hong Kong dollar weakened noticeably against the US dollar at the beginning of 2016, falling from 7.7510 on January 4th to 7.8196 on January 20th (Figure 1). This weakening of the Hong Kong dollar was consistent with the normal operation of the linked exchange rate system, reflecting the widening negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar following the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike in December 2015. Furthermore, other market-related factors, including selling pressure in the Hong Kong stock market, a less optimistic economic outlook for mainland China and Hong Kong, increased volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate, and general weakness in Asian currencies, all contributed to a decrease in demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Supported by improving market sentiment, the Hong Kong dollar briefly strengthened in February and subsequently fluctuated within a narrow range of 7.753 to 7.776 from March onwards, remaining unaffected even by market volatility triggered by the UK’s Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. Due to market expectations of a US interest rate hike in the summer, the Hong Kong dollar experienced a brief period of downward pressure in May. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market operated normally throughout 2016.\n\nFigure 1: 2016 Market Exchange Rates\n\nAs the exchange fund trigger was not activated, the aggregate balance and the total amount of outstanding foreign exchange fund certificates and bonds remained relatively stable in 2016, around HKD 12,222 billion (Figure 2). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued an additional HKD 132 billion of foreign exchange fund certificates to meet the banking sector’s substantial liquidity management needs, reducing the aggregate balance to HKD 2,596 billion at the end of 2016. The issuance of these foreign exchange fund certificates was consistent with the principles of the Currency Board System, as it involved a transfer within the components of the monetary base – from the aggregate balance to the outstanding foreign exchange fund certificates and bonds – and the monetary base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 2: Summary of End-of-Year Balances and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds (2016)\n\n# Monetary Market\n\nHong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) remained at relatively low levels for most of 2016 (Figure 3). HIBOR faced some upward pressure in January and February due to increased volatility in financial markets, but stabilized in March as the financial environment calmed. Throughout the second and third quarters, despite market concerns regarding the UK’s Brexit referendum and reforms in US money market funds, HIBOR generally remained stable. However, due to year-end funding demand and the rebound of the spread between Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interbank rates, HIBOR recorded a larger increase in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, short-term HIBOR rates were generally below the base rate throughout 2016.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range increase from 0.25% to 0.50% to 0.50% to 0.75% on December 14 (U.S. time), the Base Rate was increased from 0.75% to 1.00% on December 15. The adjustment to the Base Rate was made in accordance with the revised calculation formula announced on March 26, 2009. According to that formula, the Base Rate is set at the higher of either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the U.S. Federal Funds Rate target range or the average of the 5-day moving average of the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR).\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate in 2016\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate quotes saw significant premiums in January, largely tracking the interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar, as well as reflecting some investor hedging demand for their Hong Kong stock portfolio exposure (Figure 4). Forward exchange rate premiums began to narrow in February. As market conditions stabilized, the Hong Kong dollar forward exchange rate quotes remained relatively stable from March to November, before rising again in December due to the narrowing of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate differential. Overall, the Hong Kong monetary market operated smoothly, with ample interbank liquidity. Discount window borrowing was inactive in 2016, involving only HKD 5.3 billion.\n\n# Link exchange rate systems\n\nDespite experiencing multiple regional and global financial crises, the linked exchange rate system (a peg) has served as a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for the past few decades. Increased market volatility in early 2016 once again sparked commentary suggesting a weakening Hong Kong dollar and a situation reminiscent of the Asian financial crisis. To enhance public understanding of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority explained the technical details of the system and pointed out that Hong Kong’s financial system is capable of withstanding shocks. The government also reaffirmed its firm commitment to maintaining the linked exchange rate system. Stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further solidified public confidence in the government’s determination to uphold the system and in the Hong Kong dollar as a currency for payments and store of value. During its annual Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund explicitly stated that the linked exchange rate system is the most suitable monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, noting that Hong Kong’s flexible economic structure, ample fiscal and reserve buffers, and sound and effective financial regulation provide support for the system.\n\nFigure 4: Forward exchange rates of US dollars against Hong Kong dollars (2016)\n\nRecognizing the crucial role of a sound banking system in the smooth operation of the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as the results of their stress tests, and strengthen its supervision of banks' lending to individuals, corporations, and the Mainland. This is to ensure that the banking system is capable of withstanding shocks. In light of the normalization of US monetary policy, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) has begun to rise, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority reminds the public to remain vigilant and prepare for potential market volatility and risks.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the Exchange Fund’s accounts, a portion of the Fund’s assets has been designated to support the monetary base since October 1998. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated within a narrow range of 106.3 to 107.5 percent in 2016, without reaching the upper or lower limits. It stood at 106.7 percent as of December 31, 2016 (Figure 5). Under the linked exchange rate system, while certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as the support portfolio, the Fund’s entire asset base can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources provide a strong safeguard for the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong in the face of sudden shocks.\n\nFigure 5: Daily fluctuations in the support ratio for 2016.\n\n# Research work\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and examining matters relating to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2016, the topics explored by the Currency Board Sub-committee included the synchronicity of economic growth between Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the United States, external demand for the Hong Kong dollar, and the financial condition index of Hong Kong. Minutes of the Currency Board Sub-committee meetings and the Currency Board System of Operation Report submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research continues to support research work in monetary policy, banking, and finance. In 2016, the Institute hosted a total of 18 scholars and published 20 working papers.\n\nWithin the year, the research center hosted six international conferences and seminars, primarily including:\n- The \"7th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy\" in January, with the theme \"China's Growing Influence on the Global Economy.\" The conference featured the presentation of eight research papers covering a wide range of topics, including China’s rebalancing and growth potential, economic spillover effects from China, the impact of the Renminbi on the global and regional economies, and trends and information flows in Renminbi market interest rate differentials.\n- A \"Joint Seminar on Exchange Rates and Macroeconomics between Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Keio University, and the Research Center\" in March, covering various economic issues including global economic imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, capital controls, and monetary policy.\n- A \"Real Estate and Financial Stability Seminar\" co-organized with Hong Kong City University in August, with papers presented covering topics such as age, population, and housing demand; the impact of large investors on asset quality; fluctuations in Hong Kong housing prices; housing market affordability; the impact of mortgage regulations on homeownership decisions throughout the life cycle; and the residential property market in mainland China.\n- A seminar on the economic systems of the Asia-Pacific region, co-organized with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank for International Settlements in October, with the theme \"Resilience of Regional Economic Systems in a Volatile Global Environment.\" The seminar attracted senior officials from various central banks, leading academics, and experts from international organizations and private institutions, who participated in interactive roundtable discussions and exchanged views on the most pressing issues facing the Asia-Pacific economic system. The topics explored were broad, including the state of financial imbalances in Asia, capital flows, the spillover effects of mainland China’s economic slowdown on other parts of the region, and the impact and prospects for Asia’s potential growth.\n\nThe research center also held the \"14th Annual Summer Symposium\" in August and the \"14th Mainland China Economic Symposium\" in September, focusing on the asset quality and financial stability of mainland banks. These conferences and symposia attracted participation from academics, financial services professionals, and representatives from central banks around the world. Throughout the year, the research center also hosted 21 public seminars exploring a wide range of economic, monetary, and financial issues.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\nAs of the end of 2016, the total value of circulating banknotes issued by banks was HKD 407.8 billion, an increase of 13.2% compared to the previous year (Figures 6, 7, and 8). The total value of circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government was HKD 11.8 billion, an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year (Figures 9 and 10). Among the government-issued banknotes and coins, the total value of HKD 10 banknotes was HKD 4.4 billion, of which 86% were polymer banknotes.\n"}
{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管環球市場風險及震盪增加，香港銀行體系在2016年仍維持穩健。金管局在年內加強監管認可機構的風險管治架構，以及信用與流動性風險管理系統的成效。鑑於網絡攻擊日趨頻繁，金管局亦加強監管認可機構的科技風險管理。為貫徹金管局致力打擊金融罪行的目標，認可機構打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施的成效，繼續是金管局的監管重點。在監管認可機構的操守方面，金管局採取實質行動，推動以客為本的企業文化及促進普及金融，和應對海外中小企及初創企業在香港開立及維持銀行帳戶方面遇到的困難。金管局亦加強監管認可機構銷售投資及保險產品的手法，以進一步提升對客戶的保障。\n\n在監管政策方面，金管局就香港實施國際監管及會計標準的準備工作取得重大進展；當中包括穩定資金淨額比率、大額風險承擔限額、國際財務報告準則第9號及《金融機構（處置機制）條例》下的處置框架。\n\n# 2016年回顧\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n金管局在2016年共進行188次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍廣泛，包括認可機構的CAMEL評級、企業管治、業務運作及風險管理。金管局加強與認可機構董事局的聯繫，以強化銀行業的風險管治及企業文化。除與董事局或董事局委員會舉行會議外，亦另行與獨立非執行董事（獨立非執董）會面，就企業文化及風險管治事宜交換意見。金管局亦與認可機構及其外聘審計師舉行三方聯席會議。此外，金管局就認可機構的薪酬制度是否有助促進有效的風險管理進行評估。\n\n在資本充足水平方面，金管局審視認可機構的資本計劃，包括其未來數年的資本目標，以便就2019年全面實施《巴塞爾協定三》緩衝資本作好準備。認可機構的償付能力壓力測試亦因應當前宏觀經濟環境作出改進。金管局又審慎評估各主要零售銀行的恢復計劃，並就需要改善的環節提出意見。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局繼續以專題評估配合定期現場審查，而專題評估主要適用於被評定為較高風險的範疇。這種監管方法讓金管局更有效地調配監管資源，以應對認可機構所面對的各項新增及主要風險。金管局在2016年共進行377次現場審查及專題評估。這些審查與評估的重點仍是信用風險管理與監控，尤其涉及內地相關業務的信用風險；另一個重點是打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集監控措施。金管局又增加對流動性風險、業務操作風險及科技風險管理的現場審查及專題評估次數。年內專項審查小組亦對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查。\n\n表1載有金管局於2016年的監管工作概要。\n\n# 信用風險的監管\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n銀行貸款在2016年增長溫和。未償還貸款總額全年增加6.5%；2015年的增幅則為3.5%（表2）。由於客戶存款的增幅超過銀行貸款的增幅，整體貸存比率由2015年底的70.1%降至2016年底的68.4%。\n\n表 2 貸款及墊款的增長\n\n內地相關貸款總額在2016年底增加7%至35,640億港元（表3），其中包括在香港註冊的銀行設於內地的附屬公司入帳的5,450億港元貸款。\n\n銀行業的資產質素在2016年維持穩健。儘管零售銀行的特定分類貸款比率由2015年底的0.69%微升至2016年底的0.72%，但仍遠低於2000年以來的長期平均水平2.4%。同期，整體銀行業的特定分類貸款比率由0.73%上升至0.85%。年內銀行業的內地相關貸款的資產質素呈相若走勢；同期，零售銀行這些貸款的特定分類貸款比率由0.78%微升至0.82%，整體銀行業的相關比率亦由一年前的0.77%微升至0.80%。\n\n金管局投入大量監管資源，以確保認可機構繼續採用審慎的信貸審批標準，並維持有效的貸款分類及撥備制度。金管局在監管過程中亦特別關注認可機構對中國內地民營企業的風險承擔持續增加，以及為增加收益而投資於債務證券所引起的信用風險。此外，金管局就認可機構分銷高風險投資產品的信用風險管理進行專題評估。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局繼續密切留意認可機構的物業貸款業務。住宅物業價格於2015年9月開始出現調整，但其後於2016年3月再度上升，全年上升8%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數，由2009年9月金管局尚未推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施時的64%，降至2016年12月的51%。新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均供款與入息比率亦由2010年8月首度推出供款與入息比率上限時的41%，降至2016年12月的34%（圖1）。\n\n圖 1 新造住宅物業按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n金管局推出首輪物業貸款逆周期措施前推出供款與入息比率上限\n\n根據金管局於2015年2月推出的第七輪逆周期措施，使用內部評級基準計算法計算信用風險資本要求的認可機構須將15%信用風險加權下限的應用，由新造按揭貸款延伸至整個住宅按揭貸款組合。這項規定於2016年6月生效。\n\n年內有更多地產發展商向物業買家直接提供按揭貸款，其按揭成數往往高於金管局對認可機構實施審慎要求下許可的水平。金管局密切留意有關發展，並定期與認可機構溝通，以評估銀行有否繼續有效管理對地產發展商的風險承擔。此外，土地註冊處應金管局要求，同意向認可機構提供電子提示服務。使用這項服務的認可機構，當有其他按揭文書就其承按的物業交付土地註冊處辦理註冊時，會收到該處發出的電子提示訊息。這項服務將有助應對按揭借款人未有事先獲得承按認可機構同意下，擅自以同一物業借取額外按揭貸款的情況。土地註冊處已於2017年第1季推出電子提示服務。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險的監管\n\n與其他國際金融中心一樣，香港面對的網絡威脅與日俱增。金管局於2016年接到認可機構通報發現未經授權股票交易及試圖入侵其支付系統的個案，並隨即採取行動應對這些攻擊造成的風險。金管局發出電子銀行服務提示，提醒公眾慎防網上股票交易騙案，並建議公眾採取預防措施。金管局又向認可機構發出通告，就進一步加強網上銀行服務監控可採取的保安措施提供指引。有關試圖入侵銀行支付系統的個案，金管局在香港首次發現相關個案時已提醒認可機構留意這類騙案，並在警方協助下說明這類騙案的犯案手法，以及要求認可機構在加強支付操作的監控措施時須顧及有關手法。\n\n為進一步提升銀行體系應對網絡風險的能力，金管局於2016年5月推出網絡防衛計劃。此計劃由三項支柱組成，即網絡防衛評估框架、專業培訓計劃及網絡風險資訊共享平台（詳見「香港的國際金融中心地位」一章「金融科技促進辦公室」部分）。金管局在12月向認可機構發出通告，列載網絡防衛評估框架的實施時間表。\n\n金融科技在銀行業的應用於2016年長足發展，多間認可機構推出新的金融科技產品，其中個人小額支付服務、非接觸式流動支付及生物認證這幾個範疇的發展尤為顯著。金管局在9月推出「金融科技監管沙盒」，讓認可機構能在受控環境中就其金融科技項目先作試行，而無需完全符合金管局的監管規定。有關安排讓認可機構在正式推出金融科技服務前，可及早收集真實數據及用戶意見，以便作出適當修改。截至2016年底，共有6項使用金融科技監管沙盒的申請獲批，有關的新金融科技產品涉及生物認證、證券交易及用於按揭估值的區塊鏈。金管局又在11月上調無需雙重認證的網上銀行個人小額支付服務的交易上限至每個帳戶每日5,000港元，以應付日益增加的簡便個人支付服務需求。\n\n2016年發生多宗與物業相關的騙案，當中涉及騙徒假扮業主，試圖藉申請按揭貸款或出售有關物業謀取利益。雖然這些騙案並不涉及認可機構，但金管局仍與警方及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）緊密合作，就偵測及防止這些騙案在銀行業內發生向認可機構提供指引。年內金管局出版兩期《操作事故通訊》，與業界分享從認可機構發生過的操作事故中汲取的教訓。金管局亦對認可機構的業務操作風險管理制度、詐騙管理方法、信託╱託管業務操作及防範違規或未經授權交易活動的風險管理及監控措施進行現場審查及專題評估。\n\n# 財資業務及流動性風險的監管\n\n2016年發生數宗重大政治事件，引致金融市場在年內多次大幅波動。與此同時，美國利率繼續緩慢地正常化，聯邦公開市場委員會於12月決定調高聯邦基金利率，是全球金融危機以來的第二次。為應對這些政治事件作好準備，金管局與境外監管機構繼續保持緊密聯繫，並評估事件對香港銀行體系的影響，以及要求銀行保持警覺並加強其風險管理以應對不利的市場發展。\n\n在流動性風險管理方面，金管局進行額外的流動性壓力測試，以評估銀行體系應對可能發生的嚴峻壓力情境的能力，並對認可機構作出跟進，以加強其應對能力。金管局在2015年針對利率風險管理進行一輪現場審查後，再進行額外的現場審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理，並要求在監控方面存有不足的認可機構作出糾正。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動\n\n金管局的風險為本打擊洗錢監管包括現場審查及非現場審查（包括就特定事件與認可機構進行的監管聯繫），主要針對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險較高的範疇。審查內容涵蓋認可機構對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險的評估、風險為本方法的落實情況，以及交易監察與制裁合規的制度和程序。金管局的專項監管人員在2016年共進行17次現場審查及30次非現場審查。\n\n在政策發展方面，金管局優先處理某些行業及人士在開立銀行帳戶方面遇到困難的情況，並發出指引與「常見問題」，以釐清若干客戶盡職審查的規定，以及金管局就風險為本方法的監管期望。與此同時，金管局繼續與業內公會緊密合作，發出指引以協助認可機構處理某些範疇的風險，例如貿易相關的洗錢活動。\n","en":"# Banking system stability\n\nDespite increasing global market risks and volatility, Hong Kong's banking system remained sound in 2016. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) strengthened the oversight of risk governance frameworks and the effectiveness of credit and liquidity risk management systems of authorized institutions throughout the year. Recognizing the increasing frequency of cyberattacks, the HKMA also reinforced the supervision of technology risk management at authorized institutions. In line with the HKMA’s commitment to combating financial crime, the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures remained a key regulatory focus. Regarding the conduct of authorized institutions, the HKMA took concrete steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture and expand financial inclusion, and to address the difficulties faced by overseas small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. The HKMA also strengthened its supervision of the sales practices of authorized institutions for investment and insurance products to further enhance customer protection.\n\nRegarding regulatory policies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has made significant progress in preparing for the implementation of international regulatory and accounting standards in Hong Kong, including measures such as the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limit, IFRS 9, and the enforcement framework under the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance.\n\n## 2016 Retrospective\n\n# Regulatory Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted 188 off-site reviews in 2016, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL ratings, corporate governance, business operations, and risk management of licensed institutions. The HKMA strengthened its engagement with the boards of directors of licensed institutions to reinforce risk governance and corporate culture within the banking sector. In addition to meetings with the boards or board committees, the HKMA also met separately with independent non-executive directors to exchange views on corporate culture and risk governance matters. The HKMA also held tripartite meetings with licensed institutions and their external auditors. Furthermore, the HKMA assessed whether the compensation systems of licensed institutions helped promote effective risk management.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority reviews the capital plans of licensed institutions, including their capital targets for the coming years, to ensure they are well-prepared for the full implementation of the Basel III framework in 2019. Licensed institutions’ solvency stress tests have also been improved to reflect the current macroeconomic environment. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also prudently assessed the recovery plans of major retail banks and provided feedback on areas for improvement.\n\nIn addition to on-site inspections, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to complement regular on-site examinations with thematic assessments, which are primarily applied to areas deemed higher risk. This regulatory approach allows the HKMA to more effectively allocate supervisory resources to address the emerging and principal risks faced by licensed institutions. In 2016, the HKMA conducted a total of 377 on-site examinations and thematic assessments. The focus of these examinations and assessments remained on credit risk management and monitoring, particularly concerning credit risks related to mainland-related businesses; another focus was the monitoring of measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic assessments related to liquidity risk management, operational risk management, and technology risk management. During the year, dedicated specialist teams also conducted on-site examinations of licensed institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) related businesses.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the Financial Supervisory Commission's regulatory work in 2016.\n\n# Regulation of Credit Risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending grew moderately in 2016. The total outstanding loan balance increased by 6.5% throughout the year, compared to a 3.5% increase in 2015 (Table 2). As customer deposits grew at a faster pace than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 70.1% at the end of 2015 to 68.4% at the end of 2016.\n\nTable 2: Growth of Loans and Advances\n\nThe total amount of loans related to the mainland increased by 7% to HKD 356.4 billion at the end of 2016 (Table 3), including HKD 54.5 billion in loans recorded for mainland branches of banks registered in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained stable in 2016. While the specific non-performing loan ratio of retail banks increased slightly from 0.69% at the end of 2015 to 0.72% at the end of 2016, it remained significantly below the long-term average of 2.4% since 2000. During the same period, the overall banking sector's specific non-performing loan ratio rose from 0.73% to 0.85%. Throughout the year, the asset quality of loans related to mainland China within the banking sector followed a similar trend; specifically, the specific non-performing loan ratio of these loans within retail banks increased slightly from 0.78% to 0.82%, and the corresponding ratio for the overall banking sector also increased slightly from 0.77% to 0.80% a year earlier.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission has invested significant regulatory resources to ensure that licensed institutions continue to adopt prudent lending standards and maintain effective loan classification and provisioning systems. The Commission also pays particular attention during its supervisory process to the increasing risk exposure of licensed institutions to mainland Chinese private enterprises, as well as the credit risk arising from investments in debt securities to increase returns. Furthermore, the Commission has conducted a dedicated assessment of the credit risk management of licensed institutions in distributing high-risk investment products.\n\n# Property mortgage loan\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the mortgage lending business of licensed institutions. Residential property prices began to adjust in September 2015, but subsequently rose again in March 2016, increasing by 8% for the year. The average loan-to-value ratio for new residential property mortgages decreased from 64% in September 2009, before the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced the first round of counter-cyclical measures for property lending, to 51% in December 2016. The average debt-to-income ratio for new residential property mortgages also fell from 41% in August 2010, when the debt-to-income ratio limit was first introduced, to 34% in December 2016 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Average mortgage loan amount and debt-to-income ratio for newly constructed residential properties.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced debt-to-income ratio limits prior to the launch of the first round of countercyclical measures for property loans.\n\nAccording to the seventh countercyclical measures launched by the Financial Supervisory Administration in February 2015, recognized institutions calculating credit risk capital requirements using internal ratings-based approaches must extend the application of the 15% credit risk weighted lower bound from newly originated mortgages to their entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. This regulation took effect in June 2016.\n\nMore property developers are offering mortgage loans directly to buyers within the year, with mortgage percentages often exceeding the levels permitted under the prudent requirements imposed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on licensed institutions. The HKMA is closely monitoring this development and regularly communicates with licensed institutions to assess whether banks continue to effectively manage their risk exposure to property developers. Furthermore, at the HKMA’s request, the Land Registry has agreed to provide electronic alert services to licensed institutions. Licensed institutions using this service will receive electronic alerts from the Registry when mortgage documents relating to properties they have financed are submitted for registration. This service will help address situations where borrowers obtain additional mortgage loans on the same property without prior consent from their financing institution. The Land Registry launched the electronic alert service in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n# Regulation of Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nLike other international financial centers, Hong Kong faces increasingly prevalent cyber threats. Following reports from licensed institutions in 2016 regarding unauthorized stock trading and attempts to infiltrate their payment systems, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) promptly took action to address the risks posed by these attacks. The HKMA issued an electronic banking service advisory to the public, reminding them to be cautious of online stock trading scams and suggesting preventative measures. Furthermore, the HKMA issued a circular to licensed institutions, providing guidance on security measures to further strengthen monitoring of online banking services. Regarding the attempts to infiltrate bank payment systems, the HKMA had previously alerted licensed institutions to be aware of such scams when the first related case was detected in Hong Kong, and, with police assistance, explained the modus operandi of these scams and advised licensed institutions to consider these methods when strengthening monitoring measures for payment operations.\n\nTo further enhance the resilience of the banking system against cyber risks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Cyber Defence Plan in May 2016. This plan comprises three pillars: a cyber defence assessment framework, a professional training program, and a cyber risk information sharing platform (see the “Financial Technology Promotion Office” section in the chapter “Hong Kong’s Status as an International Financial Centre”). In December, the HKMA issued a circular to licensed institutions outlining the implementation timeline for the cyber defence assessment framework.\n\nThe application of financial technology in the banking sector saw significant advancements in 2016, with several authorized institutions launching new fintech products. Developments in areas such as personal micropayments, contactless mobile payments, and biometric authentication were particularly notable. In September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the \"Fintech Regulatory Sandbox,\" allowing authorized institutions to pilot their fintech projects in a controlled environment without full compliance with HKMA regulations. This arrangement enables institutions to gather real-world data and user feedback before formally launching fintech services, allowing for appropriate adjustments. As of the end of 2016, six applications to use the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox had been approved, covering new fintech products involving biometric authentication, securities trading, and blockchain technology for mortgage valuations. In November, the HKMA also raised the transaction limit for online banking personal micropayment services without dual authentication to HK$5,000 per account per day, to meet the growing demand for convenient personal payment services.\n\nSeveral property-related scams occurred in 2016, in which fraudsters impersonated property owners to obtain benefits through mortgage loan applications or property sales. Although these scams did not involve licensed institutions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) worked closely with the police and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) to provide guidance to licensed institutions on detecting and preventing such scams within the banking sector. During the year, the HKMA published two issues of the \"Operational Incident Bulletin\" to share lessons learned from operational incidents experienced by licensed institutions. The HKMA also conducted on-site reviews and thematic assessments of licensed institutions’ business operational risk management systems, fraud management approaches, operational practices and risk management and monitoring measures to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transactions in trust and custody services.\n\n# Regulation of Financial Resources and Liquidity Risk\n\nSeveral significant political events occurred in 2016, leading to substantial fluctuations in financial markets throughout the year. Concurrently, US interest rates continued their gradual normalization, and the Federal Open Market Committee decided in December to raise the federal funds rate, marking the second increase since the global financial crisis. To prepare for these political events, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintained close contact with overseas regulatory bodies and assessed the impact of these events on the Hong Kong banking system, while also requiring banks to remain vigilant and strengthen their risk management to address adverse market developments.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Authority has conducted additional liquidity stress tests to assess the banking system’s ability to withstand severe stress scenarios and has followed up with licensed institutions to strengthen their resilience. Following a round of on-site reviews on interest rate risk management in 2015, the Authority has conducted further on-site reviews to evaluate the market risk management of licensed institutions and has required those with inadequate monitoring to make corrections.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority's risk-based anti-money laundering supervision includes on-site and off-site examinations (including regulatory engagement with licensed institutions regarding specific incidents), primarily focusing on areas with higher risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. The examinations cover licensed institutions’ assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the implementation of risk-based approaches, and the systems and procedures for transaction monitoring and sanctions compliance.

Last year's tax amendments helped create a favorable environment, attracting multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in the city. To develop Hong Kong into a center for infrastructure financing and a fintech hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office within the year. During the year, the HKMA issued 13 licenses to operators of stored-value facilities. Hong Kong's sound fiscal performance and substantial net external assets continue to be affirmed by credit rating agencies, with Standard & Poor's maintaining its AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# Overview\n\nAffected by fluctuations in global financial markets and uncertainties surrounding the Renminbi exchange rate, offshore RMB business experienced a slowdown in 2016. Nevertheless, Hong Kong maintained its position as a global hub for offshore RMB business, handling approximately 70% of global RMB payment transactions. The \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" trading link, launched in December, marked another milestone in the mainland’s capital account liberalization and an important step in enhancing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened financial infrastructure by expanding its RMB liquidity support for the market and introducing measures to increase the transparency of the RMB market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) in July to promote infrastructure development and establish Hong Kong as a center for infrastructure financing by bringing together key stakeholders. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 organizations had joined IFFO as partners. During the year, the HKMA also successfully pushed for legislative amendments to eliminate tax asymmetries and provide tax incentives, encouraging multinational and mainland companies to set up corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, creating more business opportunities for the financial and professional services sectors. The number of institutional investors with operations in Hong Kong has also been gradually increasing; notably, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of an overseas office in Hong Kong, its only office outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) positively evaluated our efforts to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center during last year’s Article IV consultation discussions. Throughout the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively participated in international discussions, striving to promote global and regional financial stability. The Authority also maintained close communication with international credit rating agencies, and this work helped secure affirmation of Hong Kong’s credit ratings from major rating agencies in 2016.\n\nThe safe and effective operation and continued development of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure play a vital role in reinforcing Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center and a global hub for offshore RMB business. Four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems for interbank transactions and the Central Money Market Unit (CMU) system achieved a 100% system availability rate in 2016, exceeding the target level of 99.95%.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority further strengthened Hong Kong’s retail payment financial infrastructure in 2016. During the year, a total of 13 stored-value facilities licences were issued under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”), which came into full effect in November 2016. The scope of electronic cheque services has also been expanded to include cross-border payments between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen).\n\nTo promote the development of financial technology in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Fintech Facilitation Office in March. Several key measures implemented throughout the year have made significant progress.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Authority has launched a series of measures to strengthen the soft power of the banking sector, including (i) launching a program to enhance the professional capabilities of directors; (ii) establishing a professional qualification framework for banking employees across the industry; and (iii) implementing a consumer education program.\n\n## 2016 Retrospective\n\n# Offshore Renminbi Business\n\nThe volatility of global financial markets and the uncertainty surrounding the Renminbi exchange rate led to a slowdown in offshore Renminbi business. As of year-end, the aggregate balance of Renminbi client deposits and certificates of deposit in Hong Kong totaled RMB 625.1 billion, a decrease of 38% compared to the previous year (Figure 1). The volume of offshore Renminbi bond issuance during the year fell to RMB 52.8 billion, and the amount of Renminbi trade settlement processed by Hong Kong banks also decreased to RMB 454.21 billion. On the other hand, Hong Kong banks’ Renminbi loan balance as of year-end was RMB 294.8 billion, roughly unchanged from the previous year (Figure 2). The transaction volume of the Renminbi Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system remained high, with an average daily transaction volume of RMB 863.6 billion in 2016. This demonstrates that despite a reduction in the Renminbi liquidity pool, it continues to support a significant volume of Renminbi financial intermediation in Hong Kong. According to statistics from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), Hong Kong processed approximately 70% of Renminbi payment transactions in 2016, further solidifying its position as a global offshore Renminbi business hub.\n\nFigure 1: Renminbi Client Deposits and Deposit Certificates\n\nFigure 2: RMB Financing Activities\n\nWithin the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) worked closely with mainland authorities to secure greater policy flexibility and promote Hong Kong's RMB businesses. Several new measures were launched throughout the year, including further expanding the opening of the mainland interbank bond market and foreign exchange market, and the launch of the \"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect\" in December. In response to the increasing demand for cross-border investment channels and liquidity management, the HKMA expanded the RMB liquidity arrangement. In October, the number of banks eligible to provide primary liquidity under the arrangement was increased from seven to nine, and the total amount of the scheme was also increased from RMB 140 billion to RMB 180 billion. The transparency of the HKMA's RMB liquidity arrangement usage was also enhanced, which helps participating banks more effectively manage their liquidity.\n\nThe national \"Thirteenth Five-Year Plan,\" released in March, reaffirmed Hong Kong's position as a global hub for offshore RMB businesses, demonstrating the central government's support for Hong Kong to further develop its offshore RMB business.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to strengthen cooperation with other economies and develop offshore RMB businesses. The Authority also actively participates in various events to promote Hong Kong as a leading offshore RMB hub and a key platform for the Mainland’s “going out” strategy, including involvement in local events organized by industry associations and private organizations, as well as overseas activities in the Mainland, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the United Kingdom.\n\n# Arrangements between the Mainland and Hong Kong on establishing closer economic and trade relations.\n\nAn agreement was signed in 2015 to substantially liberalize trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong under the framework of the \"Arrangement Concerning Hong Kong's Participation in Mainland and Mainland's Participation in Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement.\" The Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to closely monitor the implementation of measures under the existing arrangement and collaborates with government authorities to explore further expansions of Mainland market access and facilitation measures for the Hong Kong financial services sector.\n\n# Office for Infrastructure Financing and Facilitation (IFFO)\n\n# IFFO's mission\n\nIFFO’s mission is to foster infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. IFFO’s functions include:\n- Providing a platform for information exchange and experience sharing;\n- Enhancing skills and knowledge in infrastructure investment and financing;\n- Promoting market and product development;\n- And facilitating infrastructure investment and financing activities.\n\nMr. Chen Der-lin, Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (left seven), toasted with other guests at the IFFO launch ceremony.\n\nThe Financial Services and Development Council established IFFO in July, with the mission of promoting infrastructure investment and financing by bringing together key stakeholders. As of the end of January 2017, over 60 institutions from mainland China, Hong Kong, and overseas had joined IFFO as partners, including multilateral financial institutions and development banks, state-owned investors, private investors, asset management companies, banks, insurance companies, infrastructure project development and operation entities, professional service firms, and international trade associations (Table 1).\n\nIFFO has made significant progress since its establishment. To enhance skills, IFFO co-hosted a workshop in October with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, and China Hony Capital, focusing on \"Investment and Financing in Emerging Market Infrastructure Projects.\" The workshop received very positive feedback from participants and helped expand knowledge and build networks. In November, IFFO also held a high-level seminar featuring Mr. Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, who shared his experience in infrastructure project planning, operation, and management. In July, IFFO signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with both the International Finance Corporation and the Global Infrastructure Center to establish a framework for cooperation. Furthermore, in December, MOUs were signed with the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China to facilitate infrastructure project financing through the IFFO platform. These activities contribute to strengthening Hong Kong's position and international image as a center for infrastructure financing.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Mr. Chen Der-lin (left) and International Finance Corporation Executive Vice President and CEO Mr. Philippe Le Houérou (right) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate cooperation in utilizing the IFC's platform to create a more efficient and favorable market environment for infrastructure investment and financing in the region.\n\nMr. Chen Der-ryen, Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (left), and Mr. Chris Heathcote, CEO of the Global Infrastructure Hub (right), signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic cooperation framework to facilitate infrastructure project financing.\n\nFinancial Supervisory Commission Chairman Chen Der-lin (left) and China Development Bank Chairman Hu Huaibang signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen cooperation between the bank and the FSC.\n\n# Corporate Financial Hub\n\nTo further attract multinational corporations to establish corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority and government authorities are working together to create a favorable tax environment for these centers. Specifically, the Tax (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2016 (the “Amendment Ordinance”) was passed in June, allowing companies to deduct interest expenses on internal financing activities within a business group when calculating profits tax, provided they meet specified conditions. Furthermore, it provides a 50% reduction in profits tax (bringing it down to 8.25%) on the profits of qualifying corporate treasury centers from specified treasury activities. Table 2 summarizes key points of the Amendment Ordinance.\n\nBesides its legislative work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also actively promoted the advantages of establishing corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong to multinational and mainland enterprises. As of the end of the year, the Monetary Authority had engaged with nearly 400 companies, financial institutions, and industry organizations. In November, the Monetary Authority also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Hong Kong China Chamber of Commerce to help Hong Kong’s mainland-invested enterprises better understand and make greater use of our corporate treasury center platform.\n\n# Promoting asset management services\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to promote Hong Kong as an asset management hub. According to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the number of licensed corporations engaged in asset management was 1,300 at the end of 2016, an increase of nearly 15% year-on-year. According to the Asian Venture Capital & Private Equity Journal, the number of private equity firms in Hong Kong (including SFC-licensed corporations and non-SFC-licensed corporations) also increased by 4.6% to 431. To date, nearly 70 of the world’s top 100 asset management companies, as well as most of the mainland’s top 20 mutual fund companies, have established businesses or affiliated companies in Hong Kong. The number of institutional investors with a presence in Hong Kong is also gradually increasing; among them, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s third-largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in October the establishment of its overseas office in Hong Kong, which is the only office the institution has set up outside of Abu Dhabi.\n\n# Introducing the Open-Ended Fund Company Structure\n\nTo attract fund registrations to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to collaborate with the government and industry to create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment. In June, the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016 was passed, introducing the open-ended fund company structure, making Hong Kong’s fund registration platform more diverse and providing fund managers with a more flexible operating environment, thereby strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international asset management center.\n\n# Islamic finance\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to dedicate itself to increasing market awareness and understanding of Islamic finance, including co-organizing and participating in Islamic finance seminars and workshops with industry associations, and sharing experience with market participants regarding the issuance of Islamic bonds, encouraging them to utilize Hong Kong’s platform. Following the successful issuance of the first two tranches of Islamic bonds, the Monetary Authority and the government have worked closely together to launch a third tranche when market conditions are favorable.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2016年是充滿意外和黑天鵝事件的一年，環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。2016年年初市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使環球股市大幅下挫。6月英國脫歐公投和11月美國大選結果亦出人意表。儘管投資環境困難，金管局在過去幾年已採取連串防禦措施，增強外匯基金的抗震能力，因此外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2% 的整體投資回報。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權，並投資於其經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後認為合適的證券或其他資產。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(c) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(d) 在符合上述(a)至(c)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合結構及目標資產分布中反映。\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。這兩個組合整體債券與股票的長線目標分布比率為71比29。以目標貨幣比重計，91%的資產分配予美元及港元，其餘9%分配予其他貨幣。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產分散投資至較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權，以及海外投資物業。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的市值上限為外匯基金累計盈餘的三分之一，但因應部分未來基金投放於長期資產，市值上限還有增加的空間。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，以持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎2，惟未來基金存款則除外。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的表現掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。於2016年底，未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重為80：20。預期截至2018年底，未來基金存款中與長期增長組合掛鈎的部分會逐步增加至約50%。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產分布及戰略性資產分布作基礎。策略性資產分布，即投資基準反映的分布情況，顯示外匯基金為達到投資目標而可以作出的最佳長線資產分布。外匯基金以策略性分布作為指引，對資產進行戰略性分布，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際分布往往會與基準分布（亦即策略性分布）有所偏離，而實際與基準分布之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及戰略性偏離的限度，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產分布。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的限度內選持倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理外匯基金約74%的投資，其中包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分投資組合投資於環球定息市場，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約26%的資產，其中包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產。僱用外聘投資經理的目的，是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資技術為外匯基金投資，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化的投資方式，以及讓內部專業人員汲取市場知識與資訊。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發布的《負責任的擁有權原則》（《原則》）。《原則》屬自願性質，旨在協助投資者釐定如何以最佳方法履行其於香港上市公司的投資的擁有權責任。就外匯基金的管理而言，金管局鼓勵獲委任負責管理香港股票組合的外聘基金經理在管理有關投資時採納《原則》。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n近年金融市場波動極大，凸顯風險管理的重要。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂立嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及法規的遵守情況；另亦採用風險管控工具來評估在正常及極度不利市況下的市場風險。金管局亦進行詳細的投資表現因素分析，務求能最有效地運用內部及外聘投資經理的投資管理技術。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2016年的金融市場\n\n2016年環球金融市場出現大波動和震盪。股票市場方面，1月市場憂慮內地經濟硬着陸及全球增長放緩，促使香港及其他主要股市大幅下挫，直至2月中旬市場才穩定下來。6月英國脫歐公投及11月美國大選結果相繼出人意表，但股市在經歷短暫下挫後迅速收復失地。全年計，環球股市普遍表現理想。\n\n債券市場方面，第1季商品價格進一步下跌加深市場對全球增長放緩及低通脹的憂慮，加上第2季英國脫歐公投帶來的不明朗因素及市場對中央銀行維持寬鬆政策的預期，加大了市場對安全資產的需求，支持政府債市於2016年上半年有不俗表現。其中10年期美國國庫券收益率在7月跌至1.36%的歷史低位。然而，在下半年由於市場對美國加息的預期升溫，尤其在美國總統選舉後，美國國庫券收益率飆升。其他主要政府債券的收益率亦上升，但升幅較小。\n\n貨幣市場方面，美元在2016年繼續走強，美元匯價指數升至14年來的高位。美元持續強勢，是受到美元與其他主要貨幣的利率差距擴大所支持。雖然日圓兌美元於2016年上升約3%，歐元兌美元下跌約3%。在英國脫歐公投結果帶來的不明朗因素持續困擾下，英鎊兌美元於年內亦下跌16%，是自2008年以來的最大跌幅。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2016年的表現。\n\n表1 2016年市場回報\n股市表現按照年內指數價格變動計算。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n儘管金融市場大幅波動，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得681億港元投資收入，包括外地股票收益286億港元、香港股票收益53億港元、債券收益331億港元、外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資收益169億港元，以及非港元資產外匯估值下調158億港元。由於去年美元匯價急升，外匯基金非美元投資轉作港元時無可避免出現外匯估值下調。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得7億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2016年年底，外匯基金的資產總額達36,187億港元。長期增長組合投資的市值總計1,818億港元，當中包括私募股權1,168億港元及房地產650億港元，已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為1,338億港元。\n\n儘管投資環境挑戰不絕，外匯基金在2016年仍錄得2%的投資回報率（不包括策略性資產組合）。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率約為12%。\n\n由於外圍投資環境持續惡化，過去幾年金管局已作出一系列防禦部署，包括縮短債券組合年期、增持現金及大幅減持非美元及非港元資產。我們亦加快多元化投資的步伐，特別是長期增長組合的投資。這些部署大大增強外匯基金的抗震能力。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2016年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2016年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在過去3年的平均回報率為0.9%、過去5年為2.0%、過去10年為2.6%，以及由1994年起為4.8%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n圖 1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2016年）\n\n1. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。\n2. 綜合消費物價指數以2014\/2015年為基期的數列計算。\n\n表2 外匯基金投資回報率：以港元計\n\n1. 2001至2003年的投資回報率以美元計。2. 投資回報率的計算不包括策略性資產組合內的資產。3. 不同年期的平均數以複合年度方式計算。\n\n表3 外匯基金資產於2016年12月31日的貨幣比重（包括遠期交易）\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\n2016 was a year filled with unexpected events and black swan occurrences, resulting in significant volatility and fluctuations in global financial markets. At the beginning of 2016, concerns about a hard landing in mainland China and a slowdown in global growth led to a sharp decline in global stock markets. The Brexit referendum in June and the results of the US presidential election in November were also surprising. Despite the challenging investment environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority had implemented a series of precautionary measures in recent years to strengthen the resilience of the Exchange Fund, allowing it to achieve an overall investment return of 2% in 2016.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Bill, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and also to be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center. The Exchange Fund is controlled by the Financial Secretary, and invests in securities or other assets deemed suitable after consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment Objectives and Portfolio Structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee shall determine the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) Preserving capital;\n(b) Ensuring that the overall monetary base is adequately supported at all times by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(c) Ensuring that liquid funds are sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) Seeking investment returns to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the above objectives (a) to (c), in order to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund is broadly divided into two main portfolios: a reserve portfolio and an investment portfolio. The reserve portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing ample backing for the currency base as stipulated by the monetary authority system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in debt and equity markets of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to safeguard asset value and long-term purchasing power. The overall target allocation ratio of bonds to stocks across both portfolios is 71 to 29. Measured by target currency weighting, 91% of assets are allocated to U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining 9% distributed among other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Monetary Authority has prudently and incrementally diversified a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets into a wider range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland bonds and equities, private equity, and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and mainland bonds and equities are held through investment portfolios, while private equity and real estate investments are held through a long-term growth portfolio. The market capitalization limit of the long-term growth portfolio is one-third of the Exchange Fund’s accumulated surpluses, but there is room for further increases in this limit as future fund allocations are made to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 to hold Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited shares purchased by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to the Portfolio's unique nature, its performance has not been included in the assessment of the Exchange Fund's investment returns.\n\n# Regarding deposits with the foreign exchange fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from the Fiscal Reserves, Government Funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio, except for Future Fund deposits. The interest rates on Future Fund deposits are linked to the performance of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio weighting. As of the end of 2016, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was 80:20. It is expected that by the end of 2018, the portion of Future Fund deposits linked to the long-term growth portfolio will gradually increase to approximately 50%.\n\n# Investment Procedures\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation, which reflects the benchmark distribution, indicates the optimal long-term asset allocation for the Exchange Fund to achieve its investment objectives. Guided by the strategic allocation, the Exchange Fund implements a tactical asset allocation to seek returns exceeding the benchmark. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is termed “tactical deviation.” The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, sets the investment benchmark and the limits for tactical deviation, while the Monetary Authority is authorized to decide on the tactical asset allocation. Portfolio managers can hold positions within the limits of the tactical deviation to profit from short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nStaff in the Financial Stability Division of the Financial Supervisory Agency directly manage approximately 74% of the Exchange Fund’s investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and a portion of the investment portfolio. This portion of the investment portfolio invests in global fixed income markets and executes the Exchange Fund’s macroeconomic risk management strategies through derivative instruments.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Financial Supervisory Commission also hires external investment managers to oversee approximately 26% of the foreign exchange fund's assets, including all listed stock portfolios and other special assets. The purpose of hiring external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment techniques available in the market for the foreign exchange fund's investments, to allow the fund to benefit from diversified investment strategies, and to enable internal professionals to learn from market knowledge and information.\n\nExpenses related to engaging an externally hired investment manager include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding tax, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority supports the Securities and Futures Commission’s publication of the “Principles of Responsible Ownership” (“the Principles”) on March 7, 2016. The Principles are voluntary in nature and aim to assist investors in determining how best to fulfil their ownership responsibilities in their investments in listed companies in Hong Kong. With regard to the management of the Exchange Fund, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages externally appointed fund managers responsible for managing Hong Kong equity portfolios to adopt the Principles when managing such investments.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nRecent volatility in financial markets has highlighted the importance of risk management. The Financial Supervisory Agency has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and closely monitors compliance with these guidelines and regulations. Furthermore, it employs risk management tools to assess market risks under normal and extremely adverse market conditions. The Financial Supervisory Agency also conducts detailed analyses of investment performance factors to ensure the most effective utilization of investment management techniques employed by both internal and external investment managers.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# The Financial Markets of 2016\n\nGlobal financial markets experienced significant volatility and fluctuations in 2016. In terms of the stock market, concerns about a hard landing in mainland China and a slowdown in global growth led to sharp declines in Hong Kong and other major stock markets in January, until the market stabilized around mid-February. The results of the UK’s Brexit referendum in June and the US presidential election in November both defied expectations, but stock markets quickly recovered from brief downturns. Overall, global stock markets performed well throughout the year.\n\nIn the bond market, further declines in commodity prices during the first quarter deepened concerns about slowing global growth and low inflation. Coupled with the uncertainties stemming from the UK’s Brexit referendum in the second quarter and market expectations of continued loose monetary policy by central banks, demand for safe-haven assets increased, supporting a strong performance for government bond markets in the first half of 2016. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to a historic low of 1.36% in July. However, in the second half of the year, expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes intensified, particularly after the U.S. presidential election, causing the yield on U.S. Treasury notes to surge. Yields on other major government bonds also rose, but to a lesser extent.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2016, with the US Dollar Index rising to a 14-year high. The dollar's sustained strength was supported by the widening interest rate differential between the dollar and other major currencies. While the Japanese yen appreciated against the dollar by approximately 3% in 2016, and the euro depreciated against the dollar by about 3%, the British pound fell by 16% against the dollar during the year, its largest decline since 2008, amid ongoing uncertainty following the Brexit referendum.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2016.\n\nTable 1: 2016 Market Returns\nStock market performance is calculated based on year-end index price changes.\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nDespite significant volatility in the financial markets, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HKD 68.1 billion in 2016, including HKD 28.6 billion from overseas equities, HKD 5.3 billion from Hong Kong equities, HKD 33.1 billion from bonds, HKD 16.9 billion from other investments held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries, and a HKD 15.8 billion foreign exchange valuation loss on non-Hong Kong dollar assets. Due to the sharp rise in the US dollar exchange rate last year, a foreign exchange valuation loss was unavoidable when converting non-US dollar investments back to Hong Kong dollars. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 361.87 billion. The market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolio totaled HKD 181.8 billion, including HKD 116.8 billion in private equity and HKD 65 billion in real estate. The total amount committed but not yet drawn for investment was HKD 133.8 billion.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges in the investment environment, the foreign exchange fund achieved a 2% investment return in 2016 (excluding the strategic asset allocation). The long-term growth portfolio has generated an annualized internal rate of return of approximately 12% since commencing investments in 2009.\n\nGiven the continued deterioration of the external investment environment, the Financial Supervisory Commission has implemented a series of defensive measures in recent years, including shortening the maturity of bond portfolios, increasing holdings of cash, and significantly reducing holdings of non-US dollar and non-Hong Kong dollar assets. We have also accelerated the pace of diversifying investments, particularly within our long-term growth portfolio. These measures have significantly enhanced the resilience of the foreign exchange fund.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2016. Table 2 displays the Exchange Fund’s investment return rates in 2016 and its average investment return rates for different time periods. The Exchange Fund’s average return rates over the past 3 years were 0.9%, 2.0% over the past 5 years, 2.6% over the past 10 years, and 4.8% from 1994 onwards.

During the year, the HKMA continued to strengthen its corporate governance, including promoting employee professional development, strictly controlling finances, and reinforcing information technology security, to meet the challenges posed by the implementation of new measures and the increasing workload.\n\n# Maintaining Connections with the Public for Organizational Development\n\n# Public Announcement\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains close contact with the media to enhance its transparency and improve public understanding of its policies and work. In 2016, the HKMA held a total of 81 public media events, including 14 press conferences, 13 site visits, and 54 other public events, and arranged 30 media interviews. During the year, 326 bilingual press releases were issued, and a large number of media inquiries were handled daily.\n\nWithin the year, the Financial Supervisory Commission established two important offices: the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) and the Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO). To explain the functions and work plans of the two offices, the FSC conducted various public outreach efforts. In addition, the FSC held press briefings and seminars to deepen public understanding of its operations and measures in multiple areas, including financial inclusion, reserve management, the fintech regulatory sandbox, cybersecurity, and SME financing.\n\nMr. Norman Chan, CEO of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, met with reporters during the Hong Kong Association of Banks’ annual trip to Beijing in December 2016.\n\n# Public Inquiries\n\nThe public enquiry service is an effective channel for citizens to obtain information about the functions and work of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. This service handled 10,170 enquiries in 2016, an increase of 12% compared to 2015. Approximately half of the enquiries concerned banking policy and regulations, monetary and economic matters, and consumer issues related to banks, particularly banking products and services, the coin collection scheme, guidance and circulars related to the banking sector, stored-value facilities and retail payment systems, combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and prudential regulatory measures for mortgage loans.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of public inquiries received each year since 2013, and Figure 2 lists the proportion of different types of inquiries in 2016.\n\n# Publication\n\nBesides the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the “Semi-Annual Report on Monetary and Financial Stability” and four “Quarterly Reports” during the year, and regularly updated the data in the “Monthly Financial Statistics Report,” providing the latest and in-depth information and analysis on Hong Kong’s currency, banking sector, and economic affairs. In addition, the HKMA published a total of 32 “滙思” (Hui Si) articles in 2016, a significant increase from 14 in 2015, elaborating on various specialized topics related to the HKMA’s work.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2015 Annual Report won a Silver Award in the “Non-profit and Charitable Organizations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2016 Best Annual Report Selection.\n\n# Public Education Program\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Phase 2 of the International Finance Centre, introduces the work of the HKMA to the public and enhances public understanding of monetary and banking matters. The Centre comprises an exhibition hall and a library, both open to the public six days a week. The exhibition hall showcases the HKMA’s functions and the development of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking industries, and also provides reading materials and exhibits for research on Hong Kong’s currency, banking, and financial affairs.\n\nThe Financial Services and Treasury Bureau’s policy exhibition area, which explains its work and provides financial knowledge, underwent renovations in the fourth quarter of 2016 to enrich the exhibition content and incorporate various interactive elements. Notably, interactive games were added to make learning fun, clearly explaining financial concepts. Touchscreen displays with images and text provide a more comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the bureau’s work, aiming to offer visitors a brand new experience. In addition, the renovated information center features a mosaic artwork depicting Victoria Harbour, created from over 130,000 Hong Kong coins. The newly revamped policy exhibition area reopened to the public on February 24, 2017.\n\n# Financial Services and Treasury Bureau Website\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s institutional website (www.hkma.gov.hk) provides over 50,000 pages of information in English and both traditional and simplified Chinese, facilitating public access to the latest HKMA information. The website also includes the “Register of Securities Employees of Licensed Corporations” and the “Register of Licensed Corporations and Local Representatives’ Offices,” maintained in accordance with Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the “Register of Stored Value Facilities Licence Holders,” maintained in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The website features dedicated topic pages and prominent quick links to remind the public of HKMA’s new measures, such as the regulatory regime for stored value facilities, IFFO and FFO, and important and timely matters, including precautions against telephone scams and the locations of coin collection vehicles.\n\nA fresh look for the Information Center's policy exhibition area.\n\nA mosaic depicting the Hong Kong harbor skyline, constructed from Hong Kong currency.\n\nThe information center provides guided tours for visitors. Within the year, the center received over 56,200 visitors and provided guided tours for schools and other groups more than 580 times (Figure 3). Since its opening in December 2003, the information center has welcomed a cumulative total of over 586,600 visitors.\n\nThe library, located adjacent to the Exhibition Hall, holds over 23,000 books, journals, and other publications for in-depth research on topics such as Hong Kong currency, banking, finance, and central banking. The library also maintains the electronic record registers of authorized institutions and local representative offices, as well as the electronic record registers of securities employees of authorized institutions, as stipulated in Section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo maintain close ties with the community and enhance public understanding of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work, the HKMA continues to host public education seminars. In 2016, the HKMA held three public seminars, attracting over 1,750 secondary school students and teachers. The topics covered included the linked exchange rate system, the stability of the banking system, Hong Kong banknotes, smart tips for using banking products and services, and the Deposit Insurance Scheme. Since their launch in 1998, these educational seminars have been attended by over 56,400 members of the public.\n\nStudents and teachers from schools in various districts attended one of the public education lectures.\n\nFigure 3: Group categories visiting the information center in 2016\n\n# Human Resources\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority employs, trains, and retains a professional and excellent workforce to achieve policy objectives and adapt flexibly to changes in work priorities. While part of the government structure, the HKMA hires staff under non-civil service terms, attracting talent with appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. As a public organization, the HKMA is committed to maintaining a lean and flexible organizational structure and, wherever possible, implements new measures and handles increasing workloads through redeployment of existing staff.\n\n# Hand-crafted\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission’s staffing level was 875 at the beginning of 2016. Twelve positions were added in the second half of the year to fulfill the Commission’s supervisory functions under the new insurance industry regulatory framework. Consequently, the staffing level at the end of 2016 was 887.\n\nTo ensure sufficient resources for implementing new regulations and policies, continuing ongoing pilot projects, and handling increasingly heavy and complex existing work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s overall staffing increased by 40 to 927 in 2017 (a 4.5% increase). The new positions are responsible for performing the following functions:\n- Promoting the stability of banks and the financial system, including:\n    - Strengthening supervisory capabilities to manage banks’ growing technology risks and new fintech initiatives, as well as to address banks’ expansion within the region and in their business operations;\n    - Enhancing regulatory and enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and preparing for the 2018 Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation assessment;\n    - Planning and preparing for the implementation of the Banking (Resolution) Ordinance to address “too big to fail” issues in the financial sector in accordance with international standards; and\n    - Strengthening supervisory capabilities to align with new international standards on capital and market risk, and allocating additional resources to handle consumer protection matters and bank complaints.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management, and other related support in response to increased investment work involved in further promoting diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, while also reinforcing strategic asset allocation and investment procedures to address an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n- Developing and implementing talent development programs, and strengthening related resources, to ensure the HKMA has the necessary human resources to meet market developments and future challenges.\n- Strengthening research on monetary policy and processing monetary statistics, as well as providing resources to handle inquiries and complaints arising from the licensing\/designation of stored-value facilities and retail payment systems and related regulatory matters.\n\nTable 1 lists the staffing structure and actual number of employees at the Financial Supervisory Commission by department.\nTable 1: Staffing structure and actual number of employees at the Financial Supervisory Commission as of January 1, 2017.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) allocates temporary resources to handle other tasks and second employees to international or local organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Development Council, to provide assistance for work or policies in which Hong Kong or the HKMA is involved. In addition, the HKMA assigns staff to the Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Financial Services & the Treasury Bureau to provide full-time or supportive operational assistance.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits Policy and Salary Review Mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary has consulted the Investment Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee and, with reference to market compensation levels and practices, determined the salaries and terms of service for Hong Kong Monetary Authority employees. The compensation package includes cash compensation and mandatory provident fund contributions, along with a range of basic benefits. Cash compensation comprises a monthly fixed salary (basic salary) and an annual lump-sum bonus based on employee performance.\n\nThe Financial Secretary reviews the salaries of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) employees annually, seeking recommendations from the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, which in turn considers the recommendations of its own governing committee. This review also takes into account the governing committee’s assessment of the HKMA’s performance over the past year, the results of a compensation survey of the financial sector conducted by an independent human resources consultancy, and other relevant factors. The salaries of individual employees with exceptional performance may also be adjusted to maintain their competitiveness.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority allocates funds approved for adjusting annual fixed salaries or distributing performance-based bonuses based on individual employee performance. The performance-based bonus system for professional investment personnel is designed to strengthen the link between investment performance and compensation. Adjustments to fixed salaries or the distribution of performance-based bonuses for assistant vice presidents and above require approval from the Financial Secretary, after considering the views of the governing committee, and the relevant employees will recuse themselves from discussions regarding their compensation. For employees at the managerial level and below, adjustments to fixed salaries or the distribution of performance-based bonuses are determined by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, based on the Financial Secretary’s delegated authority, and according to the entire approved fund allocated for salary payments.\n\n# Executive Compensation\n\nTable 2 lists the compensation data for senior management in 2016.\n\nBesides accrued annual leave, the actual compensation for employees with less than one year of service will be calculated on an annual basis to determine the average annual salary for their respective grades. The employee headcount listed in this table includes employees with less than one year of service. The number of Senior Vice Presidents includes the President of Hong Kong Mortgage Securities Limited. Other benefits include Mandatory Provident Fund, medical and life insurance, and accrued annual leave. These benefits may vary depending on the individual senior executive’s terms of service.\n"}

（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2016年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 審計署署長報告（續）\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n我在審計中如何處理有關事項\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及36.1。\n\n於2016年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共31,989.75億港元，金融負債共9,639.77億港元。\n\n95%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘5%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共1,758.86億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金 融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 未來基金存款\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.6、2.16.1、4(b)、23及28。\n\n在以往年度，財政儲備的絕大部分存款均須於要求時償還，並按每年參考投資組合過去的投資回報釐定的固定息率計算利息。\n\n政府於2016年1月1日在財政儲備內設立未來基金。未來基金存款包含來自土地基金結餘的首筆資金（為數2,197.30億港元），以及從政府一般收入帳目轉撥的恆常注資（金額由財政司司長指示）。未來基金存款的利息按綜合息率計算，而該綜合息率是參考上文提及與投資組合的表現掛鈎的固定息率及與長期增長組合（持有私募股權及房地產投資）的表現掛鈎的年度回報率，每年在加權平均基礎上釐定。除財政司司長另有指示外，未來基金的存款連同所賺取的利息應在2025年12月31日償還。\n\n於2016年12月31日，未來基金的存款共2,245.30億港元。有關存款的累計利息為100.71億港元。由於涉及數額龐大及存款條件有重大改變，需要格外關注有關存款及所賺取的利息的計量、列報方式及披露資料。\n\n就未來基金存款，審計程序包括：\n- 評價計量有關存款及所賺取的利息所用的會計政策是否恰當；\n- 審視與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率的計算方法；\n- 核實參考投資組合以往的表現釐定的固定息率、與長期增長組合的表現掛鈎的年度回報率及參考該兩項息率釐定的綜合息率的計算；\n- 核實以綜合息率計算的應計利息數額；及\n- 審視有關存款及所賺取的利息在財務報表中的列報方式及披露資料。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.12、17及18。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2016年12月31日共值227.23億港元。集團亦於3間聯營公司及14間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值320.83億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2016年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而公平的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制，使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力， 以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否公允反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n","en":"# Exchange Fund\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n\n# Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau\n\n# Report of the Independent Auditor to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nWe hereby certify that we have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiary companies (the \"Group\") set out on pages 149 to 237, which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2016, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of the principal accounting policies.\n\nI am of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2016, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in compliance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Bill (Chapter 66).\n\n# The Foundation of Opinions\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Bill and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities, as determined by those standards, are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Responsibilities of the Auditor for the Audit of the Financial Statements. In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, according to my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements as of December 31, 2016. These matters were addressed in forming my opinion on the overall financial statements, and I will not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Report of the Auditor General (Continued)\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nHow should I handle related matters during an audit?\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nPlease refer to financial statement notes 2.5, 2.6, and 36.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Group’s financial assets carried at fair value amounted to HKD 319.8975 billion, and financial liabilities amounted to HKD 96.3977 billion.\n\n95% of the fair values of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 parameters) or are estimated using valuation techniques that rely on observable market data (Level 2 parameters).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 5% of these financial assets is estimated using valuation techniques, and the parameters used are not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets total HKD 175.88 billion, primarily consisting of unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amounts involved and the need for estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities recognized at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluating and testing the effectiveness of monitoring measures, including those related to computer system applications;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when using market quotations;\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of the related assumptions, and verifying the parameters against independent sources, if the valuation method’s parameters are based on observable market data; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of the related assumptions and parameters, if the valuation method’s parameters are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Future Fund Deposits\n\nPlease refer to financial statement notes 2.6, 2.16.1, 4(b), 23, and 28.\n\nIn previous years, the vast majority of the fiscal reserve’s deposits were required to be repaid upon demand and bore interest calculated at a fixed rate determined annually based on the past investment returns of the reference investment portfolio.\n\nThe government established the Future Fund within its fiscal reserves on January 1, 2016. The Future Fund’s deposits include an initial capital injection of HKD 219.73 billion from the Land Fund surplus, as well as recurrent contributions transferred from the government’s general revenue account (the amount to be determined by the Financial Secretary). Interest on the Future Fund’s deposits is calculated based on a composite rate, which references a fixed rate linked to the performance of the investment portfolio and an annual return linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio (holding private equity and real estate investments), determined on a weighted average basis each year. Unless otherwise directed by the Financial Secretary, the deposits of the Future Fund, together with the interest earned, are to be repaid by December 31, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, Future Fund’s deposits totaled HKD 224.53 billion. The accumulated interest on these deposits amounted to HKD 10.07 billion. Due to the substantial amount involved and significant changes in the deposit conditions, careful attention is required regarding the measurement, presentation, and disclosure of these deposits and the interest earned.\n\nRegarding future fund deposits, the audit procedures include:\n- Evaluating whether the accounting policies used for valuing the deposits and the interest earned are appropriate;\n- Reviewing the calculation method for the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio;\n- Verifying the calculation of the fixed interest rate determined by reference to the historical performance of the reference portfolio, the annual return rate linked to the performance of the long-term growth portfolio, and the blended interest rate determined by reference to the two rates;\n- Verifying the amount of accrued interest calculated using the blended interest rate; and\n- Reviewing the presentation and disclosure of the deposits and the interest earned in the financial statements.\n\n# Valuation of investment property measured at fair value\n\nPlease refer to financial statement notes 2.12, 17, and 18.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 227.23 billion as of December 31, 2016. The Group also holds interests in three associate companies and fourteen jointly controlled entities, whose principal business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with these interests valued at a total of HKD 320.83 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group, or by associates or jointly controlled entities, are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional appraisers. These valuations involve significant judgment and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures for investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuer; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters used.\n\n# Other materials\n\nFinancial management officers are responsible for other data. This data includes all information contained in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2016 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other materials, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on those other materials.\n\nWith regard to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other documents and consider whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with what I became aware of during the audit, or appear to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other documents contain material misstatements, I am required to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Officer and Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with regard to financial statements.\n\nFinancial management professionals are responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Bill, and for implementing internal controls as they deem necessary to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial management professionals are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern and, where applicable, disclosing matters related to the going concern assumption, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The responsibilities of an auditor in relation to the audit of financial statements.\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the overall financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, and to issue an audit report including my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Auditing Standards will detect all material misstatements. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if they could individually or in aggregate influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nThroughout the audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to those risks; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence upon which to base my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls;\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by management and the reasonableness of their accounting estimates and related disclosures;\n- Determine whether management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there are material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that material uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements. If the related disclosures are inadequate, I will issue a qualified audit report. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the auditor’s report date. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern;\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and matters; and\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeline of the planned audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.\n"}
