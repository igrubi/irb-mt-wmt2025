{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over

行政長官聲明\n\n二零二一年是同時進行整固與發展的一年。\n\n在2021年，疫情踏入第二年，未曾減緩：全球供應鏈受到干擾，通膨壓力上升，全球金融條件過早收緊的風險上升。加上COVID-19變異株出現以及地緣政治緊張關係升溫，更增加了不確定性。儘管如此，我們繼續保障貨幣與金融穩定，並維持營運韌性。\n\n2021年亦帶來了復甦的希望，受惠於COVID-19疫苗的成功推出，以及多個經濟體推出的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。 全球經濟開始恢復自2020年的嚴重收縮。 本地，在經歷了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮後，香港經濟在2021年增長了6.3%， благодаря推出疫苗接種計劃和政府的疫情紓困措施，這些措施提供至關重要的支持，以促進我們的經濟復甦。\n\n在金融和貨幣穩定維持，以及宏觀環境穩定的情況下，2021 年為我們提供了發展工作的空間。我們把握機會，積極推進發展的舉措，以協助我們的金融界維持高度的競爭力。在我們的三大戰略重點上，取得了顯著的進展，即金融科技、綠色金融以及香港作為橋樑所產生的內地市場機會。\n\n隨著我們踏入2022年，全球環境有轉變，變得惡化。但有云，當艱難時，勇者愈發勇猛。我們將繼續採取主動，追求我們的發展的目標和優先事項，以更好地應對下一步的挑戰，鞏固我們作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅定不移地承諾確保香港貨幣和金融系統的健全，正如我們過去應對很多挑戰。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基礎。\n\n自1983年設立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港金融體系的強大支柱，有助香港抵禦無數的挑戰和挑戰。儘管COVID-19疫情造成的持續不確定性以及市場對美國貨幣政策收緊步伐的憂慮，港幣匯率和貨幣市場全年在有序方式下繼續職能，反映了聯繫匯率的穩健。\n\n這對我們系統的信心並非一朝一夕形成的，而是以穩健的基礎建立起來的，這基礎經過多年的積累。在2021年的《外部部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，LERS的可信度已透過一套透明的規定、充裕的財政和外匯儲備、強健的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟以及謹慎的財政框架而得到保障。\n\n信心亦是我們在公共領域和市場溝通方面的努力，以及有效監控的結果。在後者方面，我們借助科技和數據分析來加強我們在金融穩定和宏觀審慎監控方面進行更及時和全面的分析能力。\n\n香港銀行體系的穩健至關重要，對金融穩定具有重要作用。 儘管 COVID-19 疫情持續兩年，我們的銀行仍然表現良好，流動性狀況和資本化水平均遠高於國際標準。 截至 2021 年底，本地銀行資本充足率高達 20.2%，遠高於 8% 的最低法定要求，而大型銀行的平均流動性保障率在 2021 年第四季度亦高達 151.9%，同樣遠高於 100% 的法定最低要求。 隨着疫情期間充滿挑戰的信貸環境，本行體系的資產品質在當年大致保持穩定。 截至 2021 年底，該行業的不良貸款比率為 0.88%，較 2020 年底的 0.90% 下降，遠低於自 2000 年以來 1.8% 的長期歷史平均水平。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟的支柱。\n\n一如既往，銀行業是支持經濟活動的重要支柱。鑑於新冠肺炎爆發所帶來的經濟後果，這更是至關重要。過去一年，主要挑戰是 във 管理銀行業的信貸風險，同時維持該行業對實際經濟的支持。憑藉我們多年來的監管工作，銀行持續有效管理信貸風險。與此同時，我們一同與銀行合作，透過預批本金償還寬限計劃（PPPHS）及其他寬限措施，向企業及個人客戶提供所需的支持。PPPHS於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制一同推出，讓合資格的企業客戶可於批核的前提下延後貸款本金償還6個月，並於2021年兩度延長，直至2022年4月，部分由於某些經濟領域仍經營環境艱難，需要持續的信貸寬限。其後，鑑於本地冠狀病毒感染的反彈，於2022年2月，PPPHS進一步延長至2022年10月底。鼓勵銀行攜手香港金管局協助減輕企業及個人借款人的資金周轉壓力，即使該行業本身正因疫情爆發而經歷自身的艱難營運狀況。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境外，疫情亦帶來了更具挑戰性的營運環境，以及隨着網絡威脅持續增加的 цифровй 景觀。我們加強了提升銀行業營運及網絡韌性，以及消費者和投資者保護的努力，隨着 цифровй 化不斷增加和網絡釣魚詐騙急升的趨勢。特別是，《銀行業做法守則》已修訂，以提升 цифровй 金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n此外，我們致力於推動金融普惠和以客戶為中心的文化於銀行業。增強客戶需要銀行服務的方便使用一直是我們的工作重點範疇，我們與業界緊密合作，制訂行業指引。 鑒於關於無障礙銀行服務和向智力障礙人士提供銀行服務的指引，在香港金管局的支持下，業界於12月2021年發出了一份指引，以確立銀行業向患有失智症人士和需要客戶提供銀行服務的原則和良好做法。\n\n為支持香港銀行業在未來持續發展，新發展機遇和挑戰需要勞動力具備一套新技能，金管局已制定一項全面的人才發展策略——「聯繫人才與未來」，以更系統和專項的方式培育未來人才，並提升現任從業者的技能。我們的策略建立於三個「聯繫」方向：聯繫學生與銀行業、聯繫從業員與銀行業的未來，以及聯繫主要持份者一同，以提升實施策略的協作。我們推出了一連串的宣傳和推廣活動，以吸引更多學生進入銀行業。為更好地準備大學生，使他們「準備就緒」，我們聯同香港銀行同業公會，共同推出「未來銀行過渡課程」項目，該項目包括一系列涵蓋實用銀行知識和銀行業高度需求之軟技能的課程。對於現任銀行從業員，我們一直緊密與業界合作，發展提升技能的機會，提供更多市場需要的培訓課程。於2021年12月，加強銀行從業員能力框架下的新金融科技模組正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心之未來發展至關重要。我們將與各持份者方面加強合作，鑑於進一步發展業界的人才儲備。\n\n# 國際金融中心：強勢地位，得益於無可比擬的機會。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心之競爭力，支撐於其提供之無可比擬的機會。普遍有共識認為，全球金融科技的採用、中國大陸金融市場的開放，以及綠色和可持續金融的主流化，為香港金融業的未來發展提供巨大機會。 在香港金融管理局，我們致力於利用香港獨特的優勢來把握這些機會。 讓我首先介紹金融科技和中國大陸市場的機會。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情已清楚地顯示了金融科技的潛力，並永久性地改變了消費者在金融服務方面的行為。為了使我們能繼續暫停終止權在國際金融科技領域的領先地位，並準備就緒以挖掘金融科技的所有潛力，我們必須構建一個生態系統，讓金融科技的價值橫跨各層面，並由所有人體驗。\n\n這個願景由於促使我們制定了《新金融科技2025》新策略，於2021年6月揭曉。正如其名稱所示，該策略旨在協助金融界全面應用科技，目標是到2025年實現。該策略包括五個重點範疇，涵蓋爭取成功生態系統所需要素，亦涵蓋生態系統在生生不息循環中進一步增長所需的因素。策略的首個兩部分，即「所有銀行進行金融科技」和「加深研究香港以適應中央銀行數位貨幣（CBDCs）」，主要旨在創造更多金融科技應用需求。策略的其他部分有關數據、基礎設施、人才和資金，這些對於生態系統的增長至關重要。\n\n根據此策略，推出了一系列新舉措，例如允許金融機構和科技公司進行測試，並從監管機構和用戶那裡盡早獲得回饋的粵港澳大灣區（GBA）金融科技測試設施，以及商業數據交換的測試推出，該交換利用替代數據的使用來促進中小企業融資。我們亦加強了對批發央行數字貨幣（CBDC）在跨境支付中的應用研究，並探索了電子香港元的前景，這將上升香港在採納央行數字貨幣的準備程度，並轉變我們城市在未來幾十年內的金融基礎設施。\n\n在我們把握科技發展帶來的新機會的同時，我們亦會繼續鞏固現有的成果，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，於2018年推出的快速支付系統（FPS），多年來已迅速發展，截至2021年底，註冊數目已達到960萬，按年上升40%。每日平均成交額亦上升九成，由2020年的數目，增至2021年的約673,000宗即時交易。另一方面，鑑於加密資產，尤其用作支付用途的穩定幣的迅速發展，我們今年較早前已發布一份討論文件，邀請市場回饋，就制定合適的監管框架進行討論。\n\n我們的全新、具有前瞻性的策略將建立起有利於金融科技生態系統健康發展的基礎。 隨著銀行業日益採納金融科技以把握其提供的機會，最終將使金融機構和香港人民都受益，同時加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為進入中國內地的主要樞紐。\n\n香港一如既往地在連接內地市場與國際金融市場方面發揮著戰略作用，向國際投資者提供熟悉且多樣的金融、投資和財富管理活動的平台。國家十四五規劃強化了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。 加上全球經濟趨勢，這強化了我們的信心，相信香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場的獨特價值。\n\n在2021年，我們達到了一個里程碑，在提升聯繫方面，加上了兩項新成員，即廣大灣區跨境財富管理聯繫（跨境財富管理聯繫）計劃，以及債券通下的南向交易，本質上完善了在廣泛的金融市場範疇內，包括股票、債務和財富管理等各方面的兩向互通的循環。 兩項計劃的推出將帶來香港在各種方面的新機會。通過滿足日益增加的內地投資者對多元化的需要，這兩項計劃將擴大我們債券市場和財富管理行業的客戶群。 我高興地見到這兩項計劃一直順利運作。 香港金管局將繼續與內地主管部門保持聯繫，以提升這些計劃，並在有時繼續完善它們。\n"}

摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在2021年，香港經濟在強勁的商品出口、回升的本地需求以及政府支持性措施的推動下，回復正成長。勞工市場亦改善，而通脹保持溫和，雖然略有微升。\n\n香港的銀行業保持穩定，擁有良好且充沛的資本和流動性。資產品質在歷史和國際標準下均維持健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港的美元市場繼續以暢順且有序的方式運作，儘管持續的疫情造成的影響以及市場對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮。聯繫匯率制度繼續良好運作。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n隨著全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑，投資基金錄得投資收益1,919十億港元，相當於4.1%的投資回報。\n\n香港金管局繼續致力於支持責任投資和資產多元化。長期增長投資組合自2009年成立以來，錄得年化內部報酬率15.4%。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n金管局持續重點放在對銀行風險管理之監督。鑑於網絡安全威脅持續增加，數碼化亦在加快發展，金管局已加強對銀行營運及網絡韌性之監督。銀行業慣例守則亦已修訂，以提升數字金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n經過廣泛諮詢，粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理互聯互通試驗計劃順利推出。香港金管局向銀行提供指引，按照良好的客戶體驗的方式，透過非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並提供保障。\n\n在打擊洗錢和反恐融資（AML\/CFT）方面，香港金管局的工作重點是進一步加強銀行防止和偵測疫情期間因網絡金融犯罪上升而出現的非法資金流動的能力。香港金管局亦深化了透過公私合作夥伴關係的信息分享，同時支持遠程客戶開戶，並鼓勵採用包括網絡分析在內的各項科技，透過推出首個AML Regtech實驗室來實現。\n\n軟實力基礎設施的建設將會持續推進，包括在銀行文化和人才發展範疇。\n\n實施國際監管標準本地化取得良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露等方面的要求。香港金管局亦推進其在制定解決方案標準、進行解決方案規劃及發展解決方案執行能力方面的工作，以確保銀行擁有具公信力的解決方案體系。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n金管局公布了「金融科技2025」策略，旨在推動金融界對金融科技的廣泛應用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。在快速支付系統方面，其註冊量和交易額已顯著發展，應用層面繼續擴大。\n\n在增強聯繫方面，跨境 WMC 以及債券通下的南向交易已推出，進一步鞏固香港作為離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色。\n\n致力於締造新商機，以加強香港金融平台的競爭力，亦有努力，包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心，以及綠色和可持續金融的範疇。\n\n為推動香港的金融服務，香港金融管理局加強向各持份者進行市場外展，讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所呈現的機遇。香港金融學院亦推出新金融領袖培育計劃，旨在培育香港未來的金融領袖。\n\n#

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated

2022年及前瞻的優先事項\n\n鑑於全球及本地情況於進入2022年時明顯惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級以及美國聯邦儲備局加息的預期觸發了市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟因COVID-19新一波疫情而遭受衝擊。儘管如此，香港的金融體系由於其韌性及多年來建立的緩衝，仍然保持良好地有能力抵禦不利的震盪。展望未來，香港金管局會繼續對維護貨幣及金融穩定性予以重要。為此，我們將努力保持領先地位，通過識別新興風險並以靈活應變的方式回應這些風險。與此同時，香港金管局將尋求有助於鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心地位的機會。在管理投資基金於這個複雜的投資環境中，香港金管局會繼續審慎投資，同時保持靈活，實施合適的防禦措施，並維持高程度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性與完整性\n\n全球經濟前景 保持 受制於 重大不確定因素。香港金管局將密切關注 最新 動態，並 暫停終止權 對潛力 風險保持警惕，旨在維護金融體系的韌性和穩定性，而這對於持續提供支持 香港 經濟 運作 的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持警惕，對抗潛力風險。\n\n展望未來，市場可能受制於各種範疇內的不確定性增加而出現波動加劇。一方面，美國聯邦儲備局的貨幣政策正常化，如果繼續以快速的步伐推進，可能在提早顯著收緊全球金融狀況，並增加全球債務償付負擔。另一方面，鑑於2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級，包括中國與美國的緊張關係在內的地緣政治不確定性可能繼續保持高位，並再次引發金融市場波動。最後但並非最不重要的一點是，隨着疫情發展反覆，可能出現潛在的負面情景，即大規模重新實施封鎖，導致持續的全球供應鏈瓶頸，並對全球增長和通脹產生不利影響。 儘管如此，香港的金融體系具備良好的條件，可以抵禦不利的衝擊，這得益於多年來建立起的韌性和緩衝。香港金管局亦擁有能力、資源和承諾，以保障香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續緊密監察本地及外部環境中的風險及漏洞，並準備就緒，在必要時部署合適措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。 2022年的研究計劃將研究影響香港經濟的問題，並評估其潛力風險。 另一方面，金管局的持續數碼化進程將協助提升其監察能力，以支持更全面的監察及對金融系統的綜合分析。\n\n# 維持銀行穩定\n\n隨著 развитых 市場收緊貨幣政策，以及疫情的影響持續存在，預期銀行業面臨的信貸環境將持續充滿挑戰。與此同時，迅速的科技進步和數位化為銀行業帶來了機遇與挑戰。面對 постоянно 改變的金融環境，香港金管局致力於確保銀行應對衝擊的能力，透過其持續的監管工作。與此同時，香港金管局亦將繼續提升和完善其銀行監管和法規框架及政策，並參考國際標準和最佳實踐。\n\n# 以風險為基礎的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n在2022年，香港金管局將加強對銀行信貸風險的監察，並推行主動步驟，以確保整體風險層面保持良好可控。\n\n金管局將亦會繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業營運狀況的生效，同時維持與銀行和商業界接近的對話，並檢討各種紓緩措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n隨著《營運韌性》新監管指引手冊（SPM）模組於2022年5月發布，金管局將繼續與業界保持聯繫，並了解持牌金融機構（AI）在發展營運韌性框架方面的進展。同時，金管局將尋求提升銀行業的網絡安全韌性，透過跟進AI在網絡韌性評估框架2.0項下評估中揭示的問題，以及監察AI的安全備份數據的實施。另一關鍵監管重點將是評估及處理AI對技術服務供應商越來越依賴的風險。\n\n憑藉加強的數位能力和疫情期間累積的廣泛遠端工作經驗，部分人工智能正計劃以常態化的方式轉向混合工作模式。香港金管局將讓軌道追蹤此發展，並評估相關風險是否已由業界充分應對。\n\n# 流動性與市場風險\n\n金管局將專注於監察人工智能的流動性及市場風險管理於2022年。特別是，金管局將繼續監察人工智能過渡餘下倫敦銀行間拆息（LIBOR）設置的進展，在這些設置於6月30日2023年停止發出之前。\n\n# 打擊洗錢和恐怖主義融資\n\n在2022年，香港金管局在打擊洗錢及 терроризм融資（AML\/CFT）的工作將繼續加強對欺詐及金融犯罪的因應，透過合作及信息分享，並投身於與AML\/CFT生態系統中的各種持份者建立更緊密的合作。其他優先事項包括實施更廣大範圍的風險敏感監察技術，利用加強數據及監察科技（Suptech）能力，以及推動銀行使用Regtech，包括交易監察系統。\n\n金管局亦將繼續與政府、銀行及預付卡發牌機構緊密合作，新增一份更新的香港洗錢及恐怖融資風險評估報告，並協助業界應對新興風險。工作亦將繼續進行，以了解反覆演變的洗錢及恐怖融資風險，實施配合國際標準的《洗錢及反恐融資條例》的變動，以及維持與其他監管機構及國際標準制定機構的主動配合。\n\n# 財富管理及相關強積金業務\n\n在2022年，香港金管局將會對虛擬資產的行為進行非現場監察及現場審查，與資產管理及銷售證券、強制性公積金（MPF）及其他投資及保險產品相關，重點關注粵港澳大灣區的跨境財富管理聯繫（跨境財富管理聯繫）計劃、數碼投顧平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產及非投資相連的長期保險產品。\n\n在與其他監管機構和銀行業維持密切聯繫的同時，金管局將提供更多關於投資、保險及強積金產品出售的監管標準指引。此指引將涵蓋在...之間的事項，包括與虛擬資產相關的投資服務以及銷售保障計劃連動保險計劃，這是一項具有高水平保險保障的新型投資連動保險計劃子集。金管局、保險監理處及強制性公積金計劃管理局將聯同推出一項神秘顧客計劃，就中介機構在有關符合資格遞延年金保單及可扣稅自願供款的銷售手法進行評估。\n\n以下，經跨境 WMC 暢順推出後，香港金管局將繼續參與業界及相關監管機構，以提升此計劃。\n\n此外，金管局將著手準備監管人工智能的信託業務，將採用新嘅SPM模組及新嘅做法。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n金管局將會繼續推動其監管下金融市場基礎設施（FMI）的安全與效率，根據《支付系統及儲值易貨發機制條例》（PSSVFO）、金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI）¹，以及支付及市場基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發布的各種指引。它會根據最新的技術和市場發展，調整FMI監管框架。\n\n金管局將與支付系統重要參與者合作，就其遵守《金融市場基礎設施原則》進行及更新評估，並在合適時作出調整。此外，金管局將繼續參與國際支付清算系統委員會-國際證監會組織《金融市場基礎設施原則》實施監察及評估試驗。金管局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並因應市場及科技發展，並在方針上符合國際慣例，加強其監察要求。金管局將與相關權威合作，在合適時進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n金管局將會繼續提升及完善其銀行監管和規定的框架及政策，並採取對國際標準及最佳實務的考慮。\n\n# 香港巴塞爾標準的實施\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局將繼續提升資本框架，並根據巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發出的標準實施，以下：\n\n銀行對基金股本投資的資本要求（2013年12月發布的EIF標準），將於2022年7月1日透過《銀行（資本）（修訂）規則》（2022年）生效，並經立法會負面審核後運作。\n\n鑑於於2017年12月制定的巴塞爾三項最終危機後改革中規定的資本標準，以及2019年1月制定的市場風險最低資本要求（於2019年2月修訂），和2020年7月制定的專項信用估值調整風險框架修訂，這些均一般稱為「巴塞爾三項最終改革方案」。 這些修訂的資本標準規定了信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整（CVA）風險和營運風險的資本處理，引入了產出底線要求，並提升了杠桿率框架。 正在與業界進行諮詢，以準備《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）的修訂(條文)，預計於2023年7月1日生效作為最低要求（除了市場風險和CVA風險2）。\n\n鑑於資本處理方案旨在補充巴塞爾委員會大型風險框架，而該框架已根據《銀行（風險限額）規則》實施，金管局將提出修訂(條文)，並與《銀行（風險限額）規則》的相關變動同時進行。\n\n# 暴露限值\n\n金管局將繼續就《銀行（風險限額）規則》的建議修訂(條文)進行諮詢，並與業界及司法署合作，目標實施日期將符合巴塞爾三項最終改革方案的日期，即2023年7月1日。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n新或修訂的披露要求主要在《Pillar 33 披露要求 – 更新框架》和《市場風險披露要求修訂(條文)》中建立，這些文件分別於2018年12月和2021年11月由巴塞爾委員會發出。巴塞爾委員會亦發出《槓桿比率披露要求修訂(條文)》，於2019年6月修訂了針對槓桿比率的披露要求，以應對就潛力“粉飾” (即銀行在報告日期前後操縱某些交易量以虛增其槓桿比率，用於報告和公開披露)

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart

經濟與金融環境\n\n憑藉強勁的商品出口、回升的本地需求，以及政府支持性措施的推動，香港經濟在2021年回復正成長，扭轉了2019年和2020年經歷的收縮。勞工市場亦改善，通脹仍然溫和，雖然微升。 儘管預期在第五波新冠疫情減退後經濟復甦將繼續，但其強勁程度和速度受制於不確定性和風險，尤其受疫情造成的影響以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑。\n\n# 經濟檢討\n\n# 實際活動\n\n由於強勁的商品出口和改善的本地需求帶動，香港本地生產總值（GDP）在2021年增長了6.3%，截至2019年和2020年的經濟收縮。私人消費受惠於改善的勞工市場狀況以及政府消費券計劃1的推動而復甦。整體投資支出亦有所反彈，反映營商環境和前景改善2。外部方面，香港的商品出口錄得強勁的全年增長，其中一章支持於持續的全球經濟復甦。服務出口錄得溫和的增長，反映活躍的區域貿易和貨物流動，以及更強勁的跨境商業和金融活動。總進口大幅上升，主要由於本地和轉口帶動的需求更大。從淨值角度來看，外部貿易帶來支持了2021年的實質本地生產總值（GDP）增長（圖1），因為總出口增長較快於進口。\n\n表 1 實際 本地生產總值 增長，按支出構成劃分 (期間比較)\n\n附註：毛國內固定資本形成季調後的按季變化率目前不可獲得。 資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通貨膨脹壓力微升但全年維持溫和。剔除政府應屆一次性補貼措施的效應，經年調整後，核心通貨膨脹率逐步上升至12月溫和的1.4% (圖2)4。餐飲、交通、衣履等消費品價格隨著本地消費需求改善而重拾上升動力。進口價格亦因全球供應鏈瓶頸以及國際能源和商品價格急升而顯著上升。相反，房屋組別對整體通貨膨脹構成拖累，反映了先前私人物業租金下跌的影響 (圖2)。大致而言，名義工資和商業租金的增長緩慢有助讓國內商業成本壓力得以控制。就2021年整體而言，核心和總體通貨膨脹率分別維持在0.6%和1.6%。\n\n圖2 基本消費者物價膨脹\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，勞工市場在2021年改善。2月份失業率達到7.2%的首個17年高點後，12月明顯下跌至4.0% (圖3)，且下跌情況橫跨大多數經濟領域。整體勞工需求逐步轉強，反映在總就業人數增加 (圖3) 以及私營部門空缺方面。儘管如此，它們仍低於疫情爆發前的高點。另一方面，勞工人口較一年前減少了1.3%，部分由於勞工參與率溫和下跌。名義工資和勞工收入的按年增長，雖然溫和，但在2021年首個三個季，仍顯示出加速的跡象，扭轉了2019及2020年的放緩趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n本地股市在當年大致呆滯，儘管一些主要海外股本市場繼續上升（圖4）。延續2020年底的反彈，恆生指數上升至31,085點高位，於2021年2月17日達至，但自此市場情緒急轉負面，由於一系列因素，包括對新型COVID-19病毒變種的憂慮、主要中央銀行潛力緊縮貨幣政策以及透過互聯互通7南向交易減少的流入。恆生指數收報23,398點，較一年前顯著下跌14.1%。\n\n圖4 資產價格\n資料來源：地政總署及香港交易所。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場在2021年首個上半年隨著更好的經濟機遇重拾上升動力，但隨着轉弱的資產市場氣氛，第二個上半年出現了整固（圖4）。整體而言，房屋價格和成交量在2021年分別錄得3.7%和24.1%的上升。家庭負擔能力亦變得更偏緊，部分反映了家庭收入的減少。另一方面，經過2019年和2020年的顯著調整後，非住宅物業市場一般改善，工業物業的價格和租金一般上升至疫情爆發前的峰值，而零售和辦公室空間的則仍然低於其分別的峰值。\n\n見到表B：主要經濟指標，在326頁至327頁有更詳細的資料，包括2017–2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n在2022年盡早，本地COVID-19感染的第五波亦造成對本地經濟活動的壓力。為因應此情況，政府推出第五輪及第六輪防疫基金，並在2022–23預算中增加逆周期措施，以協助支持經濟。香港金管局與銀行界一同延長了預先批准本金償還寬限計劃至2022年10月。\n\n2022 年整體而言，經濟復甦預計將繼續，雖然步伐相比 2021 年而言較為溫和，部分反映了第五波 COVID-19 造成的影響、較緩慢的全球經濟增長、較不明顯的基礎 影響，以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測 2022 年實際 本地生產總值增長將在 1–2% 的範圍內，而國際組織和私營部門分析員的最新 預測 平均為 1.1%。 儘管如此，復甦的強度和步伐 受制於眾多不確定性和風險，尤其是在疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的路徑方面。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n隨著進口價格上升以及疫情造成的物流中斷，預測通膨壓力在短期內將會輕微上升，但由於租金低迷和本地勞工成本壓力溫和，大致仍會受到控制。市場共識預測2022年的整體通膨率為2.4%，而政府的預測則分別為整體和核心通膨率為2.1%和2.0%。本地COVID-19疫情的第五波浪潮在2022年早期造成了對勞動市場的壓力，尤其是在需要大量聯絡的行業。展望未來，勞動市場狀況將取決於疫情發展和國內經濟復甦的步伐。\n\n# 金融業表現\n\n香港銀行業在2021年繼續維持穩定。總體銀行資產溫和擴大，貸款和存款均有上升。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況仍然良好。資產品質在歷史和國際標準下均維持在健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n銀行業的資產負債表在2021年增長了1.9%。 由於經濟復甦，總貸款錄得3.8%的增長，相比2020年的1.2%。 在總體上，香港境內貸款增長了4.4%，境外貸款使用增長了1.1%，貿易融資上升了14.2%。 與2020年大致穩定相比，面向內地相關貸款在2021年擴大增長了3.6%。\n\n在負債方面，總存款上升了4.6%，相比2020年的5.4%。由於總存款的上升步伐較快於總貸款，整體貸款與存款比率微升至2021年底的71.8%，較一年前的72.3%有所下降（圖6）。\n\n圖5 銀行業貸款及存款\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業 仍然 資本 充足。 本地 註冊 的 授權機構 (AI) 的 總 合 資本 比例 高達 20.2%，在 2021 年底。 第一 層 資本 比例 為 18.2% (圖 6)。 兩者 比例 都 高於 他們 各自 的 國際 最低 要求，分別 為 8% 和 6%。\n\n巴塞爾ⅲ 的槓桿比率在 2021 年底為 7.9%，遠高於法定最低要求 3% （圖 7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性地位良好。第1類機構8在2021年第四季度的流動性覆蓋比率（LCR）的季度平均值為151.9%。\n\n高於法定最低要求100%。第二類機構的季度流動性維持比率 (LMR) 平均值為59.1%，亦良好地高於法定最低要求25% (圖8)。\n\n圖8 指定人工智能的流動性比率\n來源：香港金管局。\n\n銀行業的資金來源仍然穩定。第一類機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）在2021年底達到135.3%，遠高於法定最低要求100%。 核心資金\n\n第二類機構的比例（CFR）在年底2021年為150.3%，亦良好地高於法定最低要求75%（圖9）。\n\n圖9 指定人工智能的融資比率\n來源：香港金管局。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n資產品質 仍然

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.  The conference discussed recent policy developments related to common prosperity, dual circulation, anti-monopoly regulations, property market, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and financial developments in the Greater Bay Area5.  Expert speakers also presented in-depth analyses on the impact of population ageing and the sustainability of social security funds, as well as China’s contribution to global financial stability and world economy.  The six different sessions of the conference attracted over 3,200 online and on-site viewers, totaling 5,900

貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管持續的憂慮造成的疫情和美國貨幣緊縮步伐的上升，香港的美元匯率和貨幣市場繼續以暢順有序的方式進行交易。 作為自1983年實施以來，香港貨幣和金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度展現了其對外部衝擊的韌性和強度。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是貨幣穩定。這定義為香港貨幣與美元在外匯市場的匯率維持在一個穩定的外部交換價值區間，對內以港元7.75–7.85兌一美元為基準。貨幣體系的結構主要採用貨幣委員會安排，需要貨幣基礎至少支持100%的美元儲備，並由匯生基金所持有的美元儲備進行相關變動以配合貨幣基礎的變動。\n\n# 貨幣基礎（表一）包括：\n\n債務憑證，為三家發行銀行發行之鈔票提供全面支持；政府發行的流通貨幣紙鈔及硬幣；總結餘，即存放在香港金管局的清算賬戶餘額總和；以及香港金管局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及附註。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性，是透過自動利率調整機制以及金管局兌 Convertibility Undertakings (CUs) 的堅決承諾而維持。當強方 (或弱方) CU 被觸發，金管局準備就緒，可根據要求以 7.75 (或 7.85) 美元兌一美元的比率向 (或從) 銀行買入 (或賣出) 香港美元，總結餘額會擴大 (或縮小)，促使香港美元利率下跌 (或上漲)，以協助香港美元回到 7.75 至 7.85 的恆常兌換區對內。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n由於股票相關需求產生，以及南向 港股通 成交，年初香港元匯率 接近 強勢一側的結售匯兌換保證金，隨着股市回調以及部分新上市企業將首次公開發售 (IPO) 收益匯回，其轉弱。其後，由於企業股息支付 需要 以及南向 港股通 的淨流入，第二 季度略為回升。踏入 該 年 的 一半，儘管股票市場情緒回軟，香港元匯率仍維持 在 強勢方 的兌換保證金區域內，並繼續以 暢順 和 有序 的 方式 運作 (圖 1)。整體而言，香港元匯市場全 年 正常 運作。\n\n圖一 二零二一年市場匯率\n\n隨着 CUs 並未觸發，總的總結餘額及未結清的遠期外匯掉期仍然無大變動，在 2021 年維持在約 15,263 港元。在該年，香港金管局共發行了 80 十億 增加的交換基金票據，以滿足銀行持續對交換基金票據的需求，在銀行體系中充裕的流動性中，導致總結餘額從 2020 年底的 457.5 十億 縮減至 2021 年底的 377.5 十億。（圖 2）\n\n反映了按照既定做法發行交換基金票據以及發行EFBN以吸納EFBN利息支付，該年未結欠款的EFBN由港元1,069.2十億上升至港元1,148.8十億。整體貨幣基礎仍然十足地得到外匯儲備的支持。\n\n# 港元15,263十億\n\n總餘額及未結清的電子銀行交易\n\n圖2 總結餘額（折扣期窗前）及2021年香港金融管理局未償債券。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n憑藉龐大的總結餘額，港元銀行同業利率全年在低層面保持大致穩定（圖3）。儘管首個季度由於首次公開發售活動，對港元的需求上升，各種期限的香港銀行同業拆息率（HIBORs）錄得輕微波動。此後，儘管對美國貨幣緊縮步伐的憂慮，HIBORs 仍然大致穩定。接近年底，HIBORs 見到輕微上升，部分反映了年底的資金需要。在零售方面，銀行維持最佳貸款利率不變。整體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續正常職能。 貼現窗借貸在2021年下降至 6.8 十億 港元，而2020年為 9.1 十億 港元。\n\n圖3 2021年香港美元銀行同業利率\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯繫匯率制度 (LERS) 一直是 香港 金融體系的強大支柱，並展現了其面對挑戰的穩健與韌性。 儘管全球經濟復甦 造成的持續不確定性，港元匯率和貨幣市場 繼續以有序的方式 運作，反映了 LERS 的穩健。 政府 堅決 致力於 LERS。 在 2021 年《外部部門報告》中，國際貨幣基金組織再次重申，一套透明的規則、充裕的財政和外匯儲備、強勁的金融監管與監察、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架，已保障了 LERS 的可信度。\n\n一個良好嘅銀行體系對 LERS嘅正常運作至關重要。香港嘅銀行業繼續順利營運，就國際標準而言，流動性狀況同資本化表現良好。為確保銀行體系嘅韌性，金管局一向緊密監察銀行對信貸、流動性同利率風險嘅管理，以及壓力測試嘅結果，並且維持住對銀行貸款嘅監管工作。\n\n為優化貨幣發行機制帳戶的透明度，自10月以來，一特定部分已配置資源在...下支持貨幣基礎。在2021年期間，支持比率（定義為支持資產分為貨幣基礎）上落於109.8%至110.5%的範圍內，未觸及上或下觸發點。該比率於12月31日收報110.2%（圖4）。在應急基金計劃下，雖然已指定特定 Exchange Fund 資產用於支持投資組合，但所有 Exchange Fund 資源均可支持香港的聯繫匯率。Exchange Fund 充裕的財務資源，以及穩健的銀行體系，有助於為香港的貨幣和金融穩定提供強大支持。\n\n圖4 2021年每日的支持比率變化。\n\n# 貨幣委員會委員會\n\n香港金管局匯率發行局委員會（委員會）監察並審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。 於2021年，委員會探討了多項議題，包括對美國通脹的評估、美元貶值對香港的影響、評估「縮減風暴」風險及其對香港的影響，以及理解內地相關資金流動對香港貨幣狀況的影響。 委員會就這些議題的討論錄得，以及提交給委員會的匯率發行局營運報告，均已發出至金管局網站。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n年底，流通中的票據銀行發行紙幣總值為港元5,926十億，較一年前上升5.9%（圖5、6和7）。政府發行的紙幣和硬幣流通總值於年底總值為港元12.9十億，按年上升1.7%（圖8和9）。\n\n# 港元五千九百二十六十億，上升5.9%。\n\n銀行發行附註發行的紙鈔總價值\n\n# 港元十億一千二百九十，上升百分之1.7。\n\n政府發行的紙幣和硬幣總值\n\n# 圖5\n\n年底，各銀行發行流通中的紙鈔。\n\n# 圖6\n\n年底流通紙幣的分銷\n\n# 香港紙幣\n\n在該年，香港金管局安排了14場研討會，超過4,000名參加者，包括銀行和零售行業的專業人士以及學生，以協助他們提升在辨別真偽鈔票方面的知識和技能。這些關於香港鈔票設計及安全功能的公眾教育項目，受到了良好歡迎。\n\n# 硬幣收數計劃\n\n硬幣收數計劃繼續受到公眾的良好歡迎。更多關於此計劃的資料載於永續發展章節的198頁。\n\n# 外匯基金票據及票息憑證\n\n匯基金批次計劃繼續順利營運。 隨着銀行體系內充裕的流動性，為滿足銀行對匯基金票據的持續需求，香港金管局在2021年下半年共發行了總額為港元80十億增加的匯基金票據。 額外發行令總結餘減少。 到2021年底，未償還的匯基金票據的面值高達港元1,148.6十億（表2）。\n\n表2 聯匯基金票據及票息證券未結清事項\n\n# 貨幣研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）儘管疫情持續，在2021年亦維持了穩定的研究成果。在該年，HKIMR 發布了30篇工作論文，並舉辦了9場網絡研討會，涵蓋了廣泛的主題，包括貨幣政策、銀行穩定性、市場微結構和金融科技（fintech）發展。HKIMR 亦舉辦了一場國際會議和一場網絡研討會，採用混合模式。\n\n研討會題為「人民幣匯率形成機制與匯率展望」，於8月17日與香港金融學院合辦。該研討會透過多個網絡平台直播，吸引了總數超過1.16百萬即時觀看量。\n\n第11屆國際論壇中國經濟學會議，題為「通往共同富裕之路：雙循環背景下中國的經濟發展」，於11月舉辦。會議討論了與共同富裕、雙循環、反壟斷法規、房地產市場、大灣區通關財富管理聯繫以及金融發展等相關的最新政策發展。專家演講者亦就人口老齡化和社會保障基金的可持續性，以及中國對全球金融穩定和世界經濟的貢獻，進行了深入分析。會議的六個不同環節吸引了超過3,200名線上和現場觀眾，總觀看量達到5,900。\n\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022

銀行穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業在2021年 儘管出現了更具傳染性的 COVID-19 變種病毒，導致全球經濟復甦的不確定性， 仍然保持穩健和穩定。 該年，香港金管局 繼續...重點放在對持牌金融機構風險管理之監察。 鑑於網絡威脅持續增加和銀行業的加速數碼化，對持牌金融機構的營運和網絡韌力亦加強了監察。\n\n在監管行為方面，金管局向銀行提供指引，以促進使用非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，為市場上如連結保險證券及虛擬資產等新產品制定監管要求。銀行業行為守則亦修訂，以提升數字金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n在打擊洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）領域，香港金管局的工作重點是進一步加強銀行在生態系統中的龍門角色，以及其防止和偵測與疫情期間網絡欺詐、水客帳戶網絡及其他金融犯罪相關的非法資金流動的能力。為增加客戶帳戶免受欺詐和金融犯罪的保護，香港金管局深化了與其他持份者透過公私合作夥伴關係的合作和資訊分享。在支持遠程客戶開戶的同時，香港金管局亦鼓勵採用其他科技，包括透過首個AML Regtech實驗室的推出，利用網絡分析技術。在國際上，主動參與使香港金管局在金融行動任務組織的全球AML\/CFT工作方面保持領先。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理聯繫計劃試驗計劃於9月順利推出。在過去的一年，香港金管局繼續執行為期兩年的推動香港金融科技應用普及的路線圖。若干舉措推出，為銀行氣候風險管理作出基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色和可持續性銀行業，正如在可持續發展章節中討論的。在軟基礎設施方面，亦有進一步努力，包括推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業合作推出能力建設倡議，以促進人才發展，並建立聯繫。\n\n另一方面，香港金管局與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策和流程。在本地實施國際監管標準方面，作出良好進展，包括資本充足率和披露等方面的標準。香港金管局繼續推進其工作，以確保為持牌金融機構建立具公信力的重組機制，包括發展新重組標準，以及實施有關減損損失吸收能力要求的規則，以提升持牌金融機構的重組能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的總體目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。實現此目標取決於一個高度具有韌性的金融體系，能夠提供香港經濟需要的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務的**方式**可能**影響**系統的穩定性，在**極端**情況下，甚至可能以**失序**的**方式****倒閉**。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在**確保**金融穩定方面發揮關鍵作用，**幫助**銀行對抗衝擊並在**危機**中**恢復**地位，**最終****防止****倒閉**。 金融管理局負責對銀行的審慎監管，並負責授權**香港**的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和存款**吸收**公司，這些公司統稱為獲授權機構 (AI)。\n\n然而，金融管理局無法確保，亦非香港的審慎監管框架旨在確保零風險的金融體系。相反，金融管理局作為解決方案權威機構，旨在確保在認可機構倒閉時，其倒閉可以有序地處理。為此，已在香港設立了針對金融機構的解決方案體制，根據該體制，金融管理局是認可機構的解決方案權威機構，以及其他類型機構。為了落實香港的解決方案體制，制定解決方案規則和政策標準，並進行解決方案規劃以消除認可機構可解決性的障礙，以及發展金融管理局解決失敗認可機構的運作能力至關重要。為了有效執行這些工作，金融管理局採納國際協調一致的方法。年底\n\n香港金融管理局亦負責指定和監督某些金融市場基礎設施（FMI）。在監督FMI時，香港金融管理局的目標是推動它們的一般安全與效率，限制系統性風險，並促進透明度。使FMI更能抵禦金融危機，有助於保護香港的貨幣和金融系統免受因FMI中斷而產生的不穩定效應。就香港金融管理局的監督方法而言，相關資訊可在香港金融管理局網站上可獲得。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 授權\n\n年底，香港擁有：\n\n在該年，香港金管局授予兩間銀行牌照及一間限制性銀行牌照予三間外地銀行。香港金管局亦授予一間貨幣經紀牌照予一間外國交易平台營運商。在該年，三間持牌銀行及兩間限制性牌照銀行被撤銷牌照。\n\n關於人工智能及香港本地代表處的更多資訊，請參閱附件以及D至F表，載於321至324頁，以及330至333頁分別。\n\n# 簡介\n\n金管局進行了涵蓋廣泛議題的189場非現場審查，包括CAMEL評級評估、企業管治、風險管理以及金融科技（fintech）策略。作為金管局繼續推動更強風險管治工作其中一章，與持牌機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或委員會共舉辦了40場會議。此外，金管局、持牌機構及其外部審計師之間又舉辦了38場三方會議。\n\n除了非現場活動外，金管局進行了定期現場審查，並配合對評估風險較高的範疇進行主題審查。 隨着越來越多金融機構採用科技，營運風險和科技風險的管理亦是另一主要注意範疇。 此外，金管局增加了針對流動性風險和市場風險管理的現場審查和主題審查的數目。 另外，專業團隊對虛擬資產經紀商（AIs）在證券、投資產品、保險和強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動，以及其反洗錢和打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施進行現場審查和主題審查。 表一載有金管局2021年的監管活動概要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n二零二一年總貸款上升了 3.8%，相比二零二零年的增長 1.2%。 表 2 顯示貸款和 推進 的 分類。\n\n內地相關貸款上升了 3.6%，至 2021 年的 47,250 港元。\n\n銀行業的資產品質在該年大致維持穩定，無論從歷史數據還是國際標準來看，都維持在良好水平。截至2021年底，該行業的不良貸款比率為0.86%，較2020年底的九成下降，遠低於自2000年以來長期歷史平均水平1.8%。與內地相關貸款的比率亦下降至0.86%，較一年前的0.96%。\n\n在一年內，新冠肺炎疫情繼續對經濟的某些領域造成影響，而中國內地房地產領域的信用活動引起了市場的注意。香港金管局加強了監察的廣度和深度，進行了專注於銀行對高度借助借款人的風險敞口的深入審查。與銀行維持密切聯繫，以促進對經濟和市場發展的最新評估，以及評估銀行風險管理措施的足夠性。整體而言，評估銀行體系面臨的信用風險是可控的。香港金管局最新 solvency stress tests 的結果證確認銀行體系繼續維持足夠的緩衝，以抵禦極端壓力。\n\n專項且主題性的評估在當年進行，以評估人工智能系統及其在貸款分類和貸款損失準備、海外貸款業務以及向私人銀行和資產管理客戶提供抵押貸款方面的控制。\n\n# 紓緩客戶面臨的資金周轉壓力\n\n9月，香港金管局及銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制公布了延期6個月的預批本金還款寬限計劃，直至2022年4月尾。此計劃首個推出於2020年5月，旨在延後合資格企業客戶的本金還款6個月。鑑於本地冠狀病毒感染的反彈，於2022年2月，計劃進一步延長至2022年10月尾。此外，計劃已加強，為那些具備金融能力且願意逐步恢復本金還款的客戶提供1年期部分本金還款選項。\n\n截至2021年12月年底，銀行已批准延期貸款年期及其他形式的寬減措施，涉及超過83,000個案，總金額超過港元920十億。對於個人客戶，銀行已批准超過52,000個案的按揭及其他個人貸款本金還款寬限，涉及金額超過港元53十億。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年以來推出的一系列逆周期宏觀審慎措施，轉強了銀行風險管理，以及本地物業市場可能突然下滑時，銀行業的韌性。截至2021年12月，首個新住宅按揭貸款（RML）的平均按揭成數（LTV）為53%，相比2009年9月在逆周期措施首次推出前的64%。截至2021年12月，新按揭貸款的平均償債比率（DSR）仍然低於36%，相比2010年8月首次應用DSR上限時的41%（圖1）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n鑑於銀行對技術的依賴不斷增加，金管局加強了對營運和科技風險的監管。 過去一年，主要的監管重點包括雲端外包和遠端工作安排的控制。 金管局於12月推出了一份關於「營運韌性」的新草案監管政策手冊（SPM）模組，以供業界諮詢。

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms)

國際金融中心\n\n在2021年，香港金管局通過多管齊下，達致了香港作為全球具競爭力國際金融中心之地位的良好進展，並加強了其地位。\n\n金管局公佈「金融科技2025」策略，旨在推動金融科技在金融界內廣泛採用，並大致鞏固香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。隨着新冠疫情期間，快速支付系統的成交額急升，全年呈現增長。\n\n在增強聯繫方面，本年作出顯著進展，此外，跨境財富管理聯繫計劃及債券交易互聯互通計劃（南向）已加入一系列聯繫計劃。 由於其世界一流的市場基礎設施以及聯繫計劃，香港是內地基金挖掘全球市場，以及國際投資者接觸內地越來越快速增長的市場的首選平台。\n\n亦在2021年，香港金管局致力締造新機遇，加強香港金融平台的競爭力，範疇包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心，以及綠色及可持續融資。為推動香港的金融服務，香港金管局加強了與海外及內地持份者的市場聯繫，讓他們認識香港金融體系的韌性及其所呈現的機遇。\n\n另一方面，香港金管局積極參與國際和區域中央銀行及監管論壇，作出貢獻於維持全球金融穩定及推動金融市場發展。\n\n# 簡介\n\n香港金管局公布了「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列舉措，以推動金融科技（fintech）的廣泛採用，並加強香港作為亞洲金融科技樞紐的地位。香港金管局金融科技促進辦事處（FFO）與銀行部門一同，在推動各種關鍵舉措方面發揮了關鍵作用，包括以下內容：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）的採用\n推出科技基礎評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位仍然堅決，在過去的一年，離岸人民幣業務登記了良好增長。流入人民幣資產的步伐繼續上升，因為境內證券被納入主要金融市場指數的過程繼續進行。香港在促進國際投資者增加對人民幣資產配置方面發揮著不可或缺的作用，而內地與香港互聯互通計劃被廣泛接受為國際投資者接觸境內資本市場的首選途徑。2021 年，北向通債券互聯互通的每日成交額上升了 34%，達到約 258 億人民幣。\n\n以下是北向通的成功後，南向通於9月推出，完善了內地與國際債券市場的兩向連接。同月，中國人民銀行、香港金管局及澳門金融管理局頒布了粵港澳大灣區（GBA）跨境財富管理互聯互通計劃（Crossboundary WMC）的實施細則。10月，香港合資格銀行開始與其內地合作銀行一同提供跨境財富管理互聯互通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為主要離岸人民幣中心的地位，一個包括香港金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）及香港交易所（HKEX）的 рабочая группа 成為了進行一項關於推動在香港交易以人民幣計值的股本證券可行性研究。中國人民銀行與香港金管局亦在12月合辦了一場研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領導人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n香港金管局繼續作出進展，接近加強香港金融平台的競爭力。特別是，為了提升香港作為首選基金管轄地的吸引力，香港金管局與政府及金融業界合作，提供更具促進性的稅務及監管環境，以促進基金成立。同時，香港金管局亦作出重大進展，進一步加強香港作為區域綠色及可持續融資中心，以及債券發行中心的地位。與此同時，香港金管局亦加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者推動香港的金融服務。\n\n維護金融基礎設施的高效運作，是鞏固香港作為領導國際金融中心地位的根本。 2021年，四個銀行間實時總額結算系統（RTGS）、中央貨幣市場單位的運作，以及香港交易存儲庫達致了100%系統可用率，超出95%的目標。 以下，隨著南向通在9月推出，中央貨幣市場單位變得為北向通和南向通兩項聯繫的交易提供結算及保管服務。\n\nFPS 的採用情況繼續擴大，至 2021 年底，註冊數目增長至 960 百萬。 該年每日平均交易額較 2020 年上升了九成。 越來越多的人使用 FPS 支付政府帳戶費用、商家付款以及為儲值易 (SVF) 電子錢包或銀行帳戶充值，這些都是促使交易量持續上升的主要推動力，再加上個人對個人和商戶之間的付款穩定增長。\n\n為推動本地零售支付業的 安全 及 效率，香港金管局 負責監察 6 個 指定 零售支付系統 (RPSs) ，並根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》(PSSVFO) 監察 15 個 持牌 儲值支付工具。 於本 年，香港金管局透過協調及 推動 政府各 相關 方面及 為此 計劃 委任 的 儲值支付工具 持牌商 之間的 對話及 合作，促成了 政府 消費券 計劃 的 暢順 運作。\n\n2022年1月，香港金管局發布一項討論文件，內容關於加密資產及穩定幣，闡述香港金管局對相關監管方法的思考，並邀請持份者提供回饋。在制定合適的監管制度時，將會考慮相關因素，包括對此討論文件的回饋及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n國際上，香港金管局是中央銀行社群的積極成員，並在數個區域性及國際性委員會中扮演領導角色。例如，香港金管局是東亞太平洋地區中央銀行論壇（EMEAP）2下設立的金融市場工作小組的聯席主席。香港金管局亦聯席主席巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）的政策與標準組、非銀行監察專家小組以及金融穩定理事會（FSB）的金融創新網絡，並促使一個團隊研究金融基準過渡相關的監管問題。\n\n# 2021年檢討\n\n# 香港作為亞洲的金融科技中心\n\n# 金融科技 2025\n\n6月，香港金管局發表了「金融科技2025」策略，以帶動香港的金融科技發展。該策略的目標是，到2025年全面應用科技，鼓勵金融界提供良好且高效的金融服務，惠及香港市民和經濟。該策略的五個範疇是：\n\n所有銀行進行金融科技。\n加深研究香港以適應央行數字貨幣。\n締造下一代數據基礎設施。\n擴展精通金融科技的勞動力。\n透過資金和政策來培育生態系統。\n\n香港金管局的「創科2025」策略推動香港的金融科技發展。\n\n# 金融科技在銀行業的應用\n\n為支持「全體銀行進行金融科技」的「金融科技2025」策略，金管局於2021年6月推出科技基礎評估。 評估的目標是協助金管局對當前銀行業的金融科技現況有更好理解，並識別哪些金融科技範疇可能需要金管局的支持。 所有在香港有顯著業務的持牌銀行被要求於2021年底前制訂為期三年的金融科技採用計劃。\n\n在該年，香港金管局亦繼續實施為期兩年的路線圖，以推動香港銀行採用監管科技，並將科技融入其自身的監察流程中，以優化效率和成效。見銀行穩定性章節的第98頁以了解更多詳情。\n\n# 批發中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n香港金管局和泰國銀行擴大其聯合研究項目的範圍，在2021年2月，阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行和中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所加入。該項目更名為「多個中央銀行數字貨幣橋 (mBridge)」，並得到香港國際結算銀行（BIS）創新中心大力支持，進一步探討分散式分類帳技術在多司法管轄區範圍內，以即時跨境外匯支付對支付（PvP）交易的潛力，並以24小時不間斷的方式進行。一份聯合報告於9月發出，旨在傳達中期結果，其後於11月發布潛在個案和未來發展路線圖。\n\n# 零售中央銀行數位貨幣\n\n為確保香港在央數幣（CBDC）準備方面具有備來之數，香港金管局開始研究在香港發行零售央數幣的前景，即電子港元（e-HKD），涵蓋技術及政策考量。香港金管局與香港BIS創新中心合作，踏上名為Project Aurum的研究，以探討發行零售央數幣的技術層面。此外，設立了一個跨部門內部工作小組，用以研究相關的技術、政策及法律問題。10月，香港金管局發布了一篇題為《電子港元：技術觀點》的技術白皮書，旨在探討並邀請對發行及分銷零售央數幣的潛力技術設計選項提出意見。\n\n此外，香港金管局支持中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所就數字人民幣用以跨境支付的技術試點項目。這將協助推動大灣區互聯互通，並為香港及內地旅客帶來更大便利，同時增強跨境支付的效率和用戶經驗。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n七月，香港金管局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行和 SVF 營運商參與 CDI，這是一項新一代金融數據基礎設施，目標是促進銀行體系中更高效的金融中介。為進一步促進發展和採用，研討會期間公布了 CDI 創新中心將會推出。為促進細、中型企業 (SME) 的融資，香港金管局完成了 CDI

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange

儲備管理\n\n全球金融市場於2021年踏上復甦路徑。儘管全球經濟繼續受影響於反覆演變的COVID-19疫情，但多個因素，包括增加的疫苗接種率，以及全球各地的寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施，帶來支持了全球經濟和金融市場的致力復甦。在此背景下，不少海外股票市場達致歷史新高，而投資基金的整體股票持有量儘管香港股票表現呆滯，仍能爭取不俗的回報。在2021年，投資基金錄得港元1,919十億的投資收入，相當於4.1%的投資回報。\n\n# 基金交換\n\n聯匯基金的首要目標，如《聯匯基金條例》所訂明，是直接或間接影響香港的貨幣匯率。 基金可能亦可被運用來維持香港的貨幣及金融體系的穩定性及完整性，協助維護香港作為國際金融中心的地位。 金融管理局在財政司長的轉授權下，於轉授的條款範圍內，對內負責財政司長，就聯匯基金的使用和投資管理。\n\n# 基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）已為聯匯基金訂立以下投資目標：\n\n（i）保障資本；\n（ii）確保整個貨幣基礎，在任何時候，都十足地以流通性高的美元資產支持；\n（iii）確保有足夠的流通性，以維持貨幣和金融穩定為目的；以及\n（iv）受制於（i）–（iii），爭取一項投資回報，以協助保障信託基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標已充分考慮到聯繫基金的法定目的，並註冊於基金的投資組合架構及目標資產配置中（圖示1）。\n\n圖示一 聯匯基金的投資組合劃分\n\n大致來說，外匯基金擁有兩項主要投資組合：支持投資組合（BP）和投資投資組合（IP）。BP 擁有高度流通性高的美元資產，以提供全面支持給貨幣基礎，這是在貨幣委員會安排下所需。IP 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債券和股票市場，以保障其資產的價值和長期的購買力。\n\n為更好管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金管局日益分散其中一章聯邦匯款基金的投資，以謹慎和漸進的方式，擴展至更廣大類別的資產。 其中包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權（包括基礎設施）以及房地產。 新興市場及內地債券和股票受制於IP架構，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。 自此以來，香港金管局訂下上限，以指引進入LTGP的分散步伐。 隨著LTGP的投資規模和資產分散日益成熟，於2022年1月，聯邦匯款基金投資諮詢委員會決定用目標資產配置代替上限，該配置將與其他資產類別同時制定，並遵守謹慎的風險管理原則。\n\n策略投資組合，於2007年設立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，這些股份是政府為交易所基金的策略目的而收購的。 策略投資組合因其獨特的性質，未有包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 與投資基金的存款\n\n外匯基金會不時接受財政儲備、政府基金和法定機構的存款。利率一般根據IP2的表現而定，主要例外是未來基金3，其利率根據IP和LTGP的回報，依照投資組合比例而定。 2021年，未來基金在IP和LTGP之間的投資組合比例約為40：60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程支撐於兩類型資產配置的決定：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置，反映於投資基準，代表聯匯基金投資目標的長期資產配置，鑑於此。指引下，資產會以戰術方式配置，爭取在基準之上實現額外回報。這表示實際配置往往與基準（或策略性）配置不同。實際配置與基準配置之間的差異稱為「戰術性偏差」。雖然基準和循跡誤差的限制由財政司長在與聯匯基金監察委員會諮詢後制定，戰術性決策和戰術性偏差的容許範圍由香港金管局在轉授權下作出並建立。在容許的戰術性偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可能採取 позиции 以獲利於短期市場波動（圖示 2）。\n\n圖示2 投資基金資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局投資局負責匯儲基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。金管局投資局員工直接管理匯儲基金約71%的投資，包括全部BP及IP的其中一章。這部分IP包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及各種實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理員\n\n此外，除了內部管理資產，金管局也僱用外部基金經理管理約29%的投資基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他特別的資產類別。 聘用外部經理的目的是為了挖掘市場上可獲得的最佳投資專業知識，以獲取可持續的回報，汲取多元且互補的投資方式，並獲得市場見解和技術專業知識於投資。\n\n有關使用外部經理的管理支出包括基金管理費及保管費、交易成本，以及預扣及其他稅款。此項支出主要由市場因素制定，可能不同於年年。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境的複雜性越來越高，突顯了風險管理的重要性。香港金管局制定了嚴格的監控和投資指引，適用於內部和外部管理的投資組合，並確保嚴謹的風險監察及合規系統推行。已建立三道防線，以實施有效的風險管理和投資相關活動的治理。關鍵風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及營運風險）會定期監察，風險管理流程提供良好框架，以支持策略規劃和投資多元化。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n鑑於香港金管局相信，通過設立對責任投資和可持續長期經濟表現的合適重視，可以更好爭取投資基金的投資目標，並減低與其基礎投資的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關事宜相關的風險。香港金管局支持責任投資，將ESG因素併入投資基金的公共市場和私人市場投資的投資流程，其支撐原則是，如果風險調整後的長期回報與其他投資相若，一般將優先考慮ESG投資。更多關於香港金管局責任投資框架及落實的詳情，見於頁184至191的永續發展章節。\n\n# 基金表現\n\n# 2021年的金融市場\n\n全球股票市場急劇上升，衝擊至新高， وذلك在極度寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施的推動下，加速了全球經濟和金融市場的復甦。然而，香港和中國大陸股票市場遜色，隨着市場改革。標準普爾500指數在我們上升了27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌了14%。\n\n對於債券市場而言，通膨預期上升以及美國聯準會（Fed）的資產購買縮減，導致2021年底美國國庫券殖利率上升，債券價格下跌。十年期美國國庫券殖利率從年初的0.9%上升至年底的1.5%，上升了約60個基點。\n\n在外匯市場上，美元兌其他主要貨幣轉強，尤其是在2021年底， وذلك 在對聯準會縮減步伐的預期下。特別是，歐元和日圓分別對美元貶值了7.1%和10.3%。\n\n二零二一年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現，請參閱表一。\n\n# 聯匯基金表現\n\n外匯基金錄得2021年投資收益1,919十億港元。 其中包括債券收益126十億港元，股本淨收益478十億港元（其中外地股本收益688十億港元，香港股本虧損210億港元），非港元資產的正貨幣換算生效額168十億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬機構持有其他投資的收益1,147十億港元。 此外，戰略投資組合錄得估值收益31十億港元。\n\n聯邦基金總值達到 港元 45,702 十億元，年底。信託基金計劃 (LTGP) 投資的市場價值總值為 港元 5,153 十億元，其中私募股權總值為 港元 3,925 十億元，而房地產則為 港元 1,228 十億元。信託基金計劃 (LTGP) 的未償投資承諾總值為 港元 2,257 十億元。\n\n聯匯基金2021年的投資回報，不包括策略投資組合，為4.1%。 具體而言，IP錄得回報率為3.7%，而BP錄得4%。自2009年成立以來，長期股本投資組合錄得年化的內部回報率為15.4%。\n\n聯邦投資公司的年度回報，自 1994 年至 2021 年，載於圖 1。表 2 顯示 2021 年的投資回報以及該基金在若干不同時段的平均投資回報。2019 年至 2021 年的平均回報為 5.3%，2017 年至 2021 年為 4.7%，2012 至 2021 年為 3.3%，自 1994 年以來為 4.8%。表 3 顯示 2021 年 12 月 31

A total of 632 bilingual press releases were issued over the course of the year and a large number of media enquiries were handled on a daily basis.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, press conferences and media briefings were organised for local, Mainland and foreign media.  Topics included the Connect schemes, financial technology (fintech) and the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\n\nTo engage and interact with the public in a timely manner, the HKMA maintains five social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube) with over 80,000 followers.  The HKMA utilises its social media channels to raise public awareness on a wide range of topics notably phishing scams, which increased significantly during the pandemic.  In addition, extensive promotion campaigns on green finance, fintech and the Connect schemes were conducted via social media to keep the public abreast of the latest development trends.\n\nMr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of HKMA, moderates a virtual panel discussion at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2021\n\nMr Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy\n\nMr Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, hosts a media briefing on the Hong Kong banking sector’s preparation for London Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nMr Edmond Lau, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA, conducts an interview with an international news channel\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand key HKMA functions and operations.  During 2021, it handled 9,781 enquiries. About half of them were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking issues, notes and coins, as well as financial infrastructure and debt market development. Some of the notable enquiries were about the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars and the Retail Bond Issuance Programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2018 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2021.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2021\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and it regularly updated the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. The HKMA also published 11 inSight1 articles to introduce its major new initiatives and policies and discuss topical issues of interest.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2020 received a Silver Award in the “Non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category, and an Excellence Award in Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting at the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2021 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# Corporate website\n\nThe corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 44,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\nThe HKMA has been releasing financial data and important information on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (API) in phases since 2018. By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","terms":{"developing":["發展"],"function":["職能"],"particular":["特別"],"9.6":["960"],"strong":["強"],"27":["27"],"highly":["高度"],"students":["學生"],"seize":["把握"],"use":["使用"],"co-ordinates":["統籌"],"safeguard":["保障"],"second":["第二"],"launch":["推出"],"’":[""],"maintain":["維持"],"relate":["有關"],"dedicated":["致力於"],"face":["面對"],"talk":["介紹"],"enhance":["提升"],"lingering":["持續的"],"recommendations":["建議"],"built":["建立"],"42":["42"],"maintaining":["維持"],"areas":["範疇"],"flexible":["靈活"],"serving":["服務"],"comprises":["包括"],"grow":["增長"],"began":["開始"],"sharp":["顯著"],"turn":["轉變"],"allowing":["讓"],"2017":["2017"],"participating":["參與"],"well":["良好"],"strengthening":["加強"],"aspects":["方面"],"outbreak":["爆發"],"adhere":["恪守"],"knowledge":["知識"],"based":["以⋯⋯為基礎"],"billion":["十億"],"track":["軌道"],"end":["年底"],"rougher":["崎嶇"],"get":["變得"],"lent":["提供"],"substantial":["大量"],"payment-related":["用作支付用途的"],"Looking":["展望"],"191.9":["1,919"],"December":["12月"],"mean":["意思是"],"mobilising":["引導"],"base":["基礎"],"brought":["帶來"],"need":["需要"],"Subsequently":["其後"],"Finally":["最後"],"seeking":["尋求"],"rollout":["推出"],"governments":["政府"],"mainly":["主要"],"double-digit":["雙位數"],"reduction":["減少"],"continue":["繼續"],"cement":["鞏固"],"entered":["踏入"],"demonstrated":["顯示"],"volatile":["波動"],"challenging":["充滿挑戰"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"providing":["提供"],"benefitting":["受惠"],"also":["亦"],"capture":["把握"],"premature":["過早"],"adding":["加上"],"tough":["艱難"],"committed":["致力"],"faring":["表現"],"aspires":["旨在"],"status":["地位"],"managing":["管理"],"parts":["部分"],"better":["更好"],"first":["首個"],"recovery":["復甦"],"equivalent":["等值"],"namely":["即"],"deteriorated":["惡化"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"4.1":["4.1"],"invite":["邀請"],"Despite":["儘管"],"severe":["嚴重"],"discussion":["討論"],"must":["必須"],"relevant":["相關"],"Meanwhile":["另一方面"],"successful":["成功"],"goes":["有云"],"marks":["標誌"],"increased":["上升"],"see":["見到"],"2050":["2050"],"solid":["穩健"],"past":["過去"],"together":["一同"],"real-time":["即時"],"formulated":["制定"],"pleased":["高興"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"Although":["儘管"],"90":["九成"],"effectively":["有效"],"maintained":["維持"],"ready":["準備就緒"],"vibrancy":["活力"],"years":["年"],"contraction":["收縮"],"point":["指出"],"may":["可能"],"changed":["改變"],"intensification":["升溫"],"prudently":["審慎"],"RMB26":["260億元人民幣"],"traded":["成交"],"increase":["上升"],"tap":["挖掘"],"two":["兩"],"year":["年"],"introduced":["推出"],"recover":["恢復"],"aligning":["呼應"],"groom":["培育"],"151.9":["151.9"],"journey":["旅程"],"future":["未來"],"adopting":["採納"],"set":["建立"],"continued":["繼續"],"increasingly":["日益"],"practical":["實用"],"go":["進行"],"pace":["步伐"],"launched":["推出"],"activity":["活動"],"emergence":["出現"],"extended":["延長"],"published":["發出"],"months":["個月"],"dominant":["主導"],"meeting":["滿足"],"established":["設立"],"throughout":["全"],"enhancing":["增強"],"Tackling":["處理"],"tCO2e\/US":["tCO2e"],"formulate":["制定"],"watch":["留意"],"series":["連串"],"strengthen":["加強"],"achieved":["達致"],"grew":["增長"],"promote":["推動"],"always":["一如既往"],"establishment":["設立"],"hard-pressed":["經營環境艱難"],"pressure":["壓力"],"five":["五"],"require":["需要"],"manage":["管理"],"87":["87%"],"enter":["進入"],"recorded":["錄得"],"revised":["修訂"],"power":["力量"],"cover":["涵蓋"],"trials":["測試"],"facilitate":["促進"],"closely":["緊密"],"concurrent":["同時"],"challenge":["挑戰"],"share":["分享"],"time":["時"],"tackle":["應對"],"guidance":["指引"],"degree":["程度"],"colleagues":["同事"],"reaching":["達到"],"quote":["舉例"],"diversifying":["多元化"],"50":["50"],"across":["橫跨"],"number":["數目"],"15.4":["15.4"],"covering":["涵蓋"],"cash-flow":["資金周轉"],"path":["路徑"],"resources":["資源"],"invest":["投資"],"organisation":["機構"],"outside":["境外"],"leveraging":["利用"],"twice":["兩度"],"six":["6"],"Besides":["此外"],"million":["百萬"],"numerous":["無數"],"completing":["完善"],"timely":["及時"],"capitalise":["把握"],"reaffirming":["重申"],"supporting":["支持"],"taking":["採取"],"feedback":["回饋"],"latter":["後者"],"ever":["曾"],"appropriate":["合適"],"fourfold":["四倍"],"facing":["面對"],"ultimately":["最終"],"comprehensively":["全面"],"kinds":["類"],"us":["我們"],"overnight":["一朝一夕"],"reflecting":["反映"],"reached":["達到"],"principle":["原則"],"testament":["見證"],"essentially":["本質上"],"including":["包括"],"developmental":["發展的"],"develop":["制訂"],"joined":["攜手"],"achievements":["成果"],"room":["空間"],"levels":["層面"],"help":["協助"],"vision":["願景"],"robustness":["穩健"],"recognising":["鑑於"],"quarter":["季度"],"proactive":["主動"],"city":["城市"],"helping":["幫助"],"assured":["保障"],"cycle":["循環"],"1983":["1983"],"128":["128"],"arising":["產生"],"adopt":["應用"],"huge":["巨大"],"milestone":["里程碑"],"worse":["惡化"],"prospect":["前景"],"spectrum":["範疇"],"disclose":["披露"],"grown":["發展"],"resurgence":["反彈"],"purchasing":["購買力"],"virtuous":["生生不息"],"footing":["基礎"],"start":["開始"],"still":["仍"],"connect":["聯繫"],"offers":["提供"],"ensure":["確保"],"fact":["事實"],"conviction":["信心"],"forefront":["領先"],"leveraged":["借助"],"attract":["吸引"],"jurisdiction":["地區"],"Enhancing":["提升"],"position":["地位"],"rise":["上升"],"totalling":["總額達"],"underpinned":["支撐"],"crucial":["至關重要"],"jointly":["聯同"],"generated

企業職能\n\n企業職能以高度的透明度、問責性、效率和專業精神支持香港金管局的運作。為促進公眾對其政策和運作的理解，香港金管局透過傳統媒體和社交媒體、其網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，保持與社會和市場的聯繫。對內，香港金管局認真建立靈活應變且可持續的員工隊伍，建立嚴格的財務紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以應對變化，確保其政策和舉措的有效實施。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n香港金管局與媒體緊密合作，以提升透明度及推動公眾對其政策及營運的理解。 於2021年，香港金管局舉辦或參與了169個實體及虛擬活動，包括八場新聞發佈會、八次即席訪問及153項其他公眾活動。 另外安排了27場媒體訪問。 整個年度共發佈了632篇雙語新聞稿，並且每日處理大量的媒體查詢。\n\n為提升香港金融管理局的主要主題 意識，我們為本地、內地及外地媒體 舉辦新聞發佈會及媒體簡報。 包括「聯繫」計劃、金融科技 (fintech) 以及利率指標改革。\n\n為及時與公眾保持聯繫及互動，香港金融管理局保持五個社交媒體頻道（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube），擁有超過八萬名關注者。香港金融管理局透過其社交媒體頻道提升公眾對廣泛主題的意識，尤其值得注意的是網絡釣魚騙案，疫情期間顯著上升。此外，透過社交媒體進行了廣泛的宣傳活動，主題包括綠色金融、金融科技及聯繫計劃，以讓公眾了解最新的發展趨勢。\n\n葉高培先生，金管局首席行政長官，主持了2021年香港金融科技周的虛擬討論。\n\n李達志先生，香港金管局副行政總裁，將主辦一場關於金管局「金融科技2025」策略的簡報會。\n\n阮國恒先生，香港金管局副行政長官，將主辦一場關於香港銀行業為倫敦銀行同業拆息過渡做準備的簡報會。\n\n劉先生，香港金管局副行政長官，接受一間國際新聞台的訪問。\n\n# 公共查詢\n\n公共查詢服務提供一種有效的方式，讓公眾能更好理解金管局的主要職能和運作。 於2021年，接獲共9,781宗查詢。 其中大約一半與銀行政策及法規、消費銀行問題、紙幣硬幣，以及金融基礎設施和債務市場發展相關。 一些值得關注的查詢涉及硬幣收數計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖一顯示自2018年以來公眾查詢的數目，圖二提供2021年的查詢性質分類。\n\n圖 1 公眾查詢總數目\n\n圖 2 查詢性質歡迎收到於 2021 年。\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了香港金管局年度報告外，香港金管局亦發出兩期半年貨幣及金融穩定局報告，以及四期季度通訊，並定期更新月度統計通訊，以提供關於香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題資訊和分析。香港金管局同時發出11期 inSight1 文章，以引入其主要新倡議和政策，並討論感興趣的時事議題。\n\n香港金管局二零二零年年報，於香港管理專業人員協會二零二一年最佳年報獎中，在「非牟利及慈善機構」類別中獲得銀獎，並在環境、社會及公司管治報告類別中獲得卓越獎。\n\n# 企業網站\n\n企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）載有超過四萬四千多頁的英文及傳統和簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取香港金管局（HKMA）最新資訊的途徑。網站維持著根據《銀行條例》第20部分列出的獲授權機構（AIs）及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及根據《支付系統及儲值易設施條例》列出的儲值易設施牌照持有人的登記冊，狀況良好。\n\n金管局自2018年以來，已透過開放的應用程式介面（API）分階段在其網站上發布金融數據及重要資訊。截至2021年底，金管局在其網站上開展了148組專項開放API，符合既定方針。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n香港金管局資訊中心設於國際金融中心兩座55樓，是一個重要的設施，向社會介紹金管局的工作，並推動公眾對貨幣及銀行事務的意識。它分為展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式簡介金管局的工作，以及香港的貨幣及銀行發展。它亦載有關於香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資訊及展品，供研究之用。圖書館，設於展覽區旁，收錄超過26,000本關於香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務，以及中央銀行主題的書籍、期刊及其他出版物。它亦保持人工智能及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及人工智能的證券從業員登記冊，供公眾查閱，符合《銀行條例》第20部分所需。\n\n為保障公眾健康與安全，在新冠疫情期間，資訊中心已訂下特殊營運安排。清潔消毒工作已加強，設施與展品亦定期以抗菌塗層進行消毒。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心之展覽區域包括政策部分、貨幣部分及歷史時間線。\n\n# 社區參與與公眾教育\n\n為向社會宣傳及提升大眾對香港金管局工作的意識，一項公眾教育項目自1998年以來日常運作。 2021年，金管局舉辦了一場網絡研討會，超過2,300名中學學生及教師參與，來自84所中學。 研討會內容包括金管局工作的簡介、聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、個人數字密匙的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的事業機會。 截至目前，已有超過63,000人參與了這項公眾教育項目。\n\n金管局致力教育大眾，並與公眾聯繫，讓大家成為精明且負責任的金融消費者。鑑於網絡釣魚詐騙案件上升，金管局進行了一項主題為「保障您的個人數字密碼；小心欺詐連結！」的公眾意識提升活動，透過各媒體宣傳，呼籲公眾暫停終止權，對來自銀行發送的手機短訊和郵件中的欺詐連結保持警惕。\n\n跨媒體宣傳，提醒公眾注意可疑的超連結。\n\n香港金管局亦尋求提升公眾對金融行業的理解，並提升年輕一代投身於該行業的興趣。 鑑於2020年網上劇集《加強》獲得正面的回饋，香港金管局推出了一部新劇集，題為《中區四方面人才》， 描劃了金融行業的四個越來越重要的範疇：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。 在這連串影片中，市場從業者的角色以幽默的方式被描劃，而經驗豐富的業界人士和年輕人才分享了關於以上四個範疇的性質和要求、事業機遇以及橫跨各方面的資訊。\n\n《中央四面人才》連串節目，讓年輕世代掌握金融市場的事業機會。\n\n“線上親子教育活動” 於 2020 年推出，並在 MarketingInteractive 的《2021 營銷活動獎》中獲得「最佳活動 — 企業社會責任」類別的銀獎。 憑藉此活動的良好成功，並以維持動力，香港市場營銷公會推出增加的舉措，包括一場親子財務教育工作坊，兒童教育專家分享了關於如何向孩子傳授良好金錢意義的技巧，並顯示了一款 DIY（自製）財務教育玩具，以及香港市場營銷公會資訊中心的動畫虛擬導覽。\n\n「線上育兒教育活動」在2021年行銷活動獎中獲得獎項。此活動推動金錢管理概念和技能，讓父母和孩子們以輕鬆有趣的方式學習。\n\n為提升在 中學 學生 之間 的 金融理財知識，金管局及 各種 持份者 合辦 了 “香港 金融理財知識錦標賽”，內容以金融科技為主題。除了 線上 測驗 之外，還 增加了一個 新 的 個人理財規劃 設計思考工作坊，以訓練 參與 的 學生 ，制訂 關於 資金管理 工具 的 創新 方案。 該 倡議 贏得了 éducation 局 下屬 的 商務院校合作計劃 頒發 的 “最高學生參與獎”，以及 投資者及金融教育議會2 (IFEC) 頒發 的 “投資者及金融教育獎（企業） — 金獎”。\n\n「香港金融理財知識錦標賽」向學生普及金融科技及設計思維概念，並創下創新高參與人數。\n\n其他社區參與活動包括為學生和退休人士舉辦講座或網絡研討會。香港金管局亦參與了教育局舉辦的關於經濟安全的教師培訓網絡研討會。提供用以使用自動提款機（ATM）的精明提示的線上教育資源，有八種語言版本，可獲得，以滿足居住在香港的各行各業的人士的需求。\n\n金管局支持香港金融教育基金 推動金融理財知識，並將探討與持份者進一步合作，以最大限度地提升社區參與的影響。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高透明度，金管局採納國際標準於財務披露，根據其適用於中央銀行營運的情況。此等標準包括香港財務匯報準則及其他適用之報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織之特殊數據發佈標準。財務部門與外部審計師及其他專業人士合作，按照香港財務匯報準則準備及呈現投資基金之財務報表。金管局亦提供詳細披露及廣泛的開支項目及預算信息之深入分析於其年度報告。\n\n# 問責性與管制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n一項香港金管局最重要的工作是管理貨幣和銀行系統的風險。風險管理既在日常運作的執行層面推行，也在高層次透過策略規劃來推行。在香港金管局的風險管理框架下，設有兩項高層次委員會——宏觀監察委員會和風險委員會，兩者均由香港金管局總裁擔任主席。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的條款如下：\n\n- 識別潛力風險及威脅，以應對香港貨幣及金融系統的相關風險，並討論可行措施；\n-

{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot

永續發展\n\n金管局正於其《2021年年報》中，發布首個可持續發展報告，作為其中一章，以闡述其在可持續發展方面的策略，並記錄其自身的努力，以及與金融業界共同努力，以支持政府的氣候策略，貢獻於一個更具韌性及可持續發展的世界。\n\n金管局將可持續發展的考慮融入其主要角色和職能橫跨各個方面，無論是以銀行監管、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，還是維持金融和貨幣穩定。此外，金管局與本地及海外同儕合作，加強氣候風險的管理和披露，以及發展綠色和可持續金融市場。\n\n此外，金管局致力履行其企業社會責任，目標是成為一個負責任且可持續的機構。此承諾體現在各種範疇，包括推動可持續、普及金融和環境友善的工作空間，支持廣大的社會，保護環境以及關愛工作空間。\n\n# 簡介\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的 最大 挑戰之一。為應對氣候變化，各國在《巴黎協定》下 同意 推行 措施以減少溫室氣體 (GHG) 排放，並最終在本世紀 爭取 實現碳中和。 滿足 《巴黎協定》氣候變化目標 需要 全球每年 估計 投入 1–2 萬億 美元，使 可持續性成為未來幾十年資本流的 最大 推動力。\n\n香港致力於此轉型的領先地位。政府公布將爭取在2050年前實現碳中和，呼應全球已發展經濟體的方針。香港亦是首個承諾於2025年前具體呼應氣候相關財務資訊披露工作小組（TCFD）建議，橫跨相關地區的建議。\n\n對金融部門而言，氣候變化既是風險也是機會。雖然金融部門無法倖免於氣候變化帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金導向與降低溫室氣體排放及具備氣候韌性的發展 接近 相關活動。\n\n金管局致力加強香港的金融系統，以支持更環保和可持續的未來，推動行動以支持政府的氣候目標，並作出貢獻於全球議程。 在此過程中，金管局將可持續發展的考量融入其主要職能和日常運作中。\n\n首個目標是加強銀行體系對氣候風險的韌性，並加速各銀行支持向低碳經濟轉型的努力。為達此目的，香港金管局已制定一套監管框架，其中載有銀行管理及披露氣候風險的監管要求。一項評估銀行業韌性的氣候風險壓力測試試驗也於2021年順利納入完成。 另一方面，香港金管局亦持續將氣候變化納入考量，以監測金融穩定風險。\n\n第二，在市場發展方面，香港金管局正聚焦其努力，以增強香港作為區域綠色和可持續融資中心的地位，包括大灣區（GBA）。香港作為內地的離岸金融中心，在引導全球投資於內地上實現2030年碳排放峰值和2060年碳中和的計劃方面，具有良好優勢。香港金管局亦透過綠色和可持續融資跨部門督導小組（CASG）3工作，該小組由聯席主席擔任，以構建行業能力，應對數據缺口，並探討本地綠色分類框架的發展。\n\n事實上，香港是綠色金融方案的領先者，首個已設立政府全球中期票據計劃，致力於政府綠色債券計劃項下的綠色債券發行，並自2019年以來，逐步擴大其發行的多樣性，無論是貨幣還是期限。為支持私營部門綠色及可持續債券和貸款的發行，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色及可持續金融資助計劃。由香港金管局管理，此計劃已鼓勵更多企業尋求香港的綠色及可持續融資，並鼓勵更多綠色顧問及外部審核員在此設立或擴大業務。\n\n第三，作為匯生銀行總經辦，金管局已 確保 環境、社會及管治 (ESG) 考慮因素為其投資流程及資產配置決策 的其中一章。在本報告的後者 其中一章，金管局作出 首份 公佈，內容為匯生銀行投資組合的氣候情景分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四點，金管局正提升自身綠色辦公室的舉措，以確保其運作符合氣候風險管理和減緩和的最佳實踐。作為開始，金管局已橫跨第一項和第二項排放範圍設立了碳排放檔案，並作出相關的披露。同時，金管局已實施措施以提升業界的營運效率並將資源消耗降至最低。此外，金管局對企業社會責任（CSR）抱持高標準，並與持份者合作推動金融理財知識和金融包容性。\n\n綠化金融體系需要中央銀行和監管機構之間的接近合作。香港金管局是國際社會積極的成員，在 globale 政策制定和可持續發展標準的協調方面發揮作用。香港金管局亦發布聲明，支持中央銀行和監管機構綠化金融體系網絡（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言5，重申其承諾落實 NGFS 建議，並採取必要措施促進更綠色的金融體系。\n\n為推動這些可持續發展倡議，並評估氣候相關的機會和風險，可持續發展和綠色考量已融入香港金管局的治理和風險管理框架中，領導層積極參與設定總體目標和原則，並在機構社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）及其下屬委員會的諮詢下進行。香港金管局的機構社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦評估可持續發展和氣候相關問題對機構的潛力影響，並制定策略以減低這些影響。相關策略和倡議的執行受到緊密監察，並定期向高級管理層報告。此外，已聘用外部顧問向香港金管局提供意見，就選定的範疇的工作提供協助。\n\n本章後續各節將深入探討香港金管局在各個角色中，進行綠色金融和可持續性工作的治理、策略和風險管理措施。\n\n本報告的編寫是參考了國際永續金融研討會（NGFS）於2021年12月發出之《氣候相關披露指引》中建議的披露要素。此外，與香港金管局辦公室運作相關的信息，廣泛參考了全球報告組織（GRI）標準6項下的報告原則以及香港交易所頒佈的ESG報告指引。\n\n# 中央銀行及監管機構綠色金融網絡\n\nNGFS 提供了一個平台，讓中央銀行和審慎監管機構交流經驗、分享最佳實踐、貢獻於金融部門環境和氣候風險管理發展，並動員主流融資以支持接近可持續經濟的轉型。 其目的在於界定並推動對內及境外 NGFS 會員的最佳實踐，並進行或委託綠色金融的分析工作。\n\n# 氣候相關財務揭露工作小組\n\n2015年12月，金融穩定性委員會設立TCFD，以制訂向投資者、貸款機構和保險承保人提供更有效氣候相關資訊的建議，從而能推動更具認識的決策。TCFD的建議圍繞著四個主題範疇，這些範疇代表了組織營運的四個核心要素：治理、策略、風險管理以及指標和目標。\n\n#

香港金管局的三個階段方案\n\n自2019年5月以來，香港金管局一直在推動綠色和可持續的銀行業，分三個階段進行。\n\n# 第一階段\n\n發展一套共通的框架來評估各銀行業的「綠色基礎線」，並與國際機構合作，提供技術支持予香港的銀行。\n\n# 階段（ii）\n\n諮詢業界及其他持份者，就綠色和永續性銀行業的監管期望和要求。\n\n# 階段（iii）\n\n聚焦於監管要求的落實，以及評估銀行在綠色和永續性銀行業的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 監管對氣候風險管理的規定\n\n在2020年，香港金管局與業界合作， разработала 共通框架，以評估各銀行體的「綠色基線」。香港金管局亦 進行 了首個綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為了 協助 銀行 準備 新 的監管要求，於2020年6月 發出 一份白皮書， 闡釋 了香港金管局對氣候風險管理監管期望的初步想法。\n\n2021年12月，在業界諮詢後，香港金管局發布了針對銀行將氣候因素納入公司治理、策略、風險管理和披露的監管要求。特別是，在建議的TCFD框架下，於2025年前強制進行與氣候相關的披露，並確立了具體要求和時間表。這些要求將建立一個基準，協助銀行提升其風險管理能力。\n\n下一步是金管局監察銀行對相關要求的執行。 針對此情況，金管局已加強其監察能力，在銀行監察部內設立了一個新團隊，致力於開展氣候風險監察。\n\n這個三階段方法是一個反覆的過程。 繼2020年進行的首個綠色評估輪迴後，金管局正檢視架構，以涵蓋氣候風險管理的新監管要求，並且有可能覆蓋更廣大的範圍，例如其他環境風險以及支持淨零轉型 的措施。 金管局計劃於2022年下半年推出更新後的架構。\n\n# 支持轉向碳中和的良好做法。\n\n除了融入氣候風險考量於風險管理框架外，部分銀行已致力投入資源並採取措施，以支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並貢獻於爭取全球淨零排放。香港金管局於2021年12月發布一份通告，與業界分享這些銀行的良好做法，這些做法對業界其他銀行制定氣候策略具有參考價值。這些良好做法被劃分為四個範疇：減少銀行自身運營的溫室氣體排放，透過投資組合調整減少融資排放，協助客戶轉型，以及推動集體努力，協助經濟爭取淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類架構以促進綠色資金流動。\n\n為提升金融市場的透明度並促進綠色金融政策的一致性，香港金管局正與其他金融監管機構合作，探討本地綠色分類框架，以促進在國際可持續金融平台 (IPSF)8 開發的《共同基礎分類法》(CGT) 與中國和歐盟所採用的綠色定義之間的操作，並在不同金融領域中採用。此項工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性原則為指引，同時考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地考量。此項倡議將減低綠色洗滌的風險，優化產品的可比性，最終提升投資者保護。\n\n# 氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行業應對氣候變化帶來的潛在衝擊的能力，金管局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）試驗，其中包括20家主要零售銀行和7家國際銀行集團的分行參與。一份總結試驗CRST結果的報告於2021年12月發出。結果顯示，儘管面對極端氣候相關衝擊，銀行業仍然具有韌性，但這些衝擊有可能能造成對銀行財務的重大不利影響。CRST試驗有助於提升銀行衡量和評估氣候風險的能力。鑑於CRST結果，參與銀行已制定計劃以加強其氣候策略和風險監管框架。金管局將繼續與業界保持聯繫，以加強銀行能力並提升CRST框架，同時採取從試驗中吸取的教訓。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of

匯生基金\n\n審計署審核外匯基金財務報表報告\n\n# 審計署 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 呈呈財政司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於頁217至319所載的財務報表，內容包括截至2021年12月31日的聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及該年內其收入及支出帳戶、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括重要的會計政策概要。\n\n鑑於我的意見，財務報表妥為提供基金及本集團截至2021年12月31日的財務地位，以及該年截至止的財務表現及現金流量的真實意見，並根據香港會計師公會頒佈的《香港財務報告準則》(“HKFRSs”)作出準備，並根據香港金融管理局長根據《金融管理局條例》(第66章)第7部分發出的指示妥為準備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我根據《交換基金條例》第7部分及審計總署的審計準則，進行了我的審計。根據這些準則，我有責任進一步描述在我的報告中，審計師就財務報表審計的意見部分。我符合這些準則，對該集團保持獨立，並且已根據這些準則履行了我其他的道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足以作出我的意見，並提供一個基礎。\n\n# 審核重點\n\n關鍵審核事項是指，根據我的專業判斷，於截至2021年12月31日的財務報表審核中，最具重要性的事項。 這些事項是在我對財務報表整體審核的背景下處理的，並且在形成我的意見時也考慮了這些事項，我不會就這些事項提供個別的意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債之公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註 2.5、2.6 和 38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，集團的金融資產總額達4百萬港元，金融負債總額達1150萬8610港元，按公允價值估值。\n\n對於這 89% 的金融資產和所有金融負債，其公允價值均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一層輸入），或為使用估計技術，並以可觀察市場數據為基礎的估計值（第二層輸入）。\n\n對於這批金融資產餘下 11%，其公允價值估計是用以價值評估技術，而這些技術的輸入並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第三級輸入）。 這些金融資產總值為 港元 517,316 百萬，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於大量及相關估計，以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債，是本次審計中的重要議題。\n\n審核程序包括對以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債。\n\n- 了解評估不同類別金融資產及金融負債的程序，包括相關控制。\n- 評估及測試控制，包括電腦系統的相關應用。\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的評估、存在性、權利及義務及完整性取得外部確認。\n- 若有運用報價市場價格，則核實價格至獨立資料來源。\n- 若有運用以⋯⋯為基礎於可觀察市場數據的評估技術，評估評估方法之合理性及假設之合理性，並核實數據至獨立資料來源。\n- 若有運用以未以可觀察市場數據為基礎的評估技術，評估評估方法之合理性及假設及數據之合理性。\n\n# 投資物業按公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表上的註記2.11、18和19。\n\n集團的投資物業已按公允價值列帳，截至2021年12月31日，總額達港元27,089百萬。集團亦持有聯營公司一間及合營公司二十一間，總額達港元45,172百萬，其主要業務是持有海外投資物業。這些投資物業的公允價值，無論是由集團直接持有，或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，主要以估值制定，由獨立專業估值師進行。此等估值涉及重大判斷和估計，包括估值方法及運用之假設。\n\n審核投資物業按公允價值作估值的程序包括：\n\n獲取並檢視本集團直接或通過聯營公司所持投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值是以估值報告中列帳的估值為基礎；\n評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；\n評估估值方法是否恰當，以及假設和輸入的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣監理處負責其他資料。該等其他資料包括香港貨幣監理處二零二一年年報內的所有資料，但除財務報表及我的審計師報告外，不包括其他內容。\n\n我的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且我不對此類資訊表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中取得的知識有實質性不一致之處，或以其他方式顯著失實。若我基於已執行的工作結論，認為該其他資訊存在重大錯報，我須報告該事實。在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 金融管理局及投資基金審核委員會之委員會審核財務報表的職責\n\n貨幣審定委員會負責編製財務報表，內容需鑑於香港財務匯報準則及香港會計師公會頒佈的準則，以及根據《流通資金條例》第7節由行政長官作出的指示，作出真實而公平的呈述，並就貨幣審定委員會認為為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤而必要的內部控制負責，並提供相關的內部控制。\n\n在準備財務報表時，貨幣監察局負責評估集團持續經營的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，用以採用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計師就審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是取得關於整體財務報表是否免受重大錯報影響的合理保證，無論是部分由於欺詐或錯誤所致，並發行一份包含我的審計師意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高程度的保證，但不能保證一如既往地，在審計按照審計委員會的審計準則進行時，能偵測到已存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源於欺詐或錯誤，並且如果個別或總體上，合理預期會影響基於這些財務報表所做的用戶的經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為審計準則審計的其中一章，我運用專業判斷，並全過程保持懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n識別及評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是部分由於欺詐或錯誤，設計並執行對應於這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且合適的審計證據，以提供作出我的意見的基礎。因欺詐所導致未發現重大錯誤的風險，高於因錯誤所導致的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n對內了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計在情況下合適的審計程序，但並非為了表達對集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n評估所使用會計政策的合理性，以及貨幣機關所作出的會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n就貨幣機關使用持續經營會計基礎的合理性作出結論，並根據取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的活動或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我須在審計師報告中對財務報表中的相關披露事項提出注意，或若此等披露不充分，則修改我的意見。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日期的審計證據。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團無法繼續持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以一種實現公允表達的方式反映了基礎交易和活動；以及\n取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務信息，以表達對財務報表的意見所需的足夠且合適的審計證據。我對群體審計的指導、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任。\n\n我與聯匯基金諮詢委員會的委員會，就包括審計範圍和時間在內的多項事宜進行溝通，以及重要的審計結果，包括我在審計過程中識別到的任何重要的內部監控制缺失。\n\n我亦向投資基金審查委員會的委員會提供聲明，證明我已遵守就獨立性而言的相關倫理要求，並向其溝通所有可能被認為與我的獨立性有關係的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n從與聯匯基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會的聯繫中，我釐定於本當前期間財務報表審計中，最為重要的事項，因此這些事項是關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我認為將事項在報告中聯繫會產生負面後果，而這些後果合理預期會超過公開聯繫所帶來的公共利益福利。\n\n卓
