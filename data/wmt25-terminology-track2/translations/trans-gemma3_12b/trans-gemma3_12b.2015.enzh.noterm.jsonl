{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n二零一五年，香港經濟增長放緩，反映了本地需求疲弱以及出口表現不佳。預計二零一六年經濟增長仍將維持低迷，原因是外部環境挑戰嚴峻，金融市場狀況脆弱。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港的經濟增長在年內有所放緩，實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長率從2014年的2.6%降至2.4%（見表1）。 這是反映本地需求擴張溫和，儘管淨出口回歸成為GDP增長的正面貢獻，原因是總進口下降速度快於總出口（見圖1）。 儘管經濟表現平平，勞工市場大致保持穩定，失業率維持在約3.3%的低位。 通脹進一步減緩，原因是本地成本和進口價格的壓力有所消退。 本地股市在國際金融市場波動加劇的情況下出現大幅波動。 住宅物業市場在二月份宣布第七輪審慎措施後開始降溫，年末房屋價格進一步顯示出整合的跡象。\n\n圖一 實際本地生產總值增長分項貢獻\n資料來源：香港政府統計處\n\n表一 實質 GDP 增長（按支出構成劃分）（環比）\n\n就固定資本形成總額的季節調整後按季變化率，目前沒有數據。\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，香港在2015年維持了匯率穩定，港元匯率一直維持在每美元7.75元附近。由於股票相關的資金流入，於四月份觸發了強方可兌換保證計劃，其後又於九月和十月因離岸人民幣兌換港元以及部分商業對港元的需求而再次觸發。 由於集體結餘擴大，本地利率持續保持低水平，而金管局基礎利率則在12月中旬美國加息後，從0.5%上調至0.75%。 由於信貸需求疲軟，銀行業的貸款總增長率進一步放緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%有所下降。 銀行業的整體貸款質素略有下降，但不良貸款比率仍維持在低水平。\n\n# 國內需求\n\n二零一五年，國內需求增長速度放緩。儘管就業和收入狀況大致穩定，持續提供支撐，但消費者信心疲弱以及資產價格調整在當年下半年抑制了民間消費增長。然而，由於上半年相對強勁的增長勢頭，全年月增長率較去年同期上升至4.8%，而二零一四年為3.3%。政府消費則略為加快，增長3.4%。事實上，國內需求增長放緩的主要原因是固定資本形成總額下降2.2%（見圖2）。民間部門的機器設備採購連續第二年萎縮，反映出商務信心惡化，而建築和施工活動也呈現出較弱的增長勢頭，與公共項目進展放緩相伴。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年惡化（見圖3）。商品出口錄得普遍性的1.7%下降，是自2009年以來首次出現。對日本和歐盟的出口下降，而對美國的出口則幾乎沒有增長。來自這些先進市場的疲弱總需求也對區域工業活動和區域內貿易造成壓力。結果，香港對中國內地、新加坡、南韓和台灣的出口也因這些經濟體的總需求和中間需求疲弱而減少。香港的服務出口持續從早期的高增長軌道放緩，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的下降，主要原因是入境旅遊放緩。商品進口也隨著國內需求和出口誘發需求走弱而下降。相反，由於本地居民強烈的旅遊興趣，服務進口增長加速。從淨值來看，總貿易盈餘在2015年略有改善，對GDP增長產生了適度的正面貢獻。\n\n圖表 2 國內需求\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n2015年，基礎通脹持續降溫，原因是本地成本壓力溫和，以及進口價格通脹減少。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，基礎通脹率從2014年的3.5%下降至2.5%（見圖4）。經濟活動溫和，勞工成本壓力保持穩定，而商業和工業租金成本壓力則有所緩解，尤其是在下半年。由於全球商品價格下跌以及港幣匯率強勁，進口價格壓力減退，食品通脹亦維持低水平。由於先前季度新租房的影響較為溫和，通脹中的租金成分得以控制。\n\n圖3 貨物及服務出口\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n圖四 隱藏的消費者物價膨脹\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n二零一五年勞工市場狀況維持穩定。勞工需求持續支持，儘管貿易及旅遊相關行業的就業人數下降，但其他商業領域的穩健招聘步伐已大致抵消了此影響，導致總就業人數較一年前增加百分之十三點三。勞工供應亦增加百分之十三點三，經季節調整後的失業率全年維持在約百分之三點三左右（見圖五）。 鑒於勞工市場依然緊張，名義勞工收入在年首三季上升百分之四點七，較一零一四年增長百分之四點三。 隨著通脹壓力減緩，實際勞工收入在年首三季增加百分之一點三，較一零一四年錄得百分之零點一的下降。\n\n# 股市\n\n香港股市在劇烈外部環境變動下，經歷了一年波動性較高的年份。第一季表現平平，但隨著內地A股市場氣勢強勁以及資金流入，本地股市在第二季呈現復甦。恒生指數在四月份飆升至七年高位，滬港通的每日額度首次出現額滿情況（見圖6），這是自2014年11月滬港通開通以來首次。然而，自六月底起，本地市場開始反轉，恒生指數下跌28%，至九月份創下年內新低，原因是內地A股市場和全球股市出現拋售，全球外匯市場波動加劇，以及國際商品價格疲軟。在市場全球及內地金融市場穩定後，香港股市在最後一個季度有所回升。 總體而言，2015年恒生指數錄得下跌7.2%，為自2011年以來最差的表現，而平均每日成交額則從2014年的695億港元上升至1056億港元。 儘管融資活動在下半年有所放緩，但本地股市籌集到的股本資金總額仍從一年前的9427億港元增至11156億港元。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場出現整合跡象。在2015年初經歷一段繁榮期後，隨著二月份公布第七輪審慎措施，住宅物業市場有所降溫。由於房價增幅放緩，並在去年第四季開始下降，2015年全年房價的累積增長為2.5%，低於2014年的13.5%增幅（見圖6）。同期，交易量較去年同期下降12.3%，錄得55,982宗，其中二手市場的交易活動在下半年顯著減少。投機性交易，包括確認交易和短期倒手交易，持續維持低水平。儘管如此，家庭可負擔能力仍然吃緊，價格收入比率達致15.7，收入負擔比率遠高於長期平均水平。商業及工業物業市場在上半年表現暢旺，但其後交易活動有所降溫，在去年第四季，價格和租金均錄得下跌。租金回報率與去年同期大致相同，並維持在歷史低位附近。\n\n圖六 資產價格\n資料來源：地政總署及香港交易所及結算所。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n二零一六年香港的經濟增長預料將持續溫和。 私營機構分析員預測，經濟平均增長率將放緩至一·七百分比，而政府則預測增長將落在一至百分之二之間。 具體而言，全球經濟增長前景不明朗、內地旅遊持續疲弱，以及全球金融市場動盪帶來的負面影響，將持續抑制香港的出口表現。 內地方面，預期私人消費將溫 moderate 度增長，原因是就業市場或將面臨一些壓力，經濟增長勢頭疲弱，而本地資產價格調整可能會削弱消費者信心，並引發負面的財富效應。 建築及地盤工程活動或可維持，但經營氣氛低迷和利率上升將會對私人資本投資構成壓力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n預計2016年通貨膨脹壓力將會保持可控。進口價格壓力預計將持續溫和，而國內成本壓力則預期將會溫和， وذلك 在溫和的經濟增長勢頭帶動下。通貨膨脹中的租金成分，也可能因應2015年底新簽訂房屋租賃壓力減緩而有所下降。市場普遍預期2016年的整體通脹率為2.5%，而政府預測其核心通脹率為2.0%。勞工市場也可能因入境旅遊放緩以及出口部門持續低迷而略微軟化。私人部門分析師目前預期2016年的失業率將上升至3.5%。\n\n# 不確定因素與風險\n\n二零一六年經濟前景充滿不確定因素及風險。尤其，美國利率進一步上升的步伐、全球增長前景以及商品價格的波動，將繼續成為主要的影響因素。任何重大不利發展都可能加劇全球金融市場及國際資本流動的波動，進而收緊本地貨幣及金融環境，並對香港的增長前景投下陰影。這些外部因素對本地經濟的影響，將取決於它們對物業市場的影響，透過財富效應及資產負債表效應而定。儘管物業市場正面對源於全球及本地金融市場疲弱、美國利率正常化以及房屋供需差距收窄等因素而日益增加的下行風險，但仍需更多時間以確定物業市場是否已步入下行周期。雖然物業市場的急劇調整可能會對整體經濟構成重大阻力，但過去幾年實施的逆周期宏觀審慎措施及其他監管措施，已顯著提升香港銀行體系的抗風險能力。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管先進經濟體貨幣政策持續分化，以及新興市場經濟體風險不斷累積，香港銀行業在年內仍保持穩健。持牌金融機構的流動性狀況持續保持良好，而本地註冊的持牌金融機構則資本充足。零售銀行資產質素略為下降，但仍維持在健康水平。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n配合美國美元利率，香港港幣銀行同業利率全年在低位徘徊。根據複合利率的下降趨勢，零售銀行的人幣資金成本在年初下降，下半年則維持穩定（見圖7）。\n\n圖表 7 HIBOR 基準利率、綜合利率及最佳貸款利率 (BLR)\n備註：\n1.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管金融市場波動劇烈，且美國聯邦儲備局於十二月啟動升息周期，香港元匯率在2015年全年大致保持穩定。貨幣市場持續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。作為過去幾十年來香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度持續展現出高度的抗外部衝擊能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定定義為香港幣對美元的外部匯率在匯率市場上維持於港幣7.75至7.85元兌一美元的區間內。貨幣體系的結構特點是金管局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少以100%的美元儲備在匯儲基金中備抵，並且貨幣基礎的變動必須完全與匯儲基金中美元儲備的相應變動相符。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表1）包括\n\n* 債務憑證，為三家發鈔銀行發行的紙幣提供全面擔保。\n* 流通中的政府發行的票據和硬幣。\n* 集體結餘，指各銀行在香港金管局保留的清算賬戶餘額總和。\n* 香港金管局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及票息憑證。\n\n香港法定金幣的匯率穩定，乃透過自動調整利率的機制，以及金管局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）而維持。當對香港法定金幣的需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至每美元七點七五港元的強方聯繫匯率限額時，金管局隨時準備向銀行出售香港法定金幣，換取美元。此時，集資結餘將擴大，以降低香港法定金幣的利率，從而營造貨幣環境，使香港法定金幣遠離強方限額，並維持於七點七五至七點八五的浮動匯率範圍內。相反，若香港法定金幣的供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至每美元七點八五港元的弱方聯繫匯率限額時，金管局將向銀行買入香港法定金幣。此時，集資結餘將收縮，以提高香港法定金幣的利率，使香港法定金幣遠離弱方限額，並維持於浮動匯率範圍內。\n\n本報告所列的債務憑證及流通中的政府發行紙幣和硬幣，均以香港元面值列示。本年度報告中，信託基金資產負債表所列對應項目，則以等值於其贖回時，於資產負債表日適用匯率換算後的美元金額列示。此安排符合香港普遍採用之會計原則。\n\n本報告中顯示的聯邦債券（EFBN）金額，與交易基金在本年報中的資產負債表所示金額不同。 根據香港一般公認的會計準則，香港金管局代表交易基金在次級市場交易聯邦債券所持有的聯邦債券，將被抵銷已發行的聯邦債券，並將淨額記錄在資產負債表中。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015 回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n二零一五年，香港 dollar 兌美元的匯率大致保持穩定，在 7.7500 至 7.7657 之間窄幅波動（見圖1）。二零一五年年初，由於市場關注美國利率上升，港 dollar 面臨輕微貶值壓力。然而，在第二季，港 dollar 匯率走強，接近 7.75，由於股市活動暢旺，相關股票需求激增，導致強方聯繫匯率制度多次被觸發。進入下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著下跌，全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動加劇，港 dollar 匯率在八月份仍維持在 7.75 附近，與美元匯率相持。受離岸人民幣兌換成港 dollar 的影響，強方聯繫匯率制度在九月和十月再次被觸發。儘管美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）在十二月中旬將聯邦基金利率目標區間上調 25 個基點，港 dollar 相對美元的匯率仍維持在狹窄區間內，未見顯著資金外流。總體而言，儘管全球金融市場動盪，二零一五年香港 dollar 匯市運作暢順。\n\n圖一 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於強方聯繫匯率機制於四月、九月及十月多次啟動，香港金管局根據聯繫匯率制度，從銀行購買合共293億美元，並以2272億港元交換。此舉導致集體結餘相應擴大，部分擴大則因應銀行對流動資金管理需求強勁，而透過額外發行發行基金票據來抵消（見圖2）。 額外發行發行基金票據符合聯繫匯率制度，因為它代表了貨幣基礎的組成結構轉變，而貨幣基礎完全以外匯儲備支持。截至2015年底，集體結餘、未償發行基金票據及票據總額增至12210億港元，較前一年的9925億港元增加。\n\n圖表 2 2015 年總結餘額及金管局發行證券未結餘\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n受益於銀行體系充裕的流動性，香港銀行同業利率於2015年全年維持低水平。 隨著美國聯邦基金利率目標區間於12月16日（美國時間）由0-0.25%上調至0.25-0.5%，香港金管局根據預先訂定的公式，於12月17日將基準利率亦上調至0.75%。 2015年全年，隔夜至三個月期銀行同業利率均低於基準利率（見圖3），並受到銀行季節性流動資金需求以及八月份金融市場波動導致流動性收緊的影響，出現溫和波動。 香港銀行同業拆息利率（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息利率（LIBOR）的利差大致同步變動，八月份因市場流動性收緊，香港元遠期點數轉為顯著溢價，年末則因美元利率普遍上漲而轉為折價（見圖4）。 總體而言，貨幣市場持續正常運作。 貼現窗借款活動不踴躍，全年僅錄得28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖3 2015年香港銀行同業利率\n\n圖四 2015年香港 dollar 遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自一九八三年創立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直運作暢順，並在過去幾十年中對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻。 鑒於香港經濟規模細小且開放，以及其作為國際金融中心的地位，聯繫匯率制度仍然是香港最適合的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅定不移地承諾維持聯繫匯率制度。 誠然，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的可信度，而公眾對港元作為支付工具及價值儲存手段的信心持續強勁。 在二零一五年與香港的第四次諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續肯定聯繫匯率制度是香港最佳的貨幣安排，並引用香港穩健的制度、法律及政策框架，充裕的財政儲備，靈活的市場以及健全的金融體系，作為支持聯繫匯率制度順利運作的主要因素。\n\n鑒於穩健的銀行體系對優質流動性提升機制（LERS）的正常運作至關重要，金管局持續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強了對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管力度，以提升銀行業的韌性。 考慮到美國利率上升，金管局提醒公眾做好風險管理所需準備，並指出，弱方聯繫匯率機制觸發及香港 dollar 流出，是香港 dollar 利率正常化的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為提高聯繫銀行帳戶的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將一筆特定的投資基金資產撥作支持貨幣基礎。在2015年，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在106.3%至107.5%的窄幅範圍內，未觸及上浮或下浮觸發點。截至十二月三十一日，該比率報106.3%（見圖5）。在聯繫匯率制度下，儘管已指定特定的投資基金資產作為支持投資組合，但所有投資基金資產均可支持港元匯率。該基金龐大的財政資源，能在突發衝擊事件中為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的保障。\n\n圖5 2015年支撐比率的每日波動\n\n# 其他活動\n\n香港金融管理局聯繫基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣基金委員會，負責監察及審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的事項。於二零一五年，該委員會審視了包括全球銀行國際美元貸款供應、國際宏觀審慎措施的使用、美國利率上升對香港物業市場的影響、一按利率的釐定公式、香港法定實效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的信貸風險等議題。該委員會的討論記錄及呈報給委員會的貨幣基金營運報告，均已刋載於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行和金融領域的研究。 於二零一五年，該中心接待了16名研究員，並發布了27篇工作論文。\n\n該研究所共舉辦了五場國際會議和研討會。主要包括：\n\n一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟學術研討會，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定：中國與國際經驗」。會議匯報了11篇高品質的研究論文，涵蓋了企業槓桿、中國信貸繁榮與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定、以及銀行監管與信貸供應等廣泛議題。\n五月舉辦的香港財務研究中心（HKIMR）與香港大學合辦的「HKIMR-香港大學國際金融、機構與經濟增長學術研討會」。會議涵蓋了諸多不同的經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n十月由香港財務研究中心（HKIMR）、美國聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲中央銀行和達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行合辦的學術研討會，主題為「分化的貨幣政策、全球資本流動與金融穩定」。會議探討了諸如貨幣政策、國際資本流動與匯率之間的關係、分化的貨幣政策及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策向世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益等廣泛議題。\n\n該研究所於八月份舉辦了第十三屆香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）夏季研討會，並於九月份舉辦了第十三屆香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）中國內地經濟論壇，探討了中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。研討會和論壇吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業和全球中央銀行等領域的參與者。此外，該研究所全年還舉辦了二十四場公開講座，涵蓋了廣泛的經濟、貨幣和金融議題。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n截至2015年底，流通紙幣總值為3602億港元，較前一年增長5.3%（見圖6、7及8）。政府發行的紙幣和硬幣總值為112億港元，上升2.9%（見圖9及10）。流通中的政府發行10港元紙幣總值為40億港元，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n金管局將監管重點放在持牌金融機構的風險管治上，包括信貸及流動資金風險管理系統、反洗錢及打擊恐怖分子融資的控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售手法。 隨著系統性風險的累積，金管局宣布自2016年1月1日起，香港實施0.625%的議息資本緩衝比率（2017年1月1日起為1.25%）。 五間持牌金融機構被指定為本地系統重要金融機構，將需遵守較高的損失吸收資本緩衝比率。 在恢復及重組改革方面取得了顯著進展，已將《金融機構重組條例》草案提交立法會。 金管局同時加強與銀行業界合作，提升基本銀行服務的可及性、加強消費者教育，以及提升銀行董事及金融從業員的技能和知識。\n\n# 2015 回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要已開發經濟體貨幣政策立場出現分歧的跡象下，新興市場於2015年面臨更高的資本外流及經濟增長放緩的風險。為維持銀行體系在可能出現宏觀經濟環境急劇惡化的情況下的韌性，香港金管局持續密切監察持牌金融機構（AIs）的風險管治及信貸及流動資金風險管理系統的有效性。\n\n# 營運監督\n\n二零一五年，香港金管局繼續採用監察方法，在定期現場審核的基礎上，增加主題審查的數量。主題審查是對特定風險範疇或所選金融機構特定活動進行的深入離地審查。 這種方法使香港金管局能夠將監察資源優先用於應對金融機構出現的新興及更重要的風險。\n\n年內，金管局共進行了193項現場審查。鑒於金融機構貸款資產質素出現惡化跡象，金管局加強了針對信貸風險管理及資產質素的深入主題現場審查。 由於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策分化，市場充滿不確定性，金管局亦增加了對與庫務相關活動的審查次數。此外，金管局還對與內地業務、壓力測試、流動資金風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）控制以及金融機構內部評級法（IRB）模型進行了現場審查。 年內，由專業團隊對金融機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行了現場審查。\n\n此外，共進行了152場主題性離地審查，覆蓋範圍與主題性現場審查相似。第一表詳述了營運監管工作的細節。\n\n二零一五年，進行了196項離地盤審查，以評估人工智能公司的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運營。監管部門的關注重點是風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸以及巴塞爾三標準的落實情況。監管團隊與所選人工智能公司的董事會及外部審計師保持頻繁聯繫。舉行了20場與人工智能公司高級管理層及外部審計師的三方會議，並與所選人工智能公司的全體董事會或董事會委員會舉行了23場會議。\n\n銀行監管審查委員會審議了四宗案件，均涉及人工智能的授權事宜。\n\n為更有效地運用監管資源應對各項優先事項，香港金管局持續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條賦予的權力，要求持牌銀行委聘外部審計師跟進可能構成重大監管問題。香港金管局於2015年根據該條文委聘了六份報告，其中兩份涵蓋洗錢及反恐怖融資的監控措施，另外兩份涵蓋私人銀行業務，其餘的則與證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等範疇有關。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n二零一五年，沒有人工智能系統違反了與資本充足率或流動性比率相關的《銀行條例》規定。雖然有84宗違反《銀行條例》各項條文的個案，但均未影響存款人的利益，並且已由相關人工智能系統迅速糾正。\n\n表一 營運監控\n\n# 《銀行條例》第五十二條賦予的權力\n\n花旗銀行股份有限公司持續受到《銀行條例》第五十二條賦予的權力管轄。貨幣按察局於二零零八年六月二十五日根據《銀行條例》第五十二條(1)(A)分部就花旗銀行股份有限公司香港分行事務、業務及財產所施加的指示，於本年度內仍然生效。香港金融管理局將繼續與相關部門保持定期溝通，監察與該分行及其位於英國總行有關的發展，並將密切關注為保障人工智能存款人的利益而採取的監管措施。\n\n# CAMEL 評級審核\n\n審查委員會審閱並確定了各人工智能系統的綜合CAMEL評級。這些人工智能系統已獲悉其評級，並有權要求重新審查。年內並未收到任何重新審查的請求。\n\n# 專業監督工作\n\n# 作業及科技風險的監督\n\n金管局持續就營運及科技風險管理發布新的或更新的指引，以應對新興風險及行業發展。 尤其，金管局已完成有關電子銀行（網上銀行）的《監察政策手冊》（SPM）編章的修訂，讓持牌銀行在提供新的網上銀行服務方面擁有更大的彈性。 此外，金管局亦發布了關於網絡安全的通告，重申持牌銀行董事會及高級管理層對有效網絡安全風險管理進行監察的重要性。 金管局同時定期發布《營運事故監察》刊物，重點介紹所選欺詐個案或營運事故的作案手法，以及識別出的監控漏洞。\n\n金管局已進行基於風險的審核性主題現場及離場審查，以評估所選人工智能（AI）在企業層面或特定業務部門的營運及科技風險管理。 這些審查涵蓋了與人工智能營運風險管理框架、網絡安全風險管理、防止異常交易活動的監控、對重要外包服務供應商的監察、欺詐風險管理以及反洗錢科技監控等選定領域。 這些審查補充了年度獨立合規審核，涵蓋營運風險管理框架、科技風險管理（包括客戶數據保護）及業務持續性計劃，根據此要求，所選人工智能必須委聘獨立且具資歷的評核人員，審查其相關監控的充分性，並糾正所發現的不足之處。 金管局亦識別並分析了人工智能的營運及科技風險趨勢及主要監察重點，尤其關注在香港貨幣及銀行體系穩定及有效運作中扮演重要角色的相關人工智能。\n\n金管局監察了銀行業晶片式自動櫃員機技術的最終推行階段，確認各持牌銀行已於2015年底完成純信用卡更換程序。金管局同時要求發卡機構加強實施身份驗證措施，進一步提升「離線交易」信用卡交易的安全性。另外，接獲有報告顯示部分非接觸式信用卡儲存的持卡人姓名可能被隱藏方式存取後，金管局要求相關持牌銀行立即採取行動，通知並保障受影響的持卡人。金管局亦投放資源，向公眾宣傳說明事件的規模及影響，以舒緩公眾疑慮，並監察持牌銀行為糾正問題所作的努力，包括盡快更換受影響的信用卡。\n\n金管局與業界及其他持份者合作，推行了一系列措施，包括公眾宣傳電子銀行安全注意事項的計劃、建立網絡安全情報分享平台，以及為香港金融服務業務持續管理論壇舉辦的危機管理演習提供支持和建議，該演習涉及人工智能及其他金融機構。\n\n# 審視財富管理及強積金相關業務\n\n金管局與香港其他金融監管機構緊密合作，就人工智能（AI）銷售證券、投資產品、保險產品及強積金計劃提供指引及監察。透過雙邊及多邊會議，以及在金融管理局的贊助下，定期保持與監管機構的聯繫。這些會議涵蓋了涉及金融機構或受規管實體在金融服務行業不同領域內密切業務關係的各種問題，以確保更協調和有效的監管行動。\n\n年內，金管局已進行二十五項現場及非現場審查，並對一間授權機構進行十五項非現場監察。 這些審查涵蓋投資產品銷售、證券交易結算及客戶證券之安全保管，以及面向零售、私人銀行及企業銀行客戶的非人壽長期保險（NLTI）產品及強積金相關產品的銷售。\n\n八月份，香港金管局發出通知予保險從業員，就向客戶銷售非本地投資產品的合適度評估及產品資料披露提供指引。此指引旨在協助從業員遵守監管標準，包括保險監管處及香港保險從業員協會於七月發布的相關要求。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n金管局持續與金融服務及財富管理局（財富局）在保險公司（2014年修訂）法案的立法過程中緊密合作，以設立獨立的保險監察局及為保險中介引入法定牌照制度。七月，立法會通過了《保險公司（2015年修訂）條例》，當中規定，就保險從業員的保險中介業務，金管局可透過授權執行檢查及調查權。\n\n金管局已處理了六宗成為註冊機構（RI）的申請，以及一宗RI從事額外受規管活動的申請。 亦已批准了204名負責監察RI證券業務的高級人員，並對RI提交予金管局以納入其維護名冊的9,697名個人進行了背景審查。\n\n# 庫務監督\n\n人工智能的流動性風險管理仍然是香港金管局的首要監管重點，尤其是在美國利率預期回歸正常以及隨後可能出現資金流動逆轉，並可能影響人工智能流動性狀況的背景下。 整個2015年，香港金管局持續實施加強的人工智能穩定資金要求，以確保其擁有足夠的穩定資金支持其貸款業務。 自2015年1月1日起實施《巴塞爾III》流動性保障比率（LCR）以來，香港金管局一直監測第一類金融機構的LCR水平和趨勢，這些機構普遍維持LCR在100%或以上，遠高於2015年按逐步實施安排規定的法定最低要求60%。\n\n此外，金管局亦有就選定金融機構的風險管理架構，對其管理預期利率正常化相關風險進行了主題現場審查。在市場波動的背景下，金管局亦密切關注市場的突變及其對銀行體系以及個別金融機構的影響，並採取了適當的後續行動。\n\n# 主管主導的壓力測試計畫\n\n金管局持續推行由監管機構主導的自下而上的壓力測試計劃，以更深入地了解本地註冊零售銀行在極端和不利經濟狀況下的韌性，並鼓勵它們制定應對壓力時期潛在問題的計劃。 過去一年，為收集更詳細的信息，以更深入地了解所選範疇的風險動態，引入了若干改進。 金管局分析了參與機構提交的結果，並與它們討論如何進一步完善其壓力測試流程。\n\n# 信用風險管理與資產品質\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n自二〇一五年下半年起，之前幾年來觀察到的強勁信貸增長趨勢已趨緩。全年而言，銀行業的總放款增長了百分之三點五，較二〇一四年百分之十二點七的增長幅度有所下降（見表二）。由於客戶存款增長速度快於銀行放款，截至二〇一五年底，整體貸款與存款比率降至百分之七十點一，較一年前的百分之七十二點二有所降低。"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based series.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n二零一五年是全球金融市場動盪不安的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未有的挑戰。在如此充滿挑戰和艱難的投資環境下，投資基金錄得一零點六%的總投資回報，但其虧損相較於主要市場指數及同類投資基金而言，相對溫和。這主要歸功於香港金管局過去幾年實施的一系列防禦措施，有效提升了投資基金的韌性。\n\n# 基金交換\n\n據《金融管理局條例》規定，金融管理局的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港的貨幣匯率。該基金亦可被用作維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定及健全，以協助維護香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金融管理局由財政司長監管，並可投資於財政司長認為適當的任何證券或其他資產，投資決策需諮詢金融管理局諮詢委員會（EFAC）。\n\n# 投資基金之管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n聯邦元基金已設定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 維護資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎在任何時候均能完全以高流動性美元計價資產支持；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 考量 (a) 至 (c) 之規定，以達成有助於維護基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標完全顧及投資基金的法定職能，並已納入基金的投資組合架構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n廣泛來說，外匯基金擁有兩個主要投資組合，分別是支持性投資組合和投資性投資組合。支持性投資組合持有高流動性的美元資產，以應根據聯繫匯率安排，為貨幣基礎提供全額支持。投資性投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場，旨在維護資產的價值和長期購買力。兩個投資組合的長期目標債券與股票比例為72:28。在目標貨幣配置方面，81%的資產配置於美元和港幣，其餘19%配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金管局已逐步、謹慎地將部分投資基金的投資多元化，擴展至更多類別的資產，包括新興市場及內地債券和股權、私募股本以及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股權由投資組合持有，而私募股本及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。香港金管局於LTGP項下的投資資產淨值上限維持於投資基金累積盈餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP項下的投資總市值達1421億港元，其中私募股本佔913億港元，房地產佔508億港元，尚有未落實的投資承諾1224億港元。\n\n戰略投資組合，於二零零七年設立，旨在持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，這些股份是政府為策略目的，代表投資基金收購的。由於此投資組合的獨特性質，其並未納入評估投資基金表現的指標之中。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資流程\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置的決策為基礎，分別是策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資標竿中，代表了基於聯匯基金的投資目標，所能達到的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會以戰術方式進行配置，試圖在標竿之上取得超額回報。這通常意味著實際配置與標竿或策略性配置有所不同。實際配置與標竿配置之間的差異，被稱為「戰術性偏差」。雖然標竿以及戰術性偏差的上限由財政司長諮詢聯匯基金投資委員會（EFAC）後決定，但戰術決策則由香港金管局在授權下作出。在允許的戰術性偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可以採取 позиции，以利用短期的市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部職員直接管理約七成六的投資基金，當中包括整個支持投資組合及部分投資投資組合。此部分投資投資組合包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及一系列實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 外聘管理人員的使用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金管局還聘用位於多個國際金融中心的外部基金經理，負責管理聯邦元基金約24%的資產，包括所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產。聘用外部經理的目的是利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，捕捉多元化的投資風格，並將市場資訊和知識傳授予內部專業人員。\n\n聘用外部管理人所產生的支出，包括基金管理費、保管機構費用、交易成本，以及預扣稅款及其他稅費。此項支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n近年來金融市場波動劇烈，突顯了風險管理的重要性。內部和外部管理的投資組合均已建立嚴格的控制措施和投資指南，並密切監控指南和法規的遵守情況。風險控制工具被應用於評估市場在正常及不利市場狀況下的風險。香港金管局亦會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以充分發揮內部和外部經理的投資技巧。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2015年金融市場\n\n二零一五年，全球金融市場波動劇烈。特別是股票市場，經歷了異常的震盪。年初至今，主要股票市場屢創新高。然而，第三季度的市場情緒急劇惡化，主要原因是中國大陸經濟增長方面的擔憂，導致主要股票市場扭轉了年初至今的漲幅，並錄得顯著的季度損失。隨後，隨著市場情緒的改善，全球股票市場有所回升，但年末再次惡化。由於與中國大陸經濟的密切聯繫，香港股票在二零一五年表現遜於其他主要股票市場。\n\n在主權債券市場方面，儘管市場預期美國將啟動利率正常化並開啟美國利率上升週期，2015年美國長期國庫券殖利率仍溫和上升。這是因為樂觀情緒受到對全球經濟增長擔憂、持續的全球通縮壓力以及加劇的地緣政治緊張局勢所抑制。另一方面，歐洲央行積極的貨幣寬鬆政策推動下，短期歐洲政府債券殖利率下降，甚至部分債券跌入負利率區間。\n\n在2015年，外匯市場上，美元持續走強，美國美元指數上漲近10%，原因是市場預期美國將開始啟動政策利率正常化。歐元在第一季顯著走弱，創下自1999年以來歐元歷史上單季最大跌幅，原因是歐洲央行在1月份宣布了量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在2015年對美元的匯率基本持平。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現，請參閱表一。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n# 投資基金表現\n\n在異常波動的金融市場和艱難的投資環境下，投資基金於2015年錄得一項投資虧損，金額為158億港元，其中包括海外股本錄得收益71億港元，香港股本錄得虧損50億港元，債券錄得收益159億港元，以及非港元資產因匯率波動錄得負449億港元的影響，以及基金投資控股附屬機構持有的其他投資錄得收益111億港元。 去年美元匯率急劇上升，將投資基金的非美元投資換算成港元時，出現匯率波動影響是不可避免的。 另外，策略投資組合錄得一項估值收益22億港元。\n\n香港金管局結餘基金截至2015年底，總資產值達3,4229億港元。 2015年結餘基金（不包括策略投資組合）的投資回報為-0.6%。 儘管如此，與表現不佳的主要市場指數及投資基金業界相比，結餘基金的虧損仍可謂溫和。 預見投資環境將持續惡化，香港金管局過去幾年已採取一系列防禦措施，包括縮短債券投資組合的期限、增加現金儲備，以及顯著減少非美元資產。 我們亦加快了投資多元化的步伐，尤其透過長期投資計劃（LTGP）進行投資。 這些措施已增強了結餘基金的韌性，並有助減輕部分潛在損失。\n\n基金自一九九四年至二零一五年之年度回報，詳見圖表一。表二顯示基金於二零一五年之投資回報，以及於多個不同時間段的平均投資回報。過去三年平均回報為百分之一點二，過去五年平均回報為百分之一點八，過去十年平均回報為百分之三點三，自一九九四年以來平均回報為百分之五點零。表三顯示基金資產於二零一五年十二月三十一日的貨幣配置。\n\n圖表一 投資基金回報（1994 – 2015年）\n1 投資回報計算不包括戰略投資組合的持倉。\n2 綜合消費者價格指數乃以2009\/2010年為基準序列計算。\n"}

The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","zh":"# 企業職能\n\n金管局透過媒體、公眾教育項目及其他多種渠道，與社會各界及市場保持有效的溝通，以促進對其政策及營運的理解。 於二零一五年，金管局透過支持員工專業發展、實施嚴格的財務紀律、加強資訊科技安全，以及重新調整高級管理層的職責，提升公司治理，以應對實施新計劃及系統，以及工作日益複雜所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 社群參與 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n\n香港金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度，並促進公眾對其政策及工作的理解。 於二零一五年，共舉行了五十九項公開傳媒活動，包括十四場新聞發佈會、十四場即席訪問及三十一項其他公開活動。 此外，安排了四十三場傳媒專訪，發佈了三百二十五份中英雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量傳媒查詢。\n\n此外，為加強公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的了解，分別組織了兩次媒體參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（香港銀行同業結算系統），展示香港世界級的鈔票印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時，為媒體就貨幣發行制度、人民幣業務及投資基金等重要議題，進行了深入的教育工作坊，以便更詳細地介紹相關內容。\n\n香港金管局總裁陳家強先生（中），及貨幣管理執行董事李嘉麒先生（右），於香港印鈔有限公司媒體參觀時，巡視紙幣的防偽特徵。\n\n香港金融管理局在香港清算有限公司舉行傳媒參觀活動期間，展示自動化支票分類系統。照片中央（由左至右）為香港金融管理局總裁陳德棣先生、金融基礎設施執行董事李奕明先生及香港清算有限公司行政總裁唐麗嫦女士。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公共查詢服務為市民從香港金管局獲取資訊提供了一個有效途徑，有助他們更深入地了解該機構的主要職能。 該服務於二零一五年處理了九千零七十八宗查詢。 其中約一半與銀行政策及法規、紙幣及硬幣，以及消費者銀行事務有關。 值得注意的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品及服務、防止洗錢及恐怖分子融資，以及硬幣收藏計劃。\n\n圖一顯示自2012年以來所收到的公共諮詢數量，圖二則詳列了2015年諮詢的類別。\n\n圖一 公共諮詢總數\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了香港金管局年度報告外， прошлом году香港金管局亦發布了兩期《半年貨幣及金融穩定局勢報告》、四期《季刊》及定期更新的《月度統計通報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊及分析。此外，香港金管局高級管理層更發表了十四篇《洞見》文章，涵蓋多項時弊及及時的政策議題。\n\n香港金管局二零一四年年報，於香港管理協會二零一五年最佳年報獎中，在「非牟利及慈善機構」組別中獲得銅獎。\n\n# 香港金管局網站\n\n香港金管局的企業網站（www.hkma.gov.hk），提供超過五萬頁的英文、繁體中文及簡體中文內容，是公眾獲取香港金管局最新資訊的主要途徑。網站亦載有《銀行條例》第20條規定的獲授權金融機構（AIs）人員登記冊及獲授權金融機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊。隨著《支付系統及預付卡牌發牌條例》的實施，網站將亦會載有該條例下的預付卡牌發牌機構登記冊。網站已提供專頁及醒目的快捷連結，以引起公眾對重要及時資訊的注意，例如提醒市民時刻警惕電話騙案，以及金幣換取計劃中金幣換取櫃位的地點等。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公共教育項目\n\n香港金管局位於國際金融中心二期55樓的資訊中心，是向社會大眾介紹金管局工作、推廣大眾對貨幣及銀行事務認識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，每週開放六天。展覽區介紹金管局的工作以及香港的貨幣及銀行發展，其中包括閱讀材料及展品，供公眾研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務。\n\n資訊中心會為遊客安排導覽導覽團。年內，中心接待了超過四萬八千三百位遊客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過六百三十個導覽團（見圖3）。自二零零三年十二月開幕以來，共有超過五十三萬四千多人次參觀了資訊中心。\n\n圖書館毗鄰展覽區，收藏超過二十三千冊書籍、期刊及其他出版物，供從事香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務以及中央銀行議題的深入研究。此外，圖書館亦根據《銀行條例》第二十條的要求，維持香港人工智能的電子登記冊。\n\n為持續推廣社區聯繫計劃，金管局繼續舉辦公眾教育講座。 2015年，共舉辦了三場講座，參與者有約2,300名中學學生及教師。 講座內容包括聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、智能使用信用卡及存款保障計劃。 自1998年計劃推出以來，共有超過54,700人參與。\n\n圖3 資訊中心各類團體參訪\n\n年青遊客在導覽員的帶領下，參觀資訊中心，了解香港貨幣和銀行業的發展歷程。\n\n中學學生和教師參與公共教育講座。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n金管局致力招聘、培養及保留一支高素質專業人員隊伍，以支持其政策目標並靈活應對不斷變化的工作 приоритет。 儘管金管局是政府不可或缺的一部分，但它能夠以與公務員不同的條款聘用員工，以吸引擁有適當經驗和專業知識的人才。 作為一個公營機構，金管局旨在維持精簡且靈活的架構，並重新部署人員資源，以推行新舉措和應付日益增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變動\n\n經《支付系統及預付卡牌發牌條例》生效後，香港金管局（金管局）於二零一五年十二月在金融管理部（MMD）下設立了零售支付監察科，以履行金管局根據條例賦予的新法定職責，負責預付卡牌及其他零售支付系統的牌照發出及日常監察工作。為加強各部門協調，並重新調整人員資源以應對新措施實施帶來的挑戰，以及工作量增加和工作複雜性提高，金管局於二零一五年已計劃在二零一六年年初實施各部門職責的調整。具體細節如下：\n\n金融基礎建設部（FID）已接管存款保障計劃的管理及結算職能，這些之前由執法及後續行動部門（ENFD）和貨幣部（MMD）負責。此外，該部亦從銀行部門接手部分與銀行相關的工作，例如消費者教育、董事發展以及針對銀行從業員的提升能力框架。\n\n外部部門接手了MMD的市場開發職能，而後者將繼續負責與財政市場協會及金融基準相關的工作；並且。\n\n執行部門接管了來自銀行監管部門的洗錢及金融犯罪風險管理處，並更名為執法及洗錢防制部門。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 人員配置\n\n香港金管局於2015年的設立編制為841個。此數字在2016年增加至875個（增加4%），以確保提供足夠資源應對：（i）新法案和倡議的實施；（ii）持續推展已被證明必要且需持續進行的試驗項目；以及（iii）現有工作的日益複雜和數量增長。新增職位將部署於以下職能：\n\n強化銀行和金融體系的穩定性，包括：\n\n加強對銀行業的監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試程序的現場審查、國際銀行標準的實施以及同行評審。\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險和網絡安全風險管理的監督。\n\n實施關於銀行及經批准的貨幣經紀人進行的店頭衍生工具（OTC derivatives）的監管框架，並遵守新生效的店頭衍生工具申報及記錄保存規定。\n\n加強反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融資的監管和執法力度。\n\n為推動《金融機構因應解決機制法案》的實施，目前正加緊進行規劃及準備工作，此法案旨在應用國際標準，以應對金融業「大到無法倒下」的問題。\n\n透過發展銀行董事賦權計劃，提升銀行業的專業能力，著重於獨立非執行董事，以進一步改善銀行治理，並與業界合作，推廣更完善的銀行從業員能力框架，尤其針對從事核心銀行業務的人員。\n\n加強新銀行、證券及保險產品的銀行行為政策及研究能力。\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；並\n\n加強對境內人民幣市場及離岸相（CNH）市場發展的監測與分析，以 поддержать香港離岸人民幣市場的平穩運作。\n\n加強對未來基金設立及聯交所投資產品進一步多元化相關擴展投資活動的投資、風險管理及法律支援，並在日益嚴峻的投資環境下，提升策略性資產配置及投資流程。\n\n實施新的法定制度，賦予香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及預付卡牌發牌條例》監管儲值設施及零售支付系統的權力。\n\n\n# 企業職能\n\n臨時資源會調配以應付其他工作需求。香港金管局會將職員以短期外派方式調往其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展局，以協助處理香港或金管局關注的活動或政策倡議。部分職員則會全職或兼職派往，為香港存款保障基金委員會及金融市場公會提供營運支援。\n\n# 薪酬政策及薪資審核機制\n\n財政司長（FS）會根據聯繫基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及監管委員會（GSC）的建議，決定香港金管局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條款，並參考現行的市場薪酬水平及慣例。薪酬包括總體現金福利及公積金計劃，實物福利則較少。現金福利包括每月固定薪金（或基本薪金）及浮動薪金，根據員工的表現，或會以一次性形式在每年發放。\n\n金管局員工薪酬每年由財政司長根據顧薪委員會通過專責事務委員會提出的建議進行審核，並參考顧薪委員會對金管局上一年表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問就金融界進行的薪酬調查結果以及其他任何相關因素。為維持員工薪酬的競爭力，有時或會就個別表現卓越的員工作出特別薪酬調整。\n\n香港金管局的任何已批准的固定薪酬調整或變動薪酬獎勵，均根據員工的表現分配至個人。香港金管局的投資專業人員受到變動薪酬制度的約束，旨在加強其投資表現與薪酬獎勵之間的聯繫。執行董事級別或以上員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，由金融管理局局長在顧諮詢薪酬委員會的建議下批准。相關員工在討論其薪酬時，並不在場。部門主管級別及以下員工的薪酬調整或獎勵，由香港金管局總營運長根據金融管理局授權並在批准的整體薪酬獎勵範圍內決定。\n"}

I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","zh":"# 匯儲基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n投資基金財務報表\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 審計委員會\n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 財政司長先生\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於頁碼134至222所載的財務報表，該等財務報表包括截至2015年12月31日聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及會計政策概要及其他說明性資料。\n\n# 金融監管機構對財務報表的責任\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表須按照行政長官根據《金融按揭條例》（第66章）第7條及香港財務匯報準則的指示，真實而公平地反映財務狀況，並就金管局認為為確保財務報表能免受因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤呈報而必要的內部控制負責。\n\n# 審計人員的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計，對這些財務報表發表意見。我按照《交易基金條例》第七條及審計署審計準則，由行政長官發出的指示進行了審計。這些準則要求我遵守道德規範，並規劃和執行審計，以對財務報表是否不存在重大錯誤斷言，取得合理的保證。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以取得關於財務報表金額及披露事項的審計憑證。所選擇的程序取決於審計人的判斷，包括評估財務報表重大錯報風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致。在進行這些風險評估時，審計人會考慮與實體編製真實、公允的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但並非為了對實體內部控制的有效性表示意見。審計也包括評估所使用的會計政策的恰當性以及貨幣機關所做的會計估計的合理性，以及評估財務報表的整體呈現方式。\n\n我認為我所取得的審計證據已足夠且恰當，足以作為我審計意見的依據。\n\n# 審計處處長報告（續）\n\n# 意見\n\n我認為，截至2015年12月31日止，財務狀況報告準確地反映了聯匯基金及本集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，並已按照香港財務報告準則妥善編製，符合根據《聯匯基金條例》第7節發出的首席行政長官指示。\n\n孫大衛\n審計主管\n\n二零一六年四月七日\n\n審計委員會\n入境大廈26樓\n九 Gloucester Road \n灣仔，香港\n\n# 目錄\n\n收益及支出表\n全面收益表\n資產負債表\n股東權益變動表\n現金流量表\n財務報表附註：\n\n主要活動\n重要會計政策\n會計政策變動\n收入及支出\n所得稅\n金融資產及金融負債類別\n現金及銀行活期存款\n與銀行及其他金融機構之存款\n指定按公允價值計量之金融資產\n可供出售之證券\n衍生金融工具\n按成本攤銷之債券\n貸款組合\n黃金\n其他資產\n於子公司之權益\n於聯營公司及合資企業之權益\n投資物業\n物業、廠房及設備\n債務憑證、政府發行之貨幣票據及流通貨幣\n銀行體系餘額\n銀行及其他金融機構之存款\n財政儲備之存款\n香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構之存款\n發行之外匯基金票據及票息憑證\n銀行貸款\n其他已發行之債務證券\n其他負債\n股本\n現金流量表內現金及現金等價物分析\n營運部門呈報資料\n質押資產\n承諾\n或有負債\n重大關聯方交易\n金融風險管理\n金融工具之公允價值衡量\n會計期間後非調整性事項\n截至2015年12月31日止年度尚未生效之修正、新標準及詮釋可能產生的影響\n財務報表批准\n\n# 外匯基金 – 收入及支出帳戶\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為本財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 投資基金 – 綜合收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為本財務報表的組成部分。\n\n# 匯生銀行 – 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n陳 Norman T.
