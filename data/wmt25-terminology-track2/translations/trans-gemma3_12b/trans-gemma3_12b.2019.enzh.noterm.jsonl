{"en":"The year of 2019 has been anything but uneventful.\n\nUS-China trade tensions remained a big wild card. Lingering uncertainties over trade talks between the world’s two largest economies rattled investor confidence and undermined international trade, manufacturing, investment and even consumption. Gone are the days when global economic expansion was a given. The global economy entered a synchronised slowdown during the year. In response to the slower growth, major central banks around the world have reversed course on their monetary policy normalisation.\n\nLocally, social incidents happening in the second half of the year dealt a further blow to the Hong Kong economy. The retail, tourism and catering sectors were among the hardest hit. For 2019 as a whole, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline in a decade, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.3% from a multi-year low of 2.8% at the beginning of the year. As 2020 dawned, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak posed yet another significant threat to both global and local economies.\n\nIn the face of such an uncertain and challenging environment, it is of paramount importance to maintain monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong, as I made clear when taking over as Chief Executive of the HKMA on 1 October 2019.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: the bedrock of an international financial centre\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) in place since 1983 has helped Hong Kong weather numerous challenges and shocks, demonstrating its important role as an anchor of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and status as an international financial centre. Notwithstanding the challenging external and domestic environment during the year, the LERS continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, once again proving its resilience in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s banking system also remained sound and robust. The facts speak for themselves: the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable and has strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone in recent months, while bank deposits continued to grow during the year. In a nutshell, no noticeable outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system was observed.\n\nThe stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems reflects not only the robustness of, but also strong confidence in, our systems. This did not happen overnight, but through years of efforts to build up buffers and strengthen surveillance, complemented by our swift response to rumours on social media platforms.\n\nOur preparations over the years for rainy days have built a solid foundation and strong buffers for Hong Kong’s monetary and banking systems. In addition to the vast foreign exchange reserves in our public coffers, our banking system has strong capital buffers, robust liquidity and very good asset quality, whether by international or historical standards. The eight rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures on property mortgages implemented since 2009 have also greatly enhanced banks’ resilience against a property market downturn.\n\nMarket surveillance and banking supervision make up the core part of our work in maintaining monetary and banking stability, and we have been strengthening our surveillance and supervisory framework from time to time. Apart from close monitoring of the credit and liquidity risks of banks, one of our new endeavours in the year was to make use of technology and granular data collected from banks to enhance our capability to monitor Hong Kong dollar funding and financial market activities in a more in-depth and timely manner. Stress tests and contingency planning have also been augmented in the light of the fast evolving economic and operating environment.\n\nIndeed, our robust regulatory regime has won strong endorsements internationally. During the year, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed that Hong Kong was well placed to address both cyclical and structural changes, given its significant buffers. Hong Kong’s effective legal and institutional framework for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing also obtained a positive assessment from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), making Hong Kong the first in the Asia-pacific region to achieve an overall compliant result in the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation.\n\nConfidence is the foundation for the proper functioning of markets and is crucial to the safeguarding of monetary and financial stability. To maintain market confidence, we have to be on high alert for, and respond swiftly to, any malicious rumours that may potentially cast doubt on Hong Kong’s monetary or banking systems. This is particularly important given the prevalent use of social media and instant messaging nowadays. While a variety of rumours were spread on social media platforms by fearmongers during the outbreak of social unrest, our quick and clear rebuttals to these rumours through social media, in addition to traditional media, proved useful and effective in clearing the air, quelling false rumours from spreading further, and upholding international and public confidence in our systems.\n\n# Banking system: an important pillar of economic activity\n\nThe banking sector, as an essential pillar of economic activity, plays a fundamental role in ensuring the smooth running of society and the economy. Despite the challenging operating environment since the latter half of the year, banks have been working hard alongside others and doing their utmost to maintain normal operation of their core functions and continue serving businesses and the public.\n\nIn addition to basic banking services like deposits and transfers, an important function of banks is in extending credit to borrowers in support of the real economy. We are well aware of, and concerned about, the cash-flow problem facing businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), under the difficult economic conditions. While safeguarding banking stability, we have launched a number of initiatives to ensure continued funding support to SMEs. In particular, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks was reduced on two occasions, in October 2019 and March 2020, by a total of 150 basis points to 1.0%; the level of regulatory reserve requirement on banks was also reduced by half in April 2020. These measures release a total of around HK$1 trillion in lending capacity, providing banks with more room for lending to enterprises including SMEs. We have also set up a platform – the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism – bringing together major banks in Hong Kong to explore and discuss specific measures to strengthen funding support for SMEs. I am pleased to see that many banks have responded proactively to our call and introduced relief measures such as principal moratorium for customers in need to ride out the storm.\n\nIn view of some SMEs’ feedback about difficulties in opening bank accounts, which is the very first step in accessing various banking services, we have made dedicated efforts to address this issue over the past few years. Our work is bearing fruit, as improvement in account opening for businesses is visible. As a further step to promote financial inclusion, the HKMA spearheaded the launch of tiered account services – Simple Bank Accounts (SBAs) with a streamlined customer due diligence process – to provide start-ups and SMEs with an alternative to traditional bank accounts. More than 2,800 SBAs have been opened so far.\n\n# International financial centre: from strength to strength\n\nWe have always been mindful of the need to strike a reasonable balance between regulation and development. Given the intense competition among financial centres, we have to work hard to strengthen Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre and thereby ensure its longer term stability. There are four key areas of work: technology, green finance, financial connectivity with the Mainland, and talent development.\n\n# Embracing technology in the digital era\n\nHong Kong has been moving fast in promoting financial technology (fintech) since the establishment of the HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office in 2016 and the introduction of the Smart Banking initiatives in 2017.\n\nOn the payment front, the vibrancy of the fintech ecosystem is evident in the strong momentum in the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS), the world’s first multi-currency, cross-banks and e-wallets, real-time retail payment platform. FPS registrations reached four million within a short span of 15 months, representing a high rate of penetration in a population of 7.5 million people. The Government has also adopted the FPS to provide the public with greater convenience in paying taxes, rates and water charges. More and more businesses are expected to use this fast, safe and convenient means of receiving and making payment to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIn the banking sector, significant progress was seen in applying fintech to their banking services and business operations. According to a study conducted by the HKMA, almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted, or are planning to adopt, artificial intelligence in their business applications. With the HKMA’s facilitation, banks have been applying big data and consumer behavioural analytics in their personal credit products. They have also launched over 800 Open Application programming Interfaces in the first two phases, covering a range of banking products and services. While encouraging banks to use fintech, we did not lose sight of the need for enhanced technology risk management and consumer protection in digital banking services. Timely supervisory guidance has been provided to banks in these areas.\n\nRegulatory technology (Regtech) is another area of great interest to banks, for its potential of enabling banks to conduct regulatory compliance and risk management, particularly in anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), more efficiently and cost-effectively. To facilitate greater industry adoption of Regtech and the building of a wider Regtech ecosystem, the HKMA organised the inaugural AML\/CFT Regtech Forum and issued its first Regtech newsletter in November to discuss possible use cases of Regtech. At the same time, the HKMA, as a banking supervisor, is exploring the use of supervisory technology (Suptech), including new data science and analytics, to enhance work effectiveness and efficiency. We have embarked on a series of studies and developed a road map for the implementation of Suptech in the next few years.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this is only the start of the fintech journey in the banking sector. The HKMA granted eight licences to virtual banks during the year. One of the virtual banks officially launched its services in March 2020, while some other virtual banks have commenced pilot trials through the HKMA’s Fintech Supervisory Sandbox. I look forward to the launch of the other virtual banks and the introduction of more innovative and diversified banking services to the people of Hong Kong that would help raise the global competitiveness of our banking sector.\n\nMore exciting developments are also expected at the international level. After successfully completing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial to connect our blockchain-based trade finance platform, eTradeConnect, with its European counterpart, we are conducting another PoC trial with the platform of the people’s Bank of China, paving the way for the digitalisation of cross-border trades. We have begun a joint research project with the Bank of Thailand to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency to cross-border payments. The Bank for International Settlements also put its first Innovation Hub Centre into operation in Hong Kong in November to foster fintech collaboration within the central banking community. All these developments present clear evidence of Hong Kong’s leading global position in fintech development.\n\n# Promoting green and sustainable finance for a better future\n\nClimate-related risks have drawn increasing global attention in recent years. To contribute to the global efforts in addressing this challenge, the HKMA unveiled three key measures in May to promote green finance development in Hong Kong in different capacities.\n\nAs a banking supervisor, the HKMA is undertaking a three-phased approach to promoting green and sustainable banking. A framework for assessing the “greenness” of banks has been developed for industry consultation under phase I, paving the way for the formulation of supervisory expectations and requirements for the banking industry under phase II and implementation under phase III.\n\nAs the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA actively advances responsible investment by integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment activities. Specifically, we have adopted the principle of giving priority to green and ESG investments if their long-term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. After venturing into the green bond market in 2015 as one of the early investors, we will continue to grow our green bond portfolio and invest in other ESG assets. We will also join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote best practices on ESG through our participation in international organisations in the ESG community.\n","zh":"二零一九年可謂是波瀾不驚的一年。\n\n美中貿易緊張關係持續成為一個巨大的不確定因素。全球兩大經濟體間貿易談判的懸而未決的不確定性，動搖了投資者信心，並削弱了國際貿易、製造業、投資，甚至消費。全球經濟擴張乃成定局的時代已經一去不復返。全球經濟在當年步入同步放緩。面對經濟增長放緩，全球主要央行已對其貨幣政策正常化路線進行調整。\n\n本地社會事件在下半年對香港經濟造成了進一步的打擊。零售、旅遊和餐飲業受到的影響尤為嚴重。 2019年全年，香港經濟萎縮1.2%，為十年來首次出現年度負增長，而失業率從年初的創多年來低點2.8%上升至3.3%。 隨著2020年的到來，新型冠狀病毒（COVID-19）疫情又對全球及本地經濟構成了另一項重大威脅。\n\n面對如此不確定且充滿挑戰的環境，維護香港的貨幣及金融穩定至關重要，正如我於2019年10月1日接任香港金管局總裁時已明確表明的。\n\n# 貨幣及金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自一九八三年實行的聯繫匯率制度，已助香港度過無數挑戰和衝擊，彰顯其作為香港經濟繁榮和國際金融中心穩定的重要作用。儘管年內外部和本地環境充滿挑戰，聯繫匯率制度依然運作暢順有序，再次證明了其在不確定時期的韌性。香港的銀行體系同樣保持穩健和強大。事實勝於雄辯：港元匯率維持穩定，並在近幾個月走強至聯繫匯率制度的強方波動區，而銀行存款在年內持續增長。總而言之，未見任何明顯的資金從港元或銀行體系外流。\n\n香港的貨幣及銀行體系穩定，不僅反映了其本身的堅實基礎，也彰顯了社會對此體系的高度信心。這並非一蹴可幾，而是經過多年努力，建立起充足的應對能力，加強監察，並配合對社交媒體上流言蜚語的迅速應對。\n\n多年來我們為應對雨天所做的準備，為香港的貨幣和銀行體系奠定了堅實的基礎和強大的緩衝。除了我們公共庫房中龐大的外匯儲備外，我們的銀行體系擁有充裕的資本儲備、穩健的流動性以及無論按照國際標準還是歷史水平來看，都非常優良的資產品質。自2009年以來實施的八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，也極大地增強了銀行應對物業市場下行的韌性。\n\n市場監察與銀行監管構成了我們維持貨幣及銀行穩定的核心工作，我們亦不時加強我們的監察及監管框架。除密切監察銀行信貸及流動性風險外，我們今年的新嘗試之一是利用科技及從銀行收集的細緻數據，以提升我們監察港元資金及金融市場活動的深度及時效性。 鑑於快速演變的經濟及營運環境，我們亦增強了壓力測試及應急計劃。\n\n事實上，我們穩健的監管制度已獲得國際社會的廣泛認可。在過去的一年內，國際貨幣基金組織重申香港具備應對周期性及結構性變動的優越條件， وذلك 歸功於其充裕的儲備。香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖主義融資方面的有效法律及制度框架，亦獲得金融行動特別工作組（FATF）的正面評價，使香港成為亞太地區首個在FATF互評中取得整體合規結果的地區。\n\n信心是市場正常運作的基石，對維護貨幣及金融穩定至關重要。為維持市場信心，我們必須時刻警惕，並迅速應對可能對香港的貨幣或銀行體系產生質疑的任何惡意謠言。 尤其在現今社交媒體和即時通訊工具廣泛使用的情況下，這一點更為重要。 在社會動盪爆發期間，恐慌者曾在社交媒體平台上散播了各種謠言，但我們透過社交媒體及傳統媒體迅速且明確地對這些謠言作出澄清，證明了其有效性，有助於消除疑慮，阻止虛假謠言進一步傳播，並維護國際社會和公眾對我等體系的信心。\n\n# 銀行系統：經濟活動的重要支柱\n\n金融業作為經濟活動的重要支柱，在確保社會及經濟的順暢運作中扮演著根本性的角色。儘管自下半年以來營運環境充滿挑戰，各家銀行與其他各界攜手努力，竭盡所能維持其核心業務的正常運作，並持續為企業和公眾提供服務。\n\n除了存款和轉賬等基本銀行服務外，銀行的一個重要功能是向借款人提供信貸，以支持實體經濟。我們深知並關注在艱難的經濟環境下，企業，尤其是中小企業面臨的現金流問題。在維護銀行體系穩定的同時，我們已推出一系列舉措，以確保持續為中小企業提供融資支持。特別是，銀行逆周期資本充足率緩衝比率已於2019年10月和2020年3月兩度下調，總計降低了150個基點至1.0%；銀行存款準備金率的水平亦於2020年4月減半。 這些措施共釋放約1萬億港元的貸款能力，為銀行向企業，包括中小企業提供貸款提供了更大的空間。我們還設立了一個平台——銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，匯集香港主要銀行，探討和討論加強為中小企業提供融資支持的具體措施。我很高興看到許多銀行積極響應我們的呼籲，並推出了如為有需要的客戶提供本金延遲還款等紓緩措施，以渡過難關。\n\n鑒於部分中小企業反映在開設銀行帳戶方面遇到困難，而開設銀行帳戶是獲取各項銀行服務的第一步，我們過去幾年已投入專注的努力來解決這個問題。 我們的努力正在產生成效，商戶開設銀行帳戶的情況可見改善。 作為進一步推動金融普惠性的舉措，香港金融管理局主導推出分層銀行服務——簡化客戶審查程序的簡易銀行帳戶（SBA），為初創企業和中小企業提供傳統銀行帳戶的替代方案。 截至目前，已開設超過2,800個簡易銀行帳戶。\n\n# 國際金融中心：蒸蒸日上\n\n我們一直都深知在監管與發展之間取得合理的平衡至關重要。 鑒於金融中心之間的激烈競爭，我們必須努力提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，從而確保其長遠的穩定。 我們有四個關鍵的工作領域：科技、綠色金融、與內地金融互聯互通，以及人才發展。\n\n# 擁抱科技於數位時代\n\n自二零一六年成立香港金融科技促進辦公室及二零一七年推行智慧銀行先導計劃以來，香港在推廣金融科技（Fintech）方面已步入快車道。\n\n在支付方面，金融科技生態系統的蓬勃發展可見於快速支付系統（FPS）的強勁推廣勢頭，這是一個全球首創的多幣種、跨銀行及電子錢包，提供即時零售支付的平台。短短15個月內，FPS的註冊用戶已達四百萬，在七百五萬人口中展現出極高的普及率。政府亦已採用FPS，為公眾提供更便捷的繳稅、市政費及水費方式。預計越來越多的商戶將會使用這個快捷、安全及方便的收款及付款途徑，以提升營運效率。\n\n在銀行業方面，應用金融科技於銀行服務及業務運營方面取得了顯著進展。根據香港金管局一項研究顯示，近乎九成的受訪零售銀行已採用或計劃採用人工智能於其業務應用中。在金管局的推動下，銀行已將大數據及消費者行為分析應用於個人信貸產品。同時，首兩階段已推出超過八百個開放應用程式介面，涵蓋多種銀行產品及服務。我們在鼓勵銀行使用金融科技的同時，亦未有忽視加強數字銀行服務中的科技風險管理及消費者保護的需要。金管局已針對這些範疇，適時向銀行提供監管指引。\n\n監管科技（Regtech）是銀行業另一大關注領域，因其有潛力協助銀行更有效率且具成本效益地進行監管合規及風險管理，尤其是在打擊洗錢和資助恐怖主義（AML\/CFT）方面。為促進業界更廣泛採用Regtech及構建更完善的Regtech生態系統，香港金融管理局於上月舉辦了首次AML\/CFT Regtech論壇，並發布了首份Regtech通訊，以探討Regtech的潛在應用範疇。與此同時，香港金融管理局作為銀行監管機構，正積極探索利用監管科技（Suptech），包括嶄新的數據科學及分析方法，以提升監管工作效率及效能。我們已展開一系列研究，並制定了未來幾年實施Suptech的路線圖。\n\n從更廣闊的視角來看，這僅是銀行業金融科技發展的起點。香港金融管理局在當年授出八張虛擬銀行牌照。其中一家虛擬銀行於二零二零年三月正式開展服務，而其他幾家虛擬銀行則已透過香港金融管理局的金融科技監管沙盒展開試驗。我期待其他虛擬銀行能夠順利推出，並為香港市民帶來更多創新和多元化的銀行服務，從而提升我哋銀行業的國際競爭力。\n\n國際層面亦預期將有更多令人振奮的發展。在成功完成一項概念驗證（PoC）試驗，將我們的基於區塊鏈的貿易融資平台「eTradeConnect」與歐洲的對應平台連接後，我們正進行另一次與中國人民銀行平台的PoC試驗，為跨境貿易的數字化鋪平了道路。我們已與泰國銀行啟動一項聯合研究項目，以研究中央銀行數字貨幣在跨境支付中的應用。國際結算銀行亦於上月在香港啟用了其首個創新中心，旨在促進中央銀行社群內的金融科技合作。所有這些發展都清楚地表明了香港在金融科技發展領域的全球領先地位。\n\n# 推動綠色永續金融，共創更美好的未來。\n\n近年來，與氣候相關的風險日益受到全球關注。為支持全球應對這一挑戰的努力，香港金管局於五月公布了三項關鍵措施，旨在以不同方式促進香港的綠色金融發展。\n\n作為銀行監管機構，香港金融管理局正採取三階段方案，推廣綠色及可持續性銀行業。第一階段已制定評估銀行「綠色」程度的框架，現正向業界諮詢，為第二階段制定對銀行業的監管期望及要求，以及第三階段的實施，奠定基礎。\n\n作為聯匯基金經理，金管局積極推動責任投資，將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入其投資活動。具體而言，我們已採納優先考慮綠色及ESG投資的原則，若其長期回報與其他投資在風險調整後可比，則予以優先考慮。自二〇一五年成為綠色債券市場的早期投資者後，我們將繼續擴充綠色債券投資組合，並投資於其他ESG資產。我們亦將與理念相近的投資者及監管機構攜手合作，透過參與ESG社群的國際組織，推廣ESG的最佳實踐。\n"}

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy contracted in 2019, reflecting global economic slowdown, lingering US-China trade conflicts and local social incidents. As economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second half of the year, the labour market faced increasing pressures. Inflation also increased due to a sharp rise in pork prices. Economic performance for 2020 is expected to remain challenging as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits the already weakening economy. Given the difficult economic environment, the Government and the HKMA have rolled out measures to support the economy, especially households and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nFollowing a 2.9% expansion in 2018, the Hong Kong economy contracted by 1.2% in 2019, marking the first annual contraction since 2009. In particular, the economy entered into a recession in the second half of the year, with the seasonally adjusted real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking consecutively in the second, third and fourth quarters (Table 1). The decline in economic activities reflected a notable reduction in domestic demand (Chart 1). As the local social incidents weighed significantly on consumption activities and sentiments in the latter part of the year, private consumption expenditure recorded the first annual decline since 2003. Overall investment spending also dropped amid dampened business sentiments. On the external front, slowing global economic growth and additional tariffs levied amid the US-China trade tensions led to a decline in Hong Kong’s exports of goods. Exports of services also saw the largest annual decline on record because the social incidents led to a severe deterioration in inbound tourism. With smaller domestic and re-export-induced demand, imports of goods and services also worsened. On a net basis, net trade contributed positively to GDP in 2019 (Chart 1) because total imports declined even faster than total exports.\n\nIn view of the strong economic headwinds, the Government introduced several rounds of measures between August and December 2019 to alleviate the financial burden of residents, safeguard jobs and support enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as those in the hard-hit sectors, such as retail, food services, transport and tourism. To allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle, the HKMA announced on 14 October a reduction in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.5% to 2.0%, thereby providing banks with more flexibility to release HK$200–300 billion in bank credit to enterprises including SMEs, and also established a Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism. A new relief measure for the 80% Guarantee product of the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) was introduced in September, allowing SME borrowers facing weakening cash flows to apply for principal moratorium to get immediate support. Further, a new 90% loan guarantee product under the SFGS was introduced in December to provide additional support to SMEs, businesses with relatively less operating experience, as well as professionals seeking to set up their own practices, to obtain financing.\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout the year. As the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in March, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollars from, and sold US dollars to, banks at the rate of HK$7.85\/US$1, leading to a decline in the Aggregate Balance in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates generally picked up. At the retail level, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in late October following the decreases in the target range for the US federal funds rate. As for monetary aggregates, total bank loans increased by 6.7% in 2019, up from 4.4% in 2018, and total deposits grew by 2.9% during the year.\n\n# Inflation\n\nThe underlying inflation rate, which nets out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, rose slightly to 3.0% in 2019, from 2.6% in 2018. The mild increase in inflation was mainly driven by the elevated pork prices due to the disrupted supply of fresh pork since May (Chart 2). Excluding basic food items, price pressures were held at moderate levels throughout the year. In particular, the housing component of consumer price inflation softened in tandem with an earlier consolidation of fresh-letting private residential rentals. More broadly, the mild growth in nominal wages and the slower increase in commercial rentals1 helped keep local business costs in check. Externally, import price inflation moderated, in line with lower inflation in some of Hong Kong’s major import sources amid slower global economic growth.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market remained broadly resilient in the first half of 2019 but faced mounting pressures in the second half (Chart 3). After staying at a multi-year low of 2.8% in the first two quarters, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.9% in the third quarter and 3.3% in the final quarter, with those for the consumption and tourism-related sectors recording even more visible rises amid the social incidents. Overall labour demand also shrank visibly in the latter part of the year as total employment and the number of privatesector vacancies fell. The reduction in labour demand was particularly prominent in the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, as well as import\/export trade and construction sectors. On the supply side, the labour force participation rate edged down, partly due to a cyclical response to the economic recession. As the labour market came under increasing pressures, growth in nominal wage and earnings showed signs of a slowdown towards the end of the year.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market experienced sharp fluctuations during 2019. After a market rally in the first four months, the Hang Seng Index plunged in May due in part to concerns about the re-escalation of the US-China trade tensions (Chart 4). While recouping some lost ground in June in response to major central banks’ signals of a more accommodative monetary stance, stock prices came under pressure again amid slowing global economic growth and local social incidents. Towards the end of the year, stock prices regained some upward momentum following the announcement of a “phase one” trade agreement between the US and Mainland China. The Hang Seng Index finished the year at 28,190, registering an overall gain of 9.1% for the year. By contrast, the average daily turnover declined by about 19% from a year earlier. The listings of a major Mainland tech company and a leading beer manufacturer helped expand equity funds raised through initial public offerings (IpOs) to HK$314.2 billion in 2019. Hong Kong ranked first globally in terms of funds raised through IpOs for a second straight year in 2019.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market staged a strong rebound in the first five months of 2019 but generally softened in the remainder of the year. Market sentiment improved in early 2019 partly because concerns over US-China trade tensions temporarily eased, but the sentiment was dampened afterwards by the re-escalated US-China trade tensions, prolonged social incidents and weakened domestic economic conditions. Overall housing prices moderated by 5% from the peak in May through December, though still recording an annual growth of 5% due to a 10% rebound in the first five months (Chart 4). Transaction volume in 2019 increased by 4% to 59,797 units from a year earlier, reflecting the strong trading activities in the early part of the year. Housing affordability remained stretched, with the price-toincome ratio and the income-gearing ratio staying high at 17.9 and 80.9 respectively, far above their long-term averages.2 To assist home buyers with immediate housing needs, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) in mid-October raised the cap on the value of completed residential properties eligible for a mortgage loan under the Mortgage Insurance programme.3 On the other hand, the non-residential property market faced stronger downward pressures in 2019. In particular, both prices and rentals for retail premises registered the largest declines since the global financial crisis in 2008, reflecting the worsening business conditions during the year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic performance for 2020 is expected to be very challenging, with significant near-term downside risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Some sectors, such as retail, accommodation, food services, tourism and transport, which have yet to recover from the disruptions caused by the social incidents, will be doubly hit. However, the countercyclical fiscal measures announced in the 2020\/21 Budget, which include a one-off cash handout and a new concessionary low-interest loan under the SFGS with 100% Government guarantee, are expected to provide some support to the economy, especially households and SMEs. On 16 March 2020, the HKMA further reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer ratio of banks from 2.0% to 1.0%, which will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy, in particular those sectors and individuals that are expected to experience additional short-term stress due to the impact arising from the coronavirus outbreak. Analysed by GDP component, private consumption and investment are likely to remain weak because of the fragile consumer and business confidence. While government consumption will contribute to economic growth, public investment expenditure is anticipated to be relatively sluggish following the completion of some major infrastructure projects. On the external front, the “phase one” trade deal between the US and Mainland China is assessed to be slightly positive for the local economy in the short term. However, Hong Kong’s external trade performance will continue to be weighed down by weak global economic growth and trade flows. In particular, the coronavirus outbreak may lead to regional supply chain disruptions and slower cross-border economic activities, in tourism for example, thereby restraining Hong Kong’s exports. The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2020 in the range of -1.5% to 0.5%, while growth forecasts by international organisations and privatesector analysts averaged -3.3%.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2020 because of the sub-par economic conditions, the consolidation of private residential rentals and mild imported inflation. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate for 2020 of 1.8%, and the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 1.7% and 2.5% respectively. In the labour market, the unemployment rate is likely to rise further in the near term, given the weakened economic prospects and the coronavirus outbreak. privatesector analysts expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 4.0% in 2020.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe subdued economic outlook for 2020 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including those stemming from the slowing global economy, US-China trade relations, Mainland’s economic performance, local social incidents and the persistence of the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, a prolonged coronavirus outbreak could trigger a more visible global economic slowdown and a repricing of assets, with the resulting unfavourable macroeconomic environment and tighter financial conditions posing further downward pressures on domestic real activities. However, the more concerted effort by major central banks to ease their monetary policies may provide a cushion against the negative economic impact inflicted by the outbreak.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector was resilient in 2019 despite the challenging environment with the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and local social incidents. Bank balance sheet trends were stable, as both loans and deposits grew moderately. The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained solid and asset quality held up well. The banking sector remained profitable with stable average return on asset.\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n二零一九年，香港經濟收縮，反映了全球經濟放緩、持續的中美貿易摩擦以及本地社會事件。 由於經濟狀況在下半年迅速惡化，勞工市場面臨日益增加的壓力。 豬肉價格急劇上漲也導致通脹上升。 預計二零二零年的經濟表現仍將面臨挑戰，因為新型冠狀病毒疫情對已經疲弱的經濟造成衝擊。 鑒於艱難的經濟環境，政府和香港金管局已推出措施以支持經濟，特別是針對家庭和中小企業。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n繼2018年錄得2.9%的增長後，香港經濟在2019年收縮1.2%，創下自2009年以來首次年度負增長。尤其是在下半年，經濟陷入衰退，經季節性調整後的實際本地生產總值（GDP）連續在第二、第三和第四季下降（見表1）。經濟活動的下滑反映了本地需求顯著減少（見圖1）。由於本地社會事件對消費活動和情緒造成重大影響，私人消費開支錄得自2003年以來首次年度下降。整體投資支出也因商譽低迷而下降。在外部方面，全球經濟增長放緩以及中美貿易緊張局勢下追加的關稅導致香港商品出口下降。服務出口也創下歷史最大年度下降幅度，原因是社會事件導致入境旅遊業嚴重惡化。由於本地和轉口需求減少，商品和服務進口也惡化。從淨值來看，2019年淨貿易對GDP的貢獻為正（見圖1），因為總進口下降的速度比總出口更快。\n\n鑒於強勁的經濟逆風，政府於2019年8月至12月間推出數輪措施，以減輕居民的財政負擔，保障就業，並支持企業，特別是受重創行業中的中小企業，例如零售、餐飲、交通運輸和旅遊業。為使銀行更能支持本地經濟，並有助減緩經濟週期，香港金管局於10月14日宣布將銀行反週期資本補充緩衝比率從2.5%下調至2.0%，從而為銀行提供更大的靈活性，釋放2000億至3000億港元的銀行信貸予包括中小企業在內的企業，並設立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制。於9月份推出了一項針對中小企業融資擔保計劃（SFGS）80%擔保產品的新紓緩措施，讓面臨現金流量削弱的中小企業借款人可申請本金延遲還款，以獲得即時支持。此外，於12月份推出了一項SFGS下90%貸款擔保產品，為中小企業、營運經驗相對較少的新興企業，以及有意開設個人執業的專業人士提供額外支持，以獲取融資。\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n二零一九年，香港的匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。全年，香港的匯率大致保持穩定。由於三月份觸發了弱方聯繫機制，金管局以每美元七點八五港元的匯率，向銀行買入港元並出售美元，導致累積結餘減少，符合聯繫匯率制度的設計。銀行同業利率在長端維持大致穩定，而短期利率則普遍上升。在零售層面，多家銀行於十月下旬，在美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍下調後，相繼降低其優越貸款利率十二點五個基點。就貨幣總量而言，銀行貸款總額在二零一九年上升了百分之六點七，較二零一八年的百分之四點四增長，而銀行存款總額則在當年增長了百分之二點九。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n撇除政府的一次性紓緩措施影響後，核心通脹率於2019年略升至3.0%，較2018年的2.6%為高。溫和的通脹上升主要受惠於自五月以來，由於活豬供應受阻，導致豬肉價格上升（見圖2）。撇除基本糧食項目外，全年價格壓力維持於適中水平。尤其，消費者物價指數中的房屋成份，隨著先前私人租屋市場的調整而有所回落。更廣泛地說，名義工資的溫和增長以及商業租金增速放緩有助於控制本地經營成本。外部方面，進口物價通脹溫和，與主要進口來源地通脹放緩以及全球經濟增長減慢相符。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n一九年上半年勞工市場大致保持穩健，但下半年面臨日益增大的壓力（見圖3）。失業率在第一季和第二季維持在多年來的新低2.8%後，第三季上升至2.9%，第四季更升至3.3%，其中與消費和旅遊相關行業的上升幅度尤為顯著，與社會事件有關。 總體勞工需求在年後段也明顯萎縮，總就業人數和私營部門空缺數都下降。 勞工需求的減少在零售、住宿及餐飲服務業，以及進出口貿易和建築業等行業中尤其突出。 在供應方面，勞動力參與率略有下降，部分原因是受到經濟衰退的週期性反應。 隨著勞工市場承受日益增大的壓力，名義工資和收入增長在年末開始出現放緩的跡象。\n\n# 股市\n\n本地股市在2019年經歷了劇烈的波動。年初至四月市場上漲後，恒生指數在五月大幅下跌，部分原因是擔憂美中貿易緊張關係再次升級（見圖4）。儘管六月份在主要央行釋出更寬鬆貨幣政策信號的刺激下有所回升，但由於全球經濟增長放緩以及本地社會事件，股價再次承壓。年末，隨著美中宣布“第一階段”貿易協議，股價重新獲得了上漲動力。恒生指數全年收於28,190點，全年上漲9.1%。相比之下，平均每日成交額較去年同期下降約19%。一家主要內地科技公司和一家領先啤酒製造商的上市，推動2019年首次公開發行（IPO）籌集到的股本資金擴大至3142億港元。香港連續第二年以籌集資金總額在全球排名第一。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n二零一九年首五個月，住宅物業市場強勢反彈，但其後全年普遍回落。年初市場氣氛有所改善，部分原因是中美貿易緊張局勢暫時緩和，但隨後因中美貿易緊張局勢再升級、持續的社會事件以及本地經濟狀況疲弱而受到抑制。整體房屋價格由五月份的峰值至十二月份回落了百分之五，但由於前五個月錄得百分之十的 rebound，全年仍錄得百分之五的增長（見圖4）。 二零一九年的成交量較去年增加百分之四，達到五萬九千七百九十七個單位，反映年初的活躍交易活動。房屋可負擔能力依然吃緊，價格收入比和收入負擔比分別維持在較長期平均水平高企的十七點九和八十點九。 為了協助有迫切住房需求的購房者，香港按揭證券公司（HKMC）於十月中旬調高了在按揭保險計劃下，合資格按揭貸款的已完成住宅物業價值上限。 另一方面，非住宅物業市場在二零一九年面臨更強的下行壓力。 尤其零售 premises 的價格和租金錄得了自二零零八年全球金融危機以來的最大跌幅，反映了當年惡化的經營環境。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n二零二零年香港的經濟表現預料將會面臨極大挑戰，與新型冠狀病毒爆發相關的短期風險相當顯著。零售、住宿、餐飲服務、旅遊業和交通運輸等行業，尚未完全從社會事件造成的混亂中恢復，將會受到雙重打擊。然而，財政預算案（二零二零至二零二一財年）所宣布的逆周期財政措施，包括一次性現金發放及一項由工資擔保計劃以一百分百政府擔保的新低息貸款，預期將為經濟提供一定支持，尤其對家庭和中小企業。香港金管局於二零二零年三月十六日進一步將銀行逆周期資本充足率從百分之二點零降至百分之一點零，將有助銀行更大力支持本地經濟，特別是預期因應新型冠狀病毒爆發而面臨額外短期壓力的行業及個人。從本地生產總值構成分析，由於消費者及企業信心脆弱，私人消費和投資預計將持續疲弱。雖然政府消費將有助於經濟增長，但公共投資開支預計在一些大型基礎設施項目完成後將會相對緩慢。在外部方面，美國與中國大陸之間的「第一階段」貿易協議被評估為對本地經濟在短期內略有正面影響。然而，香港的外部貿易表現將繼續受到全球經濟增長和貿易流動疲弱的影響。特別是，新型冠狀病毒爆發可能導致區內供應鏈中斷及跨境經濟活動放緩，例如旅遊業，從而抑制香港的出口。政府預測二零二零年的實際本地生產總值增長率為負百分之一點五至百分之零點五，而國際機構和私營機構分析師的增長預測平均為負百分之三點三。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n預計由於經濟狀況不佳、私人住宅租賃市場整合以及溫和的進口通脹，2020年的通脹壓力將會減緩。市場普遍預期2020年的整體通脹率為1.8%，而政府預測整體及核心通脹率分別為1.7%和2.5%。就勞工市場而言，鑒於經濟前景疲弱以及冠狀病毒疫情爆發，失業率在短期內預計會進一步上升。 私營機構分析師預測，2020年的失業率將上升至約4.0%。\n\n# 不確定因素與風險\n\n二零二零年的經濟前景黯淡，並面臨多項不確定因素及風險，包括源自全球經濟放緩、美中貿易關係、中國大陸的經濟表現、本地社會事件以及新冠病毒疫情持續擴散等因素。特別是，疫情持續擴散可能引發更明顯的全球經濟放緩以及資產重估，其後果是惡化的宏觀經濟環境和收緊的金融條件，進一步對本地的實際經濟活動造成下行壓力。然而，主要中央銀行更協調地放寬貨幣政策，或許能為疫情帶來的負面經濟影響提供緩衝。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n儘管全球經濟放緩、中美貿易緊張以及本地社會事件等挑戰重重，香港銀行業在2019年仍表現出強大的韌性。銀行資產負債表的發展趨勢保持穩定，貸款和存款均溫和增長。銀行業的資本和流動性狀況依然穩健，資產質素亦維持良好水平。銀行業盈利能力保持不變，平均資產回報率亦穩定。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money markets functioned in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained stable throughout the year and strengthened to the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its resilience to shocks time after time.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to buy Hong Kong dollars from banks upon request. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDespite uncertainties in the external environment and a slowdown in the domestic economy, the Hong Kong dollar remained stable and traded in a smooth and orderly manner in 2019. In the beginning of the year, the widening negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads attracted carry trade activities of selling Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, pushing the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate towards the weak-side CU of 7.85 (Chart 1). As the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued, the weak-side CU was eventually triggered eight times in March. Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar continued to stay near the weak-side CU rate of 7.85. Since late May, the strong Hong Kong dollar demand arising from sizeable initial public offering (IPO) activities, corporates’ demand for dividend payment and the half-year closing had led the Hong Kong dollar to strengthen. While the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower after the half-year mark, it regained momentum from late October and stayed in the strong side of the Convertibility Zone towards the end of the year. This reflected partly equity-related demand including IPOs, and partly the unwinding of short Hong Kong dollar positions due to tightened liquidity near the year end. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2019.\n\nDue to the triggering of the weak-side CU, the total of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding EFBNs declined from HK$1,136.2 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$1,133.0 billion at the end of 2019 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA purchased a total of HK$22.1 billion at the request of banks at the weak-side CU of 7.85 in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), leading to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) from HK$76.4 billion at the end of 2018 to HK$54.3 billion at the end of 2019. The outstanding EFBNs increased slightly from HK$1,059.8 billion to HK$1,078.7 billion during the year, reflecting the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice. The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. Total Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes at HK$1,133 billion at end-2019.\n\n# Money market\n\nDuring 2019, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely steady at the longer end, while short-term rates broadly picked up (Chart 3). Short-term rates also experienced more fluctuations driven by IpO-related funding demand and seasonal liquidity needs. The reduction in the Aggregate Balance since April 2018 may have led to a higher sensitivity of the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to changes in the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted downwards on 1 August, 19 September and 31 October by a total of 75 basis points, from 2.75% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% in early November, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved downward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 2.25–2.50% to 1.50–1.75% during the year. On 18–26 November and 19–31 December, the Base Rate was set higher than 2.00%, reflecting a marked upward trend of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) in the last two months of the year. As such, the Base Rate closed at 2.49% at the end of 2019. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, which sets the Base Rate at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs, whichever is the higher. On the retail front, several retail banks lowered their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in late October.\n\nThe discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened during the first two months, broadly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -708 pips in mid-February (Chart 4). Thereafter, along with the narrowing of the negative Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed gradually and turned to premiums towards the end of the year. Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets operated in an orderly manner. Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$38.3 billion in 2019 from HK$40.2 billion in 2018.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe LERS has contributed significantly to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability for more than three decades and has shown its resilience in multiple regional and global financial crises. Against the backdrop of social incidents happening during the year, a number of unfounded rumours casting doubt on the LERS and financial stability of Hong Kong circulated in the social media. The HKMA acted promptly and vigorously to rebut the rumours and reassure the public through the use of both traditional and social media, reiterating that the LERS would remain in place and Hong Kong would not impose foreign exchange or capital controls. In addition, the HKMA issued a number of articles to help the public understand the LERS operation, the flow of funds and the interest rate outlook. These efforts were effective in maintaining public confidence in the LERS, as evidenced by the orderly functioning of the markets throughout the year. The Government is also firmly committed to the LERS. public confidence in the Government’s commitment and the use of the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value were further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. In its 2019 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its long-standing support for the LERS as an anchor of Hong Kong’s financial stability, and commented that the LERS remained the appropriate exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong underpinned by Hong Kong’s transparent rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. Hong Kong’s banking system is highly liquid and sound, with liquidity positions and capitalisation being well above the minimum international standards. To ensure the resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on corporate, propertyrelated and Mainland-related lending. With a smaller Aggregate Balance relative to previous years, banks have in general strengthened their liquidity management arrangements and have been more proactive in managing their day-to-day funding positions. Furthermore, the HKMA has maintained close dialogue with banks to ensure smooth recycling of liquidity in the market, especially ahead of and during the subscription periods of large IPOs. No settlement gridlocks were noted during the year, with the Discount Window continuing to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.9–112.1% during 2019, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 111.2% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with Hong Kong’s robust banking system, will provide powerful support to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2019, the CBC considered issues including an event study on the LERS operations, the relationship between the Aggregate Balance and interest rates in Hong Kong, an improved and more flexible approach to options markets’ views about the LERS, and the impact of future IPOs on HIBORs. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), formerly the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, pursues research studies on topics in monetary policy, banking and finance that are policy relevant. This is reflected in the wide array of topics explored by HKIMR researchers and overseas visitors and in its conferences and events. The HKIMR collaborates with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise policy-focused conferences. Its research visiting programmes support research projects on policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA, Hong Kong and the region.\n\nIn 2019, the HKIMR hosted 14 research scholars, published 17 working papers, and held 11 public seminars covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues. It also organised three international conferences:\n\n- The Tenth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Financial Reforms and Economic Transformation”, was held on 10–11 January in Hong Kong, organised jointly by the HKIMR, the Financial Research Institute of the people’s Bank of China and the Research Institute of Finance of the Development Research Centre of the State Council. The conference provided a world-class forum for economic experts from central banks, international institutions, academia and the financial industry to discuss issues related to the risks that Mainland’s financial sector faced in the light of changes introduced by financial reforms and Mainland’s economic development.\n","zh":"# 貨幣穩定性\n\n二零一九年，香港的匯率及貨幣市場運作暢順有序。全年，香港的匯率保持穩定，並在年末向聯繫匯率制度的強方一側靠穩。作為香港貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度一次又一次地展現了其抗衝擊能力。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的首要目標是維持貨幣穩定。此穩定定義為香港幣對美元的外部匯率在匯率市場上維持於港幣7.75至7.85元兌一美元的區間內。貨幣體系的結構特點是金管局制度，要求貨幣基礎至少以存放於外匯基金的美元儲備為100%支持，並且貨幣基礎的任何變動必須與美元儲備的相應變動完全對應。\n\n貨幣基礎（見表1）包括：\n\n三紙券發行銀行所發行的紙鈔，均有債務憑證全額擔保。\n\n政府發行的流通紙幣和硬幣的總額，是指銀行在香港金管局保留的清算賬戶餘額之總和。\n\n香港金管局代表政府發行的交換基金票據及票息憑證。\n\n香港法定金幣的匯率穩定，乃透過自動調整利率的機制，以及金管局堅定履行聯繫匯率承諾（CUs）而維持。當市場對香港法定金幣的需求大於供應，且市場匯率升至每美元七點七五港元的強方聯繫匯率承諾時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求出售香港法定金幣，換取美元。集體結餘將隨之擴大，以降低香港法定金幣的利率，從而營造貨幣環境，使香港法定金幣遠離強方限位，並維持於七點七五至七點八五的浮動匯率範圍內。相反，若香港法定金幣的供應大於需求，且市場匯率跌至每美元七點八五港元的弱方聯繫匯率承諾時，金管局隨時準備應銀行要求買入香港法定金幣。集體結餘將隨之收縮，以提高香港法定金幣的利率，使香港法定金幣遠離弱方限位，並維持於浮動匯率範圍內。\n\n# 2019 回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n儘管外部環境充滿不確定性，而本地經濟亦放緩，香港在2019年仍然保持了穩定的匯率，並以平穩有序的方式進行交易。年初時，負面香港元\/美元利率差擴大，吸引了套利交易，即拋售香港元買入美元，導致香港元匯率向弱方保證區（CU）7.85元（圖1）靠攏。隨著香港元匯率持續走弱，弱方保證區最終在三月份被觸發八次。此後，香港元持續維持在弱方保證區7.85元的附近。自五月下旬起，龐大的首次公開發售（IPO）活動、企業股息支付需求以及中期結算等因素帶動了強勁的香港元需求，促使香港元升值。儘管年中後香港元匯率略為回落，但自十月下旬起，香港元重新獲得動力，並在年末維持在聯繫匯率制度的強方一側。這部分反映了與股票相關的需求，包括IPO，以及年末流動性收緊導致的短倉香港元頭寸的清算。總體而言，香港外匯市場在2019年全年運作正常。\n\n由於弱方聯繫匯率機制啟動，結餘總額（撇除貼現窗）與未償還結單票據之總額，由2018年底的1,136.2億港元，降至2019年底的1,133.0億港元（見圖2）。 該年，香港金管局應銀行要求，按照聯繫匯率制度（LERS）的設計，在弱方聯繫匯率水平7.85厘下，共購買了22.1億港元，導致結餘總額（撇除貼現窗）從2018年底的76.4億港元，收縮至2019年底的54.3億港元。未償還結單票據則略有增加，由1,059.8億港元增至1,078.7億港元，反映了為支付結單票據利息而發行的結單票據，符合既定慣例。 貨幣基礎總體上仍得到外匯儲備的充分支持。截至2019年底，結餘總額（撇除貼現窗）與未償還結單票據總額為1,133億港元。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在2019年，香港銀行同業利率的長端利率大致穩定，而短期利率則普遍上漲（見圖3）。短期利率亦因首次公開發售相關的資金需求及季節性流動性需要而出現更大的波動。自2018年4月起，集體結餘減少或可能導致香港銀行同業利率對本地市場香港元資金供求變動的敏感度增加。\n\n基準利率於八月一日、九月十九日及十月三十一日分別調整下調，總計降幅為七十五個基點，從一八年年底的百分之二點七五，降至十一月初的百分之二點零零，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年三次下調，總計降幅為七十五個基點，從百分之二點二五至百分之二點五零，降至百分之一點五零至百分之一點七五。至於十一月十八日至二十六日及十二月十九日至三十一日，基準利率被定為高於百分之二點零零的水平，反映出年內最後兩個月香港銀行同業拆息利率（HIBORs）的明顯上升趨勢。因此，基準利率在二零一九年年底收報百分之二點四九。基準利率的調整，符合二零零九年三月二十六日公佈的修訂公式，該公式將基準利率定為高於美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下限百分之五十個基點，或隔夜及一個月HIBORs的五日移動平均數的平均值中較高者。在零售方面，多家零售銀行在十月下旬美國聯邦基金利率目標區間下降後，將其優質貸款利率下調了百分之十二點五個基點。\n\n在首兩個月期間，香港 dollar 前期點差擴大，大致追蹤香港 dollar-美元利率差的走勢，截至二月中旬，12個月的香港 dollar 前期點差曾達約-708 點（見圖4）。其後，隨著負面香港 dollar-美元利率差收窄，香港 dollar 前期點差逐漸收窄，並在年末轉為溢價。總體而言，香港貨幣市場運作暢順。 2019 年的貼現窗借款減少至 383 億港元，較 2018 年的 402 億港元有所下降。\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n聯邦率掛鈎機制（LERS）已為香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出重大貢獻，並在多次區內及全球金融危機中展現出強大的韌性。在今年社會事件的背景下，社交媒體上流傳著一些毫無根據的謠言，質疑LERS及香港的金融穩定。香港金管局迅速而有力地反駁這些謠言，並透過傳統及社交媒體向公眾保證，LERS將會繼續維持，香港不會實施外匯或資本管制。此外，金管局亦發布了多篇文章，幫助公眾了解LERS的運作、資金流動及利率前景。這些努力有效維持了公眾對LERS的信心，正如今年市場的有序運作所顯示的一樣。政府對LERS同樣堅定不移。外匯及貨幣市場的穩定，進一步強化了公眾對政府承諾的信心，以及對香港元作為支付工具和儲值工具的信心。在2019年與香港的第四輪磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織重申了其長期以來對LERS的支持，認為LERS是香港金融穩定的基石，並評論LERS仍然是香港適當的匯率安排，這得益於香港的透明規則、充裕的財政及外匯儲備、穩健的金融監管及監察、靈活的經濟以及審慎的財政框架。\n\n健全的銀行體系對應對機制（LERS）的正常運作至關重要。香港的銀行體系流動性充裕且穩健，其流動性狀況及資本化水平均遠高於國際最低標準。為確保銀行業的韌性，香港金融管理局已密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並持續加強對企業、物業相關及內地相關貸款的監管力度。 由於累積結餘（Aggregate Balance）相較於往年較小，銀行普遍加強了流動性管理安排，並更積極地管理其日常資金籌措狀況。此外，香港金融管理局亦與銀行保持密切溝通，以確保市場流動性暢順回籠，尤其是在大型首次公開發售（IPO）的認購期前後。 過去一年未見任何結算凍結情況，貼現窗持續有效且高效運作。\n\n為提高聯繫銀行帳戶的透明度，自一九九八年十月起，已將一筆特定的投資基金資產撥作支持貨幣基礎。於二零一九年，支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）維持在109.9%至112.1%的範圍內，並未觸及上或下限觸發點。截至十二月三十一日，該比率報111.2%（見圖5）。在應變機制下，儘管已指定特定的投資基金資產作為支持投資組合，但所有投資基金資產均可支持港元匯率。若遇突發衝擊，投資基金龐大的財政資源，以及香港穩健的銀行體系，將為香港的貨幣及金融穩定提供強大的支持。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n聯繫基金諮詢委員會的貨幣發牌委員會（CBC）監察並審閱與香港貨幣及金融穩定相關的問題。於二零一九年，CBC 審議了包括有關風險參與計劃（LERS）運作的事件研究、集體結餘與香港利率之間的關係、對風險參與計劃的期權市場觀點的改進及更靈活的方法，以及未來首次公開發售（IPO）對香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）的影響等議題。有關CBC就這些議題的討論記錄以及提交給CBC的貨幣發牌委員會運作報告，均已刋載於香港金融管理局網站。\n\n# 研究\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR），前身為香港貨幣研究中心，致力於研究與貨幣政策、銀行及金融相關的議題，並注重政策實用性。這體現在香港金融研究中心的研究人員及海外訪學者的廣泛研究範疇，以及其舉辦的研討會和活動中。香港金融研究中心與主要中央銀行及政策機構合作，共同舉辦以政策為主題的研討會。其研究訪學計劃支持與香港金管局、香港及該地區重要的政策議題相關的研究項目。\n\n二零一九年，香港中文大學（深圳）– 院轄香港應用經濟研究所（HKIMR）接待了14位研究學者，發表了17篇工作論文，並舉辦了11場涵蓋廣泛經濟、貨幣及金融議題的公開研討會。此外，還組織了三次國際會議：\n\n第十屆國際中國經濟學術研討會，主題為「中國的金融改革與經濟轉型」，於一月十日至十一日在香港舉行，由香港經濟研究中心、中國人民銀行金融研究所在職研 институт и 國務院發展研究中心金融研究所合辦。本次研討會為來自中央銀行、國際機構、學術界和金融業的經濟專家提供了一個世界一流的論壇，討論因金融改革及中國大陸經濟發展所引發的變化，中國大陸金融部門面臨的風險相關議題。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2019, notwithstanding the headwinds brought by the weakening global and local economies. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the industry, the banking sector continued to operate normally amidst the social events. Efforts were taken to ensure that inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. During the year, the HKMA focused its supervision on the credit and liquidity risk management of authorized institutions. In view of escalating cyber threats and the industry’s growing dependency on technology, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. On conduct supervision, the HKMA streamlined its investor protection measures to enhance customer experience while according protection to customers. We also enhanced consumer protection in digital financial services and continued to promote a customer-centric corporate culture.\n\nOn anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), 2019 marked the conclusion of the Financial Action Task Force’s Fourth Round Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong’s AML\/CFT regime, which was assessed as compliant and effective overall, and earned positive recognition particularly for the banking sector’s good understanding of risks and the HKMA’s risk-based supervisory work in AML\/CFT. The HKMA has continued to participate in the public-private partnership for intelligence sharing on fraud and money laundering, and its active support for the adoption of AML\/CFT regulatory technology in the banking sector.\n\nOn banking development, the HKMA granted banking licences to eight virtual banks in 2019 and announced a three-phased approach to facilitate the development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong. The HKMA has been in close collaboration with the banking industry to optimise supervisory policies and processes and to carry out capacity-building initiatives that facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, substantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, liquidity standards and large exposure standards. The HKMA also continued its work to ensure there would be a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance the resolvability of authorized institutions.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs. To ensure that the resolution regime in Hong Kong is operational, it is important to lay down resolution legislation and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI. In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2019, 196 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment, corporate governance, risk management and fintech strategies. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 26 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs. Furthermore, 32 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, the AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducts regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. A total of 405 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were conducted during the year. Credit risk management remained a key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was in technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as the implementation of the Basel capital adequacy framework. At the same time, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses.\n\nTable 1 contains an overall summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2019.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nBank lending increased moderately in 2019. Total loans grew by 6.7%, compared with 4.4% in 2018. As shown in Table 2, loans for use in Hong Kong and loans for use outside Hong Kong registered growth of 7.7% and 5.8% respectively.\n\nMainland-related lending grew by 7.4% to HK$4,564 billion as at the end of 2019 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.51% at the end of 2018 to 0.48% at the end of 2019, well below the long-run historical average of 2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio increased slightly from 0.55% to 0.57%. Specifically in terms of Mainland-related lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio increased from 0.63% in 2018 to 0.79% in 2019, which was still low by historical standard. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio increased to 0.75% from 0.55% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA devoted increased supervisory efforts in ensuring that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards amid the uncertain economic environment. Solvency stress tests were enhanced to incorporate more comprehensive risk coverage and more severe stress assumptions. The results of the enhanced stress tests continued to indicate that banks generally had sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme shocks. Targeted and thematic examinations were conducted to evaluate the credit risk management practices of AIs in different areas, such as lending to corporates engaged in high-risk business, complex financing arrangements, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers. Recognising that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would more likely face greater challenges during economic downturns, the HKMA established a Banking Sector SME Lending Co-ordination Mechanism in October, with a view to encouraging banks to continue to support SMEs’ financing needs to the extent permitted by prudent risk management principles.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector to withstand a downturn in the property market has been strengthened significantly by the eight rounds of countercyclical macro-prudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 53% in December 2019 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages also decreased to 36% in December 2019 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risk\n\nThe HKMA adopts a three-phased approach to implement the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework under the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI). phase One assessment, involving all the major banks, was completed in 2018. The remaining AIs covered in the second and third phases have substantially completed the assessment as scheduled. The HKMA has also embarked on a comprehensive review of the CFI to fine-tune the initiative given the experience gained in the past years.\n\nIn October, the HKMA issued a revised Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Risk Management of E-banking”. The revision sought to provide the industry with greater flexibility to meet changing customer expectations on electronic banking services. The HKMA also published a set of high-level principles on the use of artificial intelligence in order to provide guidance for the industry.\n\nSince the social events started in June, the HKMA have maintained close dialogue with the industry to monitor the impact on banking operations and services. Banks were requested to replenish automated teller machines (ATMs) more frequently and repair vandalised facilities as soon as practicable. The HKMA also acted quickly to refute malicious rumours that sought to undermine the public’s confidence in the banking system. Thanks to concerted efforts by the banking industry, the affected bank branches and facilities quickly resumed normal services and the inconvenience caused to the public was kept to a minimum. In view of the rising operational risk posed by the social events, banks were asked to take additional precautionary measures to strengthen their operational resilience.\n\n# Supervision of liquidity and market risk management\n\nDuring the year, a round of thematic reviews was conducted to assess AIs’ capability to cope with liquidity shocks. The reviews focused on the robustness of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and contingency funding management. The HKMA also assessed AIs’ compliance with the regulatory requirements on the calculation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure the prudence and accuracy of the inputs used for the calculation.\n\nAs algorithmic trading gained popularity in the banking industry, the HKMA conducted a round of thematic reviews to evaluate AIs’ risk management practices in this area. Considering that the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) might cease to be published after end-2021, the HKMA reminded AIs to get prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates and conducted a survey to monitor their preparedness for the transition.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe HKMA carries out risk-based supervision of AIs’ AML\/CFT systems. During the year, 18 on-site examinations and 61 off-site reviews were conducted, including targeted thematic reviews on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology. The HKMA shared with the industry the observations and best practices drawn from a thematic review of AIs’ application of risk-based AML\/CFT controls for SMEs, in order to assist AIs to adopt appropriate account opening processes and delivery of services for SMEs.\n\n# Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation (ME) Report on Hong Kong\n\nA highlight of 2019 for the HKMA and Hong Kong’s overall AML\/CFT regime was the publication of the FATF ME Report on Hong Kong in September. The Report represents one of the best overall results to date in the FATF’s fourth-round ME of its member jurisdictions. Hong Kong scored six “Substantial” ratings out of 11 “Immediate Outcomes” in the assessment of the effectiveness of its AML\/CFT regime, and a high mark for the technical compliance aspect of the ME.\n\nThe Report favourably assessed the HKMA’s risk-based approach to AML\/CFT supervision, noting that the HKMA had a good understanding of ML\/TF risks in the banking sector and a reasonable understanding of risks in the stored value facility (SVF) sector. The Report also positively assessed the collective AML\/CFT efforts of the banking sector, such as the increased use of data analytics by larger AIs, the fact that the great majority of suspicious transaction reports were filed by AIs, and the sector’s proactive participation in the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT).\n\nThe Report recommended several areas for improvement, including the understanding of some higher-risk areas, such as foreign corruption and tax crimes, and developing sectors such as SVFs. Work has already started to address these recommendations; the HKMA published an updated ML\/TF Risk Assessment on the SVF sector in July and has commenced thematic on-site examinations on private banking and the governance of the use of new technology.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n香港的銀行業於2019年維持穩健及穩定，儘管全球及本地經濟下行帶來挑戰。 由於業界的共同努力，銀行業在社會事件期間持續正常運作。 我們盡力將對公眾造成的不便降至最低。 該年，金管局的監察重點集中於持牌金融機構的信貸及流動性風險管理。 鑒於網絡安全威脅不斷升級以及業界對科技日益依賴，金管局加強了對持牌金融機構科技風險管理的監察。 在行為監察方面，金管局簡化了投資者保護措施，以提升客戶體驗，並為客戶提供保障。 我們亦加強了對數字金融服務的消費者保護，並繼續推廣以客戶為中心的企業文化。\n\n在反洗錢和打擊恐怖主義融資（AML\/CFT）方面，2019年標誌著金融行動任務組織（FATF）完成對香港AML\/CFT體制第四輪互評，整體評估結果顯示其符合要求且有效，並特別肯定了銀行業對風險的良好理解以及金管局在AML\/CFT領域的風險為本的監管工作。金管局持續參與針對欺詐和洗錢的情報分享公私營合作夥伴關係，並積極支持銀行業採用AML\/CFT監管科技。\n\n在銀行發展方面，金管局於二零一九年批出八張虛擬銀行牌照，並宣布採取三階段方案，以促進香港綠色及可持續性銀行業的發展。金管局一向與銀行業界緊密合作，優化監管政策及程序，並推行增強能力建設的舉措，促進人才發展。\n\n在此期間，本地實施國際監管標準的工作取得了顯著進展，包括資本充足率標準、披露標準、流動性標準和大額風險集中度標準。香港金管局亦繼續致力確保為持牌金融機構建立可信的解決機制，包括落實有關損失吸收能力要求的規定，以提升持牌金融機構的可解決性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金管局的一般目標是促進銀行體系的穩定和安全。實現此目標取決於金融體系具有高度韌性，並能夠為香港經濟所需提供關鍵的金融服務。\n\n銀行透過其業務營運方式，以及在極端情況下因應不有序的倒閉，都可能影響系統的穩定性。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演關鍵角色，確保銀行能夠抵禦衝擊並在危機發生時恢復其狀況，從而最終有助於預防倒閉。 金融管理局負責對香港的銀行進行審慎監察。 其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和收存公司，這些機構統稱為持牌金融機構（AIs）。 金融管理局還負責指定和監察若干金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）。\n\n然而，金管局無法保證，亦無香港的審慎監管框架旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決機制權威，致力於確保在虛擬資產經營商（AI）出現不可行情況時，其失敗能夠有序處理。為達此目的，香港已建立針對金融機構的解決機制制度，根據該制度，金管局為虛擬資產經營商的解決機制權威。為確保香港的解決機制制度能夠有效運作，制定解決機制相關的法律及政策標準，進行解決機制規劃以消除虛擬資產經營商可解決性的障礙，並提升金管局處理陷入困境的虛擬資產經營商的能力至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採取國際協調一致的做法。\n\n# 2019 回顧\n\n# 監督活動概述\n\n於二零一九年，進行了 196 項離地盤審查，涵蓋了廣泛議題，包括「駱駝」評級評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技策略。為配合金管局持續加強風險管治的努力，與持牌財務機構的董事會或董事層級委員會舉行了 26 次會議。此外，金管局、持牌財務機構及其外部審計師之間還舉行了 32 次三方會議。\n\n除了離地檢查外，金管局亦定期進行現場審核，並配合對評估風險較高的範疇進行主題審查。年內共進行了 405 項現場審核及主題審查。信貸風險管理仍然是這些審核和審查的重點。另一個主要關注點是科技風險及營運風險管理。金管局同時增加了針對流動性風險、市場風險管理以及巴塞爾資本充足度框架落實的現場審核和主題審查數量。同時，專業團隊亦對保險公司於證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動進行現場審核和主題審查。\n\n表一總結了香港金管局於2019年的監察工作。\n\n# 信用風險監督\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n二零一九年銀行貸款溫和增長。貸款總額按年增長6.7%，較二零一八年的4.4%為高。如表2所示，香港本地貸款及非香港本地貸款分別錄得7.7%及5.8%的增長。\n\n截至2019年末，與中國內地相關的貸款增長了7.4%，達到4,564十億港元（見表3）。\n\n人工智能的資產品質維持健康。零售銀行不良貸款比率從2018年底的0.51% 降至2019年底的0.48%，遠低於自2000年以來2%的長期歷史平均水平。整體銀行業而言，不良貸款比率略微上升，從0.55% 增至0.57%。若單就與中國大陸相關的貸款而言，零售銀行不良貸款比率從2018年的0.63% 上升至2019年的0.79%，但仍處於歷史低位。整體銀行業的此比率則從一年前的0.55% 上升至0.75%。\n\n在一年內，香港金管局投放了更多監管資源，以確保金融機構持續採納審慎的信貸風險管理標準，應對不確定的經濟環境。已加強 solvency 壓力測試，納入更全面的風險覆蓋範圍及更嚴苛的壓力假設。加強後的壓力測試結果持續顯示，銀行普遍擁有充足的資本儲備，足以應對極端衝擊。金管局亦進行了有針對性和主題性的審查，評估金融機構在不同領域的信貸風險管理措施，例如向從事高風險業務的公司貸款、複雜的融資安排，以及向私人銀行和資產管理客戶提供有抵押品的貸款。鑒於中小企業（SMEs）在經濟下行期間更可能面臨更大的挑戰，香港金管局於十月設立了銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制，旨在鼓勵銀行在審慎風險管理原則允許的範圍內，持續支持中小企業的融資需求。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自二零零九年起，金管局實施八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，顯著提升了香港銀行業抵禦物業市場下行的能力。截至一九年十二月，新按揭貸款的平均貸款成數（LTV）比例已降至百分之五十三，較二零零九年九月首次引入逆周期措施前的百分之六十四有所下降。同期，新按揭貸款的平均還款壓力比率（DSR）亦由二零一零年八月首次應用上限時的百分之四十一，降至一九年十二月的百分之三十六（見圖一）。\n\n# 作業及科技風險的監督\n\n香港金管局將以三階段方式推行網絡韌性評估框架，此乃網絡安全強化計劃（CFI）的一部分。第一階段的評估，涵蓋所有主要銀行，已於2018年完成。第二及第三階段涵蓋的其餘持牌銀行已基本按計劃完成評估。香港金管局同時亦已展開對CFI的全面審閱，以根據過去數年的經驗對該計劃進行調整。\n\n十月份，香港金管局發布了《監察指引手册》(SPM) 修訂版，內容為「電子銀行風險管理」。此修訂旨在為業界提供更大的彈性，以滿足客戶對電子銀行服務的期望轉變。香港金管局同時亦發布了一套關於人工智能使用的原則，旨在為業界提供指引。\n\n自六月社會事件發生以來，香港金管局一直與業界保持密切溝通，監察事件對銀行營運及服務的影響。 金管局已要求銀行更頻繁地補充自動櫃員機（ATM）的現金，並盡快維修被破壞的設施。 金管局亦迅速採取行動，闢謠澄清旨在動搖公眾對銀行體系信心的惡意傳言。 由於銀行業界的共同努力，受影響的銀行分行及設施已迅速恢復正常服務，並將對公眾造成的不便降至最低。 鑒於社會事件所帶來的營運風險不斷上升，金管局已要求銀行採取額外預防措施，以加強其營運韌性。\n\n# 流動性風險及市場風險管理監督\n\n在年內，進行了一輪主題審查，以評估金融機構應對流動性衝擊的能力。 審查重點關注金融機構的流動性壓力測試計劃及應急資金管理的穩健性。 香港金管局同時評估了金融機構計算流動性保障比率（LCR）的合規情況，以確保計算所用數據的謹慎性和準確性。\n\n隨著算法交易在銀行業的普及，香港金管局進行了一輪主題審查，以評估金融機構在這方面的風險管理措施。鑒於倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）可能在2021年底後停止發布，金管局提醒金融機構做好過渡至替代參考利率的準備，並進行了一項調查，以監察其過渡準備情況。\n\n# 打擊洗錢和恐怖主義融資 (洗大錢及恐怖資金)\n\n金管局實施基於風險的虛擬資產（VA）反洗錢及反恐怖融資系統監察。年內，已進行18次現場審查及61次離地審核，包括針對私人銀行業務及新科技應用管治的專題審查。金管局亦將透過對虛擬資產應用基於風險的反洗錢及反恐怖融資控制措施於中小企業的專題審查所汲取的觀察及最佳實務，分享業界，以協助虛擬資產牌照持有人採納適當的中小企業開戶流程及服務提供方式。\n\n# 香港金融行動任務力（FATF）互評報告\n\n香港金管局及香港整體反洗錢及反恐怖融資制度於2019年的亮點，是金管局於九月發布的FATF對香港的互評報告。 該報告是FATF對其成員司法管轄區進行第四輪互評中，至今取得的最佳整體結果之一。 香港在對其反洗錢及反恐怖融資制度的有效性評估中，獲得了11個「即時成果」中的六個「顯著」評級，並且在互評的技術合規方面也獲得了高分。\n\n報告對香港金融管理局（金管局）以風險為本的洗錢及恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）監管方法給予肯定評價，指出金管局對銀行業的洗錢及恐怖融資風險有良好的理解，並且對儲值設施（SVF）業的風險也有合理的認識。報告亦對銀行業的整體AML\/CFT工作表現出正面評價，例如大型牌照持有人（AI）越來越多地使用數據分析，絕大多數的可疑交易報告均由AI提交，以及該行業積極參與欺詐及洗錢情報工作小組（FMLIT）。\n\n報告建議若干改進領域，包括加強對高風險領域的理解，例如海外腐敗及逃稅犯罪，以及發展如風險投资基金（SVF）等行業。已開始著手處理這些建議；香港金管局已於七月發布有關風險投资基金行業的更新版洗錢及恐怖融資風險評估報告，並已展開針對私人銀行業務及新科技使用的監管主題現場審查。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nHong Kong is a globally competitive international financial centre. The implementation of the Smart Banking initiatives has been in good progress to further develop Hong Kong as a fintech hub. Capitalising on opportunities arising from the opening up of the Mainland financial markets, much headway has been made to promote financial collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, especially in easing Hong Kong residents’ cross-border access to financial and banking services in the Area.\n\nAt the same time, much effort has been made to open up new opportunities to further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, including infrastructure investment and financing, green finance and private equity funds. The Hong Kong Academy of Finance was set up to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees, which is a clear recognition of Hong Kong’s expertise and commitment to international work.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nTo strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia, the HKMA puts great effort into implementing the seven Smart Banking initiatives that were announced in September 2017, with an aim to facilitate the development and use of fintech in the banking and payment industries. The key progress of these initiatives during the year included:\n\n- expanding the adoption of the Faster Payment System (FPS);\n- facilitating the implementation of phases I and II of the Open Application programming Interface (Open API) Framework in the banking sector;\n- further enhancing fintech research and talent\ndevelopment;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech; granting eight virtual bank licences;\n- facilitating the industry’s increasing use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 2.0 for launching fintech initiatives; and\n- further facilitating the adoption of regulatory technology (Regtech) through the Banking Made Easy initiative.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, plays a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives.\n\nHong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ allocation of renminbi assets, with its unparalleled access to the onshore markets through the Stock Connect and Bond Connect schemes. This was evident by the tripling of the number of registered investors and daily turnover under Bond Connect over the past year. Further enhancements have been introduced to both Bond Connect and Stock Connect, providing more convenience and flexibility for international investors to invest in onshore securities in the Mainland. The HKMA also worked closely with Mainland authorities to explore and implement a series of financial facilitation measures for Hong Kong residents to access financial and banking services across the border in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), including a prospective, two-way wealth management connect scheme. Hong Kong maintains a firm foothold as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Derivatives Market Turnover, Hong Kong continued to be the largest offshore renminbi FX centre in the world.\n\nContinuous efforts were put into opening up new opportunities to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform. To promote the development of the fund business in Hong Kong, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and industry to provide a more favourable tax and regulatory environment for fund formation. A number of large-scale events and targeted outreach activities were organised to promote Hong Kong as a hub for green finance, infrastructure investment and financing and corporate treasury centres (CTCs). In an effort to enhance Hong Kong’s soft power, the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) was set up in June to develop financial leadership and promote research collaboration.\n\nIn the central banking and regulatory community, the HKMA plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees. The HKMA chaired the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) until 31 August 2019. Currently, the HKMA is chairing the Supervision and Implementation Group (SIG) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The HKMA is also co-chairing the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group (NMEG) of the FSB with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre. The four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) achieved 100% system availability in 2019, beating the target of 99.95%. Through its accounts set up with the two Mainland central securities depositories, the CMU facilitates the settlement of transactions conducted under Bond Connect Northbound Trading and the holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nThe FPS, which serves as an extension of Hong Kong dollar RTGS system to enable the public to make instant retail fund transfers and payments across different banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) on a round-the-clock basis, ran smoothly in its first year of operation. Users’ adoption of the facility had increased steadily, as manifested in the four million registrations and tripling of transaction volumes by the end of 2019. The FPS brings new opportunities to the retail payment industry and promotes fintech innovation.\n\nTo ensure the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA has designated and is overseeing a total of six retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). The HKMA also issued two new SVF licences in May, bringing the total number of SVF licensees to 18. SVF licensees continued to launch new products and services actively during the year to diversify customer choices and enhance user experience.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2019\n\n# Hong Kong as a Fintech Hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking initiatives\n\nThe seven Smart Banking initiatives were announced by the HKMA in September 2017 with the aim of helping the banking sector achieve higher standards of operation and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology. During the year, considerable progress was made in implementing these initiatives and transforming the fintech ecosystem of Hong Kong.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe launch of the FPS in September 2018 was a major milestone in the financial infrastructure development of Hong Kong in the digital era. The FPS further promotes the adoption of e-payment in Hong Kong by providing efficient and convenient payment services to the general public and corporates. Since the launch of the FPS, the number of participating service providers had increased to 30 banks and 11 SVFs, with the addition of nine banks and one SVF, by the end of 2019.\n\nUsage of the FPS has also grown steadily. As of 31 December 2019, the FPS recorded four million registrations (Chart 1) and processed 44 million transactions involving an aggregate amount of HK$748.5 billion and RMB17 billion. In December 2019, average daily turnover reached 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million (Chart 2), as compared with 51,000 transactions during its first full month of operation in October 2018.\n\nFaster payment System recorded: \n- 4 million registrations as of 31 December 2019\n- 44 million transactions as of 31 December 2019\n- 168,000 transactions worth HK$2.4 billion and RMB38 million of average daily turnover in December 2019\n\nThe HKMA works with the industry to extend FPS usage from person-to-person payments to bill payments and other merchant payments. For example, enhancements were made to enable merchants to use a variety of proxy identifiers and accept partial or over-payments via a QR code. A technical specification was developed to facilitate the invocation of a mobile banking or SVF e-wallet mobile application (app) from a business mobile app for FPS payment. This would greatly improve customer experience in making merchant and business payments via the FPS using mobile devices.\n\nThe HKMA also works closely with relevant Government departments to assist them in using the FPS to accept bill payments from the public. From 1 November, bills issued by the Inland Revenue Department, the Rating and Valuation Department and the Water Supplies Department were printed with an FPS QR code so that the public could scan the QR code easily with supporting mobile banking or SVF e-wallet apps to make payment. The HKMA will continue working with various Government departments and public bodies to explore other potential use cases which can make it convenient for the public to make payment via the FPS.\n\nTo raise public awareness of the FPS, the HKMA has developed a new series of education and publicity materials, such as Announcements in the public Interest for broadcast on television and radio, as well as videos and electronic banners for digital platforms. The HKMA also participated in trade fairs to promote the FPS to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. Various FPS participating banks and SVFs launched promotion campaigns and offered incentives to encourage customers to register with the FPS and to use it for fund transfer and bill payment.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA engaged a number of industry organisations and institutions to provide briefings on the FPS so as to introduce its functionalities and the potential benefits it may bring to different businesses in collecting and making payment.\n\nThe Government has adopted FPS for bill payments on taxes, rates and Government rent and water charges.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nThe HKMA continued to facilitate the banking sector’s development and adoption of Open API in accordance with the four-phase approach of the Open API Framework. Under phase I, 20 retail banks opened up over 500 Open API endpoints in January, covering information of banking products and services. Under phase II, the banks opened up in October over 300 APIs to support applications for banking products and services.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOn trade finance, a proof-of-concept (PoC) study on linking up eTradeConnect and we.trade was completed in the first quarter of the year. In November, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and the Institute of Digital Currency of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to conduct a PoC study on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance platform to provide firms in both Hong Kong and Mainland China with more convenient trade finance services.\n\nOn Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand embarked on a joint research project named project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDC to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (pvp) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nHKMA Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Colin Pou (first from left), together with Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC, Mr Mu Changchun (first from right), witness the signing ceremony of an MoU to conduct a PoC trial on linking up eTradeConnect and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform.

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nGlobal financial markets performed better than expected in 2019 as the effect of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks outweighed concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions. Global equity markets rebounded following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, while major government bond yields declined and bond prices went up. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019, representing an investment return of 6.6%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary (FS) and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the FS for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes. This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at the aggregate of one-third of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund and the portion of the Future Fund and placements by subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund linked to the LTGP.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. This Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP, with the major exception of the Future Fund, which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP with reference to the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2019, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the FS in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA set up the Exchange Fund Investment Office (EFIO) in August 2018 to house its investment and related risk management functions. Staff members of the EFIO directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain their market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines are in place for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. As the investment environment has become more complex, risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased level of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, enabling the HKMA to assess how to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment (RI) by weaving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund.\n\nIn terms of public market investments, the HKMA implements both process-related and investment-related measures. One process-related measure taken by the HKMA is the adoption of the Principles of Responsible Ownership (PRO) issued by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2016, which help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. In managing the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has developed internal guidelines on ESG factors covering the process of selection, appointment and monitoring of external fund managers. The appointed external fund managers for the HKMA’s Hong Kong equities and Mainland active equities portfolios are required to adhere to the pRO in managing the investments on a “comply-or-explain” basis, and external fund managers appointed to manage the HKMA’s portfolios in developed market equities need to adhere to internationally recognised ESG standards. Apart from externally managed funds, ESG factors are also incorporated into the credit risk analysis of the HKMA’s internally managed bond investment.\n\nAs for ESG investments in the public market, the HKMA has invested in green bonds since 2015 as one of the early investors in this market, and participates in the Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme, which is run by the International Finance Corporation with a focus on sustainable investments across emerging markets. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to grow its green bond portfolio by either direct investment or investing in green bond funds. The HKMA also plans to construct ESGthemed mandates in equities investment by adopting an ESG equities index as a benchmark for passive portfolios and engaging active equities managers who apply ESG factors in their investment decisions.\n\nWith respect to private market investments, the HKMA examines the ESG policies and practices of general partners as part of its due diligence process. In particular, ESG risk evaluation is conducted as a mandatory part of due diligence in all LTGP investments. For the LTGP, the HKMA invests in projects with sustainable features; for instance, the HKMA has invested in renewables since 2013 in direct and co-investments in the energy sector, as well as green buildings and warehouses with green and sustainable features in its real estate portfolio. Going forward, the HKMA will continue to source projects with sustainable features and include green accreditation as a predominant factor in real estate investment.\n\nThe HKMA will monitor the development of ESG standards closely and assess how these standards can be further integrated into its investment process. The process is facilitated by its collaboration with like-minded investors and relevant international organisations. In particular, being a signatory of the UN-supported principles for Responsible Investment, which is the world’s leading proponent of RI, the HKMA expects to participate in the formulation of ESG best practices and to motivate other investors in adopting RI. Besides, the HKMA is also a member of FCLTGlobal, a not-for-profit organisation that works to encourage a longer-term focus in business and investment decision-making through workshops and research studies. In 2019, the HKMA also became a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nFor more details about the HKMA’s RI policy framework, see the Corporate Social Responsibility chapter.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2019\n\nDespite concerns about the global growth slowdown and US-China trade tensions, global financial markets performed well in 2019 on the back of accommodative monetary policies from major central banks. Following a significant correction in the fourth quarter of 2018, global equity markets rallied in 2019. In the bond markets, major government bond yields declined markedly while bond prices went up in the first three quarters of 2019 as a result of monetary easing. Although bond prices retreated in the fourth quarter amid a slight rebound in yields, the overall gains in the bond markets were still satisfactory in 2019.\n\nIn the currency markets, major currencies performed differently against the US dollar. After declining by 3.8% in the third quarter due to an escalation of US-China trade tensions, the renminbi recovered part of its earlier losses in the fourth quarter given easing trade tensions. Overall, the renminbi depreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar. While the pound fell by 3.2% in the third quarter due to the heightened risk of a no-deal Brexit, it had since rebounded significantly as more clarity on Brexit emerged in the fourth quarter, eventually gaining 4.0% against the US dollar.\n\nThe performances of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2019 are shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$262.2 billion in 2019. This comprised gains on bonds of HK$114.5 billion, gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.1 billion, gains on other equities of HK$100.7 billion, a negative currency translation effect of HK$13.0 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and gains of HK$37.9 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.5 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,206.7 billion at the year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$335.1 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$233.4 billion and real estate at HK$101.7 billion. Outstanding investment commitments reached HK$219.3 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2019, excluding the Strategic portfolio, was 6.6%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 9.7%, while the Bp gained 2.5%. The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 12.6% since its inception in 2009.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2019年全球金融市場表現超出預期，主要原因是各國央行的寬鬆貨幣政策效果抵消了對全球經濟增長放緩及中美貿易緊張局勢的擔憂。全球股票市場在2018年第四季大幅調整後反彈，而主要政府債券收益率下降，債券價格上漲。在如此有利的環境下，匯生基金於2019年錄得投資收益2622億港元，投資回報率為6.6%。\n\n# 基金交換\n\n據《金融管理局條例》規定，金融管理局的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港的貨幣匯率。 基金亦可被用作維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定及健全，以協助維護香港作為國際金融中心的地位。 金融管理局在財政司長的授權下，並於授權範圍內，對金融管理局的運用及投資管理負責。\n\n# 投資基金之管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會（聯匯諮詢委員會）已為聯匯基金訂定了以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 維護資本；\n(b) 確保貨幣基礎全盤以高流動性美元計價資產充抵，且隨時足額備抵；\n(c) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(d) 在遵守（a）至（c）的前提下，實現能幫助維持基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標完全顧及投資基金的法定職能，並已納入基金的投資組合架構及目標資產配置之中。\n\n總體而言，外匯基金擁有兩個主要投資組合：支持性投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支持性投資組合以高流動性的美元計價資產為主要持有物，旨在根據外匯基金制度的要求，為貨幣基礎提供全額支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場，以維護其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中期及長期的回報，香港金管局會以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將部分投資基金的投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別。當中包括新興市場及內地債券和股股，以及私募股本（包括基礎建設）和房地產。新興市場及內地債券和股股由投資組合管理計劃（IP）持有，而私募股本及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）的投資價值上限，定為投資基金累計盈餘的三分之一總額，以及與LTGP相關的未來基金及投資基金附屬機構的款項總和。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年成立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，這些股份是政府為策略目的，以聯邦基金的名義收購的。由於其獨特性，此投資組合不納入對基金投資表現的評估之中。\n\n# 聯匯基金的投資部署\n\n按時，投資基金會會接受財政儲備、政府基金和法定機構的存款。利率通常與投資組合表現掛鈎，但未來基金除外，其利率則參考投資組合及長期政府擔保計劃的組合比例而定。截至2019年底，未來基金的投資組合在投資組合和長期政府擔保計劃之間的比例約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置的決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資標竿中，代表著聯匯基金投資目標所決定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會以戰術方式配置，以期在標竿之上取得超額回報。這意味著實際配置往往與標竿（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與標竿配置之間的差異被稱為「戰術性偏差」。雖然標竿和追蹤誤差限額由金融管理局諮詢基金監察委員會後決定，戰術決策和戰術性偏差的可接受範圍則由香港金管局依據授權制定。在允許的戰術性偏差範圍內，投資組合經理可以建立 позиции，以利用短期的市場波動。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局於二零一八年八月設立投資基金事務局（EFIO），以整合其投資及相關風險管理職能。投資基金事務局的職員直接管理投資基金約七成一的投資，包括全部指定外匯基金（BP）及部分投資組合（IP）。此部分投資組合包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及一系列實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合，為基金提供風險覆蓋。\n\n# 外聘經理人使用情況\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金管局還聘用外部基金經理管理約佔投資基金約29%的資產，包括所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理旨在利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，借鑒多元且互補的投資風格，並獲取他們在投資方面的市場洞察力和專業技術。\n\n聘用外部管理人所產生的支出，包括基金管理費、保管機構費用、交易成本以及預扣稅款和其他稅費。此項支出主要由市場因素決定，可能逐年變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。內部及外部管理的投資組合均已制定嚴格的監控措施和投資指南，並密切監控指南和法規的遵守情況。 隨著投資環境的日益複雜，風險評估已得到加強，以支持投資組合多元化程度的提高。 風險控制工具被應用於評估常態及不利市場狀況下的市場風險。 此外，還會進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以識別績效來源，從而使香港金管局能夠評估如何最好地利用內部和外部經理人的投資專業技能。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n金管局支持負責任投資（RI），並將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入交易所基金公共市場及私人市場投資的投資過程中。\n\n就公共市場投資而言，香港金管局實施了與程序相關及與投資相關的措施。香港金管局採納的一項程序相關措施是，於2016年證券及期貨事務監察委員會發布的《負責任股東行為準則》（PRO），有助投資者確定如何最好地履行其在香港上市公司的投資相關股東責任。在管理投資基金時，香港金管局制定了涵蓋外部基金經理遴選、委聘及監察程序的內部ESG因素指引。香港金管局委聘的外部基金經理，負責管理其香港股票及內地積極股票投資組合，須按照「遵守或解釋」原則遵從PRO；而委聘管理香港金管局於已發展市場股票投資組合的外部基金經理，則須遵守國際公認的ESG標準。除了外部管理基金外，ESG因素也被納入香港金管局內部管理的債券投資的信貸風險分析中。\n\n至於公共市場的ESG投資，香港金管局自2015年起已成為綠色債券的早期投資者之一，並參與國際金融公司主辦的可持續發展新興市場重點投資的「受管理聯合貸款投資組合計劃」。展望未來，香港金管局將繼續透過直接投資或投資綠色債券基金等方式擴充其綠色債券投資組合。香港金管局亦計劃在股本投資中構建以ESG為主題的投資策略，將採用ESG股本指數作為被動投資組合的標竿，並聘用將ESG因素納入投資決策的活躍型股本經理。\n\n關於私募市場投資，香港金管局會在盡職調查過程中審核普通合夥人的 ESG 政策和實務。尤其，ESG 風險評估已成為所有長期股權投資（LTGP）盡職調查的強制性環節。對於 LTGP，香港金管局會投資於具備可持續特徵的項目；例如，自 2013 年以來，香港金管局已透過直接投資和聯合投資的方式，在能源領域投入可再生能源項目，並在其房地產投資組合中投資於具備綠色及可持續特徵的綠色建築和倉庫。展望未來，香港金管局將繼續尋找具備可持續特徵的項目，並將綠色認證納入房地產投資的主要考量因素。\n\n金管局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估如何將這些標準進一步融入其投資流程。 透過與理念相近的投資者及相關國際組織合作，有助於推動此流程。 尤其作為聯合國支持的責任投資原則的簽署方，而該原則是全球領先的責任投資倡導者，金管局期望參與ESG最佳實務的制定，並鼓勵其他投資者採用責任投資。 此外，金管局亦是FCLTGlobal的會員，該組織是一個非營利機構，致力於透過研討會和研究報告，鼓勵企業和投資者在決策中著重長期發展。 2019年，金管局亦成為氣候相關財務風險揭露工作小組的支持者。\n\n有關香港金管局的責任投資政策框架的更多詳情，請參閱企業社會責任章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2019年的金融市場\n\n儘管全球經濟增長放緩以及美中貿易緊張局勢令人擔憂，但由於主要央行採取寬鬆貨幣政策，全球金融市場在2019年表現良好。在2018年第四季經歷了顯著調整後，全球股市在2019年強勁反彈。在債券市場方面，主要政府債券收益率在2019年前三個季度顯著下降，而債券價格則上漲，這得益於貨幣寬鬆。儘管債券價格在第四季隨著收益率略有回升而回落，但2019年整體而言，債券市場的收益仍然令人滿意。\n\n在外匯市場上，主要貨幣兌美元的表現各異。人民幣在第三季因美中貿易緊張關係加劇而下跌3.8%，但在第四季貿易緊張關係緩和的情況下，部分收復了之前的損失。總體而言，人民幣對美元貶值了1.4%。鎊在第三季因脫歐無協議風險升溫而下跌3.2%，但隨着第四季脫歐局勢的逐步明朗，其表現已顯著反彈，最終對美元上漲了4.0%。\n\n表一顯示了2019年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。\n\n# 投資基金表現\n\n聯邦投資有限公司於2019年錄得投資收益2622億港元。其中包括債券收益1145億港元、香港股票收益221億港元、其他股票收益1007億港元，非港元資產的負匯兌換影響130億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資的收益379億港元。 另外，戰略投資組合錄得估值收益25億港元。\n\n基金總資產於年末達到四千二百零六點七億港元。根據長期投資計劃（LTGP）的投資總值為三千三百五點一億港元，其中私募股本為二千三百三十四億港元，物業則為一千零一點七億港元。未償投資承諾額達二千一百九點三億港元。\n\n聯邦投資於2019年的回報率，不包括策略投資組合，為6.6%。其中，知識產權投資組合（IP）的回報率為9.7%，而商業投資組合（Bp）則增長2.5%。自2009年成立以來，長期增長投資組合（LTGP）的年化內部報酬率為12.6%。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the traditional media, social media platforms, its website, the Information Centre and various other channels to facilitate public understanding about its policies and operations. Within the institution, conscientious efforts are made to improve the HKMA’s corporate governance by supporting the professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing information technology security, and promoting a culture of innovation to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY\n\n# Media relations and social media\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to enhance transparency and promote public understanding about its policies and work. During the year, 125 open press events were held, comprising 10 press conferences, 12 stand-up interviews and 103 other public functions. A further 25 media interviews were arranged. A total of 466 bilingual press releases were issued and a large number of media enquiries were handled every day.\n\nTo raise awareness of the HKMA’s key functions, the HKMA organised media briefings and educational workshops for local and overseas media as well as key opinion leaders in the community to facilitate understanding on a wide range of topics, such as the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), virtual banking, green finance, and Hong Kong as a competitive international financial centre.\n\nSince July 2018, the HKMA has launched various social media channels to strengthen public education and communication. Five social media channels are currently in operation: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, reaching out to a total of over 45,000 followers as at end-December 2019. Amid the social incidents in the second half of 2019, the HKMA made use of social media to rebut unfounded rumours regarding banking operations and financial stability, a move which proved to be highly effective in disseminating facts and preventing the rumours from spreading further.\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for the public to better understand the key functions and operations of the HKMA. A total of 9,742 enquiries were handled in 2019, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, consumer banking, and notes and coins. Some of the notable enquiries raised were about the Coin Collection programme, banking products and services, banking-related guidelines and circulars, the Faster Payment System (FPS), and monetary and economic statistics.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2016 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by enquiry nature in 2019.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Eddie Yue (left), and HKMA's then Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, meet with media after the announcement of the appointment of Mr Eddie Yue as the next Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2019 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA published 19 inSight articles, covering various topics related to its work. The inSight articles provide a useful channel for the HKMA to elucidate the rationale behind its major new initiatives or policies, and provide timely response to topical issues which are of interest to the public.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA official website (www.hkma.gov.hk) presents more than 40,000 pages of content in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, and is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of the securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. The HKMA official website underwent a major revamp and was relaunched in September with a new design layout, enriched content, an enhanced navigation structure, and more convenient search functions. The revamped website enables users to search information more easily and conveniently based on their own preferences. In particular, the revamped website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products or services. This is in line with the HKMA’s long-standing efforts to promote “smart and responsible” use of banking services.\n\nThe HKMA launches its revamped website.\n\nThe revamped HKMA website carries a new section on “Smart Consumers”.\n\nThe HKMA has been opening up financial data and important information published on its website via Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) by phases since 2018. By 2019, the HKMA has opened up 130 sets of Open ApIs on the HKMA’s website as originally planned. The HKMA embraces the development and application of Open API.\n\n# HKMA Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area describes the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA completed the last phase of revamp of its Information Centre — the Historical Timeline — during the year. The revamped Historical Timeline, featuring multimedia and digital display panels for visitors to review the major monetary and financial events in Hong Kong and globally in a more interactive manner, was re-opened to the public in October.\n\nThe first section of the Historical Timeline is made up of a multimedia display panel presenting major events from 1842 to 1993.\n\nThe second section of the Historical Timeline is a digital display panel presenting major events from 1993, when the HKMA was established, to the present.\n\nThe Information Centre organises guided tours for visitors. During the year, it received more than 48,000 visitors and hosted over 480 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 753,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for schools and other group visitors.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\n# Public and consumer education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised a public education seminar for over 400 secondary school students and teachers in 2019. Topics covered in the seminar included an introduction to the work of the HKMA, Hong Kong’s banknotes, the FPS, SVFs, fintech and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 60,000 teachers and students have participated in this programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts attend the 2019 public education seminar.\n\nThe focus of the HKMA’s consumer education initiatives during the year was on educating the public to protect their “personal digital keys”, a concept introduced to help the public visualise the significance of safeguarding information for accessing their online accounts. The central message was that in the digital world, account login details and personal information related to internet banking and other digital financial services were as important as the keys to their home, and should be well protected. Extensive promotion was arranged across different media, including the TV, radio, mobile applications, social media, and other digital and out-of-home platforms, to highlight smart tips on how to protect personal digital keys.\n\nThe Flagship Campaign on Personal Digital Keys is conducted via extensive cross-media promotion.\n\nSustained initiatives were also carried out to educate the public to be smart and responsible financial consumers. For example, members of the public were urged to stay vigilant of bogus phone calls purportedly from banks, and of investment scams promoted on social media. Issues to note when handling personal credit products, in particular personal loans taken out during the tax season, were also promoted.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA co-organised the “Hong Kong Liberal Studies Financial Literacy Championship” with various stakeholders for the fifth year. Infographics were newly used in the Championship this year to help students better understand sophisticated financial concepts. An online quiz was conducted, attracting 10,450 submissions and culminating in the grand final competition, which was held at the HKMA for the first time. \n\nThe Championship, attracting over 10,000 online submissions, ends with a live competition at the HKMA.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA kicked off the Second phase of its Cross-generation Outreach Educational programme, which was organised jointly with an education institution. The programme comprised bank simulation games, parents’ talks and train-the-trainer workshops, targeting kindergarten pupils, their parents and teachers, as well as young adults. Other initiatives on youth education included producing comic storybooks for primary school students and parents jointly with a professional association, as well as delivering talks to tertiary school students.\n\nThe HKMA continued to support the Investor and Financial Education Council in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with different stakeholders to maximise the impact of consumer education.\n\nThe Achievement Ceremony for the First Phase of the Crossgeneration Outreach Programme is held alongside the launch of the Second Phase.\n\nKindergarten pupils participate in the bank simulation game.\n\nComic storybooks are produced jointly with a professional association to disseminate smart tips on using banking and financial services to primary school students and their parents.\n\n# OUR PEOPLE\n\nWhile the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract people with the right experience and expertise. The HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities.\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2019 was 1,005. During the year, the HKMA conducted a cross-departmental re-engineering exercise to enhance the efficiency of various work processes and redeploy existing resources to support new initiatives. As a result of this rigorous exercise, the overall establishment of the HKMA in 2020 remains unchanged at 1,005.

{"en":"# Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable and environment-friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# MARKETPLACE\n\n# Green and sustainable banking\n\nClimate change is one of the major risks threatening the well-being of mankind and the sustainability of the world economy. The financial sector in which banks operate, being an integral part of the society, will also be impacted and hence should be more proactive in managing climate risks. The HKMA is committed to exploring ways to address this challenge. Against this background, the HKMA unveiled in May a number of measures for promoting the development of green finance in Hong Kong, including the adoption of a three-phased approach to promote green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nAs the investment manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA believes that the concept of responsible investment (RI) is highly relevant to its investment work. As the HKMA is one of the world’s largest asset owners, it will have a major impact on how fund managers pick assets.\n\n# Our Beliefs\n\nThe HKMA sees RI as an investment approach that takes into account the impact of various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on long-term investment returns and their sustainability. The HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on RI and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with the ESG-related matters of its underlying investments.\n\n# Our Principles\n\nThe HKMA’s guiding principle is that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments. Where appropriate, the HKMA adopts in its investment process the following RI principles that underpin its beliefs as a responsible long-term investor:\n\n# Integration\n\nThe HKMA incorporates ESG factors into its investment analysis processes to identify risks and opportunities, as it believes that these factors can materially affect the long-term value of its investments. Specifically, the HKMA has been integrating ESG factors into its investment process for both public and private market investments. For public market investments, the HKMA incorporates ESG factors in its credit risk analysis of bond investment. External managers that share the HKMA’s RI beliefs are selected and appointed. The HKMA communicates its RI beliefs to all its external managers and expects them to align in such a way that the overall sustainable long-term economic performance target is attainable. For private market investments, the ESG policies and practices of the HKMA’s general partners are examined as part of its due diligence process.\n\n# Active ownership\n\nThe HKMA exercises shareholder rights in its public equity holding in a manner that helps safeguard the long-term value of its investments. The HKMA believes that responsible corporate behaviour guided by ESG factors will help create shareholder value in the long term. The HKMA’s asset managers are expected to help the HKMA discharge its ownership responsibilities in the underlying investments by adopting active ownership through exercising voting rights and engaging with the corporates concerned.\n\n# Collaboration\n\nThe HKMA seeks to join hands with like-minded investors and regulators to promote good practices for the long-term management of investments. It participates in and speaks at public events to share views and encourage the investment community to adopt RI.\n\nSee the Reserves Management chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on RI during the year.\n\n# Promoting financial inclusion\n\nThe HKMA attaches great importance to financial inclusion and has been making significant effort in promoting access to basic banking services by different segments of the society to meet the basic daily needs of the general public and the operational needs of legitimate businesses. In particular, the HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry on the following priority areas:\n\n- Encouraging banks to launch more physical banking facilities and develop digital and innovative channels for the delivery of basic banking services to serve the general public, particularly residents of remote areas and public housing estates, and the elderly;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank accounts to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n\n- Enhancing the accessibility of banking services to specific customer groups, for example, customers with disabilities and ethnic minorities;\n\n- Facilitating and monitoring the accessibility of bank credit to SMEs; and\n\n- Granting authorization to eight virtual banks, which will play an active role in promoting financial inclusion in delivering their banking services.\n\n# COMMUNITY\n\n# Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe HKMA promotes financial literacy through various channels. Apart from running educational programmes to promote smart and responsible use of banking and financial services by the public, the HKMA features on its revamped official website a new dedicated section on “Smart Consumers”, where the public can find useful information and smart tips on a wide range of banking and related products and services. Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter are used in addition to the HKMA official website and publications to provide up-to-date information on banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, serving as the HKMA’s major public education and research resource since 2003, introduces the work of the HKMA to the community and promotes public awareness of monetary and banking matters. Educational guided tours are offered daily for group visitors from schools and non-profit making organisations. public education seminars and other activities are also organised for students to enhance their financial knowledge and literacy. In addition, the HKMA works closely with the Investor and Financial Education Council to promote financial literacy in Hong Kong via its financial education platform, The Chin Family.\n\nSee the Corporate Functions chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial literacy during the year. See the Banking Stability chapter for more details about the HKMA’s work on promoting financial inclusion during the year.\n\n# Addressing the needs of special groups \n\n# Accessibility of Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe 2018 Series of Banknotes retains accessibility features used in the previous series of banknotes to help the visually impaired differentiate between the denominations. These accessibility features include Braille, tactile lines and high-tactility numerals.\n\nTo help the visually impaired differentiate between the denomination of the banknotes, a mobile app, sponsored by the HKMA and developed by the Hong Kong Society for the Blind, uses the phone’s camera to scan the banknote patterns for the denomination. The app is available for download from Apple App Store and Google play Store for free. A note-measuring template sponsored by the HKMA and the three note-issuing banks has also been introduced to measure the length of the note. It can measure both the 2018 Series and the notes currently in circulation. The template is embossed with Braille on one side and symbols on the other. It is freely distributed at voluntary agencies serving the visually impaired community.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nUnder the Coin Collection programme, the HKMA collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service to deploy the Coin Carts to collect coins on flag days for non-governmental organisations.\n\n# Accessibility of public information\n\nThe revamped HKMA official website was launched in September. The revamped website has enhanced navigation structure to facilitate easy and convenient search by users based on their own preferences. In particular, the website contains a dedicated webpage “Information in Other Languages” under the “Smart Consumers” section, which provides useful information on banking services in seven languages commonly used by the ethnic minority community, namely Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tagalog, Thai and Urdu.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to ensuring that its website conforms to the maximum extent possible to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA standard, to facilitate barrier-free access to its online information by people with special needs.\n\n# volunteer and charitable activities\n\nThe HKMA supports community services by taking part in volunteer and charitable activities. The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association awarded the Community Engagement Crystal Award to the HKMA for participating in the 2018 Love & Peace of Mind Corporate Engagement Programme.\n\nCharitable events participated in by the HKMA Volunteer Team in 2019\n\n“Yo! Let’s Walk the Road” by the Youth Outreach.\n\nArtists and representatives from the social enterprise, Arts with the Disabled Association Hong Kong, visit the HKMA office, where its artworks are displayed.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, Territory-Wide Flag Day, Community Chest’s Green Day, Love Teeth Day, Skip Lunch Day, Dress Casual Day and regular campaigns that collect clothes, toys and other reusable items for donation to charities.\n\nHKMA staff members take part actively in Blood Donation Day, organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross.\n\n# Caring organisation\n\nIn recognition of its commitment to care for the community, the HKMA was accredited with the “10 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo” by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n# ENVIRONMENT\n\n# Green office measures\n\nThe HKMA has an established environmental policy to protect and preserve the environment. The policy and implementation measures are promulgated among its staff regularly. Green office measures include:\n\n# Paper\/Photocopying\/Printing\n\n- Encouraging the use of recycled paper and envelopes;\nDistributing electronic copies instead of hard copies of documents;\n- printing on both sides of the paper;\n- Using colour printing and copying only when necessary;\n- Avoiding the use of paper cups; and \n- Using environmentally friendly paper and ink for the HKMA’s Annual Report.\n\n# Electricity\n\n- Switching off PCs, printers, lights, audio-visual systems and other electrical appliances when these devices are not in use. Reactivating the preset power-saving mode installed in most equipment, such as water dispensers, electric punching machines and shredders, after use outside their preset operating hours; and \n- Reviewing regularly the need for additional air-conditioning beyond normal business hours.\n\n# Recycling\n\n- Making good use of recycled bins to collect different categories of waste, including paper, cans, bottles, batteries, CDs and ink cartridges.\n\n# WORKPLACE\n\n# Diversity and inclusion\n\n# Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nThe HKMA is an equal opportunities employer. It believes that everyone should be able to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, vilification and victimisation. The equal opportunities policy applies to job advertisements, recruitment, terms and conditions of employment, performance assessment, promotion, transfer, training, dismissal, grievance procedures and general conduct.\n\n# Key statistics on diversity\n\npeople are central to the work of the HKMA. We value the diversity of our workforce, which has a balanced gender representation and a spectrum of different age groups.\n\nFemale representation at the senior management levels, that is, Executive Director and above, made up 31% as of February 2020.\n\n# Human capital key statistics on 1 January 2020\n\n# Quality workplace\n\nTo cater for projected operational needs, the HKMA renovated the offices during the year to create an open layout, increase capacity and allow for more efficient use of space. Breakout areas and ergonomic furniture are part of the new office design. To enhance the staff’s physical health, height-adjustable desks were offered to staff members, allowing them to change their postures easily throughout the day between sitting and standing.\n\nHeight-adjustable desks improve office ergonomics.\n\n# Staff well-being\n\nThe HKMA promotes work-life balance and cares about the health and work safety of the staff. Regular talks on healthy lifestyles, stress management and workplace safety are organised and indoor air quality is monitored. Annual on-site medical check-ups and flu vaccinations are arranged.

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n- Report of the Director of Audit\n- Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 187 to 293, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$3,874,223 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,158,686 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 91% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 9% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs). Such financial assets totalled HK$338,758 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$22,481 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group also had interests in twenty two joint ventures totalling HK$44,506 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers. Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all the information included in the 2019 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICpA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu\nDirector of Audit\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor\nImmigration Tower\n7 Gloucester Road\nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n3 April 2020\n","zh":"# 匯儲基金\n\n審計署署長報告\n投資基金財務報表\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 呈呈財政司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了交易基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於第187頁至293頁所載的財務報表，該財務報表包括交易基金及本集團於2019年12月31日的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，其中包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n依我之見，截至2019年12月31日止，該基金及該集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，在香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）下，均有真實、公允的呈列，並且已根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7節首長行政官員的指示妥為編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我已按照《金融管理局條例》第七條及審計署審計準則，遵照行政長官的指示進行審計。根據該等準則，我的職責已在我的報告中「審計師對審計財務報表的責任」一節中進一步闡述。我已按照該等準則保持獨立於本集團，並已按照該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 審核關鍵事項\n\n審計關鍵事項是指，根據我專業判斷，於截至2019年12月31日止年度對財務報表進行審計時，最具重要性的事項。這些事項是在我對整體財務報表進行審計的背景下，以及在形成對其意見的過程中處理的，我對這些事項不提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債之公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2019年12月31日，本集團的金融資產總值為港幣3,874,223百萬，金融負債總值為港幣1,158,686百萬，均按公允價值計算。\n\n這類金融資產和金融負債中，91% 的公允價值，均為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一等級輸入），或基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術估算得出（第二等級輸入）。\n\n至於此類金融資產剩餘的9%，其公允價值乃採用以非可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術（第三層輸入）估計得出。此類金融資產總計達港幣3387億5800萬元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於大量涉及的金額及估計，以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債，為本次審計中的重要議題。\n\n財務資產及金融負債以公允價值計量之審計程序包括：\n\n對不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關的控制措施，有充分的理解。\n\n評估及測試控制，包括電腦系統相關的應用程式控制。\n\n就金融資產及金融負債的評估、存在、權利義務及完整性，取得外部確認。\n\n若有引用市場價格，則會核實該價格與獨立來源是否一致。\n\n若採用以可觀察市場數據為依據的估值方法，則評估估值方法之適切性及假設之合理性，並核實輸入數據來源。\n\n若採用以非可觀察市場數據為依據的估值方法，則應評估該估值方法之適切性，以及假設及輸入之合理性。\n\n# 投資物業之公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n本集團的投資物業按公允價值列賬，截至2019年12月31日總額為224.81億港元。本集團同時在二十二個合營企業中擁有權益，總額為445.06億港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由本集團直接持有或由合營企業持有，主要乃根據獨立專業評估師的估值而定。 該等估值涉及重大判斷和估計，包括估值方法及所用假設。\n\n投資物業按公允價值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n取得並審閱本集團直接或透過合營企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值乃基於估值報告所載的估值。\n\n評估估價師的獨立性及資歷；及\n\n評估估值方法是否恰當，以及假設和輸入數據是否合理。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金管局負責其他資訊。該等其他資訊包括香港金管局二零一九年年報內的所有資訊，但不包括財務報表及我對該等財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且對此類資訊不表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，評估該等其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式顯著失實。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該等其他資訊存在重大失報，我須報告該事實。在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 貨幣局及投資基金審核委員會審核委員會審核投資基金財務報表的職責\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表應按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及按《流通資金條例》第七條由行政長官發出的指示，作出真實而公平的列報，並就金管局認為為確保財務報表能免受因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤呈報而必要的內部控制負責。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣審查局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會轄下審計小組，負責監察本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計人對審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是就財務報表整體是否免於重大錯誤表示合理保證，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，並出具包含我的意見的審計報告。合理保證是一種高度的保證，但並非保證依照審計委員會審計準則所進行的審計，就能在存在重大錯誤時永遠發現它。錯誤可能源於欺詐或錯誤，且若單獨或總計而言，可能合理預期會影響基於此等財務報表所做的使用者經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為遵照審計總署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。此外，我還：\n\n識別並評估財務報表重大錯報的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，設計並執行對應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，作為我對財務報表意見的依據。由於欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛偽陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上，因此未發現因欺詐導致的重大錯報的風險高於未發現因錯誤導致的重大錯報的風險。\n\n為設計符合現況的審計程序，需了解與審計相關的內部控制，但此目的並非表達對集團內部控制成效的意見。\n\n評估貨幣局所採用會計政策的恰當性，以及其會計估計及相關披露的合理性。\n\n就金管局採用持續經營會計基礎的恰當性作出結論，並根據所取得的審計憑證，評估是否存在與可能對本集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。若我認為存在重大不確定性，我須在審計報告中提醒關注財務報表中的相關披露，或若此等披露不足，則應修改我的審計意見。我的結論乃基於截至審計報告日所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致本集團無法持續經營。\n\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、架構及內容，包括相關披露事項，以及財務報表是否以公允表達為目標，反映了相關交易和事件的實際情況；並取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的充分適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表表示意見。我對審計團隊的指導、監督及執行負責。對於審計意見，我個人全權負責。\n\n我會向聯絡基金諮詢委員會審核小組匯報事項，包括審核的計劃範圍及時間，以及重要的審核發現，其中包含我在審核過程中識別到的任何重要的內部監控不足之處。\n\n我亦會向聯絡匯豐銀行顧問委員會的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們披露可能影響我獨立性的所有關係及其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n根據與交易所基金諮詢委員會審計委員會轄下審計小組溝通的事項，我判斷出在當期財務報表審計中，最具重要性的事項，並將其視為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為公開披露該事項會合理預期會產生負面後果，而這些負面後果將會超過公眾利益帶來的益處，否則我會在審計報告中描述這些事項。\n\n朱约翰\n審計主管\n\n審計署\n入境大廈26樓\n九 Gloucester Road 7號\n灣仔，香港\n\n二零二零年四月三日\n"}
