{"zh":"2022年是迎難而上的一年。\n\n2022年伊始，全球經濟環境一片暗淡。新冠病毒變異株Omicron肆虐，令全球經濟增長繼續受壓，通脹壓力亦持續上升。其後俄羅斯與烏克蘭爆發衝突，進一步推高通脹壓力，導致各主要央行採取前置式貨幣緊縮政策，擴大環球金融市場的波動，並加劇經濟增長放緩的風險。本地方面，第五波疫情爆發，感染個案急速上升，亦進一步打擊經濟。同時，圍繞防疫措施與檢疫限制的負面報道，更令外界對香港產生誤解，威脅香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。全年計，香港實質本地生產總值收縮了3.5%。\n\n儘管面對重重挑戰，金管局繼續致力保障香港貨幣與金融穩定，並於主要策略範疇推進多項有利發展的措施，進一步鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位。經歷3年的旅遊限制後，我們成功向國際社會展示香港已全面復常，旅客亦能再次親身訪港體驗。金管局在去年11月舉辦「國際金融領袖投資峰會」，來自世界各地的金融領袖親身來港出席。外界如此熱烈的反應，成為印證香港全面復常最好不過的證明。\n\n展望未來，外圍環境仍然充滿前所未有的不確定性。儘管如此，內地經濟重啟會為香港以至整個地區重新注入動力。金管局將繼續緊守崗位，履行維持香港貨幣與銀行體系穩定的職能，並積極尋求更多有利香港發展的機會，展現及提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。我們亦會繼續為提升全球氣候應變能力及可持續發展出力。今年除《二零二二年年報》外，我們會另外發表《二零二二年可持續發展報告》，以便更詳細地介紹金管局在提升香港作為綠色和可持續金融樞紐的地位所進行的各項工作，以及金管局作為負責任投資者及可持續機構所作出的努力。\n\n# 貨幣及金融體系：堅穩如昔\n\n聯繫匯率制度（聯匯制度）自1983年實施至今，歷經多個經濟周期，成功抵禦各種各樣的外來衝擊。2022年再次見證聯匯制度的抗震能力。在美國聯邦儲備局（聯儲局）大幅收緊貨幣政策下，弱方兌換保證於2022年5月至11月期間被觸發41次，金管局按照既定機制，以有序及具透明度的方式從市場買入合共2,421億港元。其間港元匯率及貨幣市場繼續運作暢順，反映聯匯制度穩健有效。\n\n這份對聯匯制度的信心，來自於建立多年的穩固根基。正如國際貨幣基金組織在其《2022年對外部門報告》中重申，聯匯制度的公信力建基於多項因素，包括具高透明度的運作規則、充裕的外匯儲備、審慎的財政制度、穩健的金融監管，以及靈活的經濟結構。\n\n我們深信除了穩健的機制外，致力與公眾及市場溝通以加深其對聯匯制度的了解、進行有效的市場監察，以及就不同情景作出應變計劃，均有助鞏固各界對聯匯制度的信心。我們就聯匯制度運作機制推出的社交媒體宣傳活動，有助在年內弱方兌換保證多次被觸發的情況下，有效維護市場對聯匯制度的信心。內部方面，金管局亦善用數據分析技術加強市場監察，讓我們能適時回應最新市場形勢。\n\n年內，儘管面對宏觀層面的挑戰以及遞增的信用風險，香港銀行體系仍然維持穩健，資本及流動性均非常充裕。2022年底，本地銀行的綜合總資本充足比率為20.1%，遠高於國際最低要求的8%。2022年第4季，大型銀行的流動性覆蓋比率稍升至162.3%，亦遠高於法定最低要求的100%。鑑於信貸環境面對挑戰，銀行體系的資產質素略為轉差，特定分類貸款比率於2022年底升至1.38%，但有關水平仍屬穩健，並低於2000年以來的長期平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行體系：有效監管確保運作穩健\n\n疫情持續3年，來自各方面的挑戰均有所加劇，例如地緣政治緊張局勢升溫及主要央行收緊貨幣政策。然而，全賴多年來妥善的風險管理及有效的監管，香港銀行體系得以維持穩健，繼續發揮支持經濟的重要作用。\n\n過去一年面對的一項主要監管挑戰，是在第五波新冠疫情後經濟仍充滿不確定性之下，確保銀行繼續為客戶提供所需支援的同時，維持穩健的信用風險管理。「預先批核還息不還本」計劃進一步展期，並加入自願性部分本金還款選項，讓借款人可以選擇開始償還部分本金，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n因應主要經濟體大幅收緊貨幣政策令市場波動加劇，2022年金管局另一項主要監管工作是加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。我們深入評估各經濟體同步收緊貨幣政策對銀行可能產生的影響，並就壓力測試引入新情景，以評估銀行應對長時間流動性壓力的韌性。\n\n與此同時，我們繼續採取具前瞻性的措施，促進在多個範疇的有效風險管理。在運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力方面，我們提供指引協助銀行制定綜合及全面的運作架構，以達致穩健經營，並就銀行具體的運作範疇提供詳盡監管指引，例如因應雲端技術普及而就使用雲端運算提供指引。此外，因應數碼化加速發展，我們亦加強了應對「網絡釣魚」騙案和推進消費者及投資者保障的工作。\n\n除了維持銀行體系穩健外，金管局亦致力推動普及金融及提高銀行服務的便利性。銀行對於金管局就提供基本銀行服務的呼籲反應正面，有銀行在新發展地區的大型公共屋邨增設分行及自助銀行服務設施。受到疫情相關的旅遊限制影響，許多香港市民無法使用其內地銀行戶口。有見及此，金管局與有關各方緊密合作，協助重新啓動約50萬個內地銀行戶口，受影響戶口持有人無需親身前往內地辦理。\n\n另一個對銀行業持續發展具策略重要性的範疇是提升專業能力。為擴展業務，銀行業對專業人才的需求仍然龐大。金管局在其人才發展策略 — 「連接人才與未來」— 的基礎上，在過去一年推出多項措施，協助銀行業吸引、培育及挽留人才，集中提升及再培訓現有從業員的技能，以及培育年輕一代，以建立可持續的人才庫。\n\n# 國際金融中心：香港重回國際舞台!\n\n實施多時的疫情相關旅遊限制於2022年逐步撤銷，我們作出了多方面的努力讓香港重回國際舞台。11月舉行的「國際金融領袖投資峰會」吸引超過200位來自環球金融機構的國際及地區負責人親臨香港，並獲得全球各地的關注及熱切迴響。儘管峰會舉行日期不巧遇上50年來首個在11月份發出的8號颱風訊號，峰會仍然十分成功，向世界傳遞了香港已全面復常並正展現無比朝氣與活力的有力訊息。我們很高興看到峰會產生了正面的漣漪效應，不少環球金融機構及國際組織現正或計劃在香港舉辦各類活動。\n\n除吸引各地訪客重臨香港外，我和金管局的同事體會到面對面交流聯繫的重要性，因此盡可能親身代表香港出席主要國際會議，積極參與全球政策討論，並藉外訪機會與環球金融機構的集團管理層會面，加深他們對香港穩健的金融體系以及在「一國兩制」下香港提供的各種機遇的了解。\n\n為確保香港保持作為國際金融中心的競爭力，我們在金融科技、內地機遇，以及綠色和可持續金融等策略性重點領域不斷開拓市場新界限。我們亦進一步加強本港的金融平台，提供頂尖的服務，吸引更多企業落戶香港。有關金管局在綠色和可持續金融方面的工作詳情，請參閱《二零二二年可持續發展報告》。\n\n# 金融科技\n\n繼2021年6月公布「金融科技2025」策略，2022年我們在五大範疇均取得顯著進展。\n\n我們在「全面推展銀行數碼化」方面的工作取得理想成果。根據金融科技應用評估的結果，香港銀行業在不同業務領域廣泛採用金融科技，而且所採用的科技類別亦持續增加。我們自2017年以來逐步推廣及支持數碼化的工作獲銀行積極回應，並持續取得成果，成續令人鼓舞。我們將繼續與業界緊密合作，根據評估的結果，進一步推動金融科技在特定銀行業務領域的應用及促進個別科技類別的發展。\n\n年內我們在央行數碼貨幣方面的工作邁進重要的新里程。「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」(mBridge)項目進入試行階段，並成為全球其中一個率先為企業跨境交易進行真實結算的央行數碼貨幣項目。在零售層面，數字人民幣跨境使用的技術測試已進入第二階段，主要測試通過「轉數快」為數字人民幣錢包增值。數碼港元方面，我們將採取三軌道方式為將來可能發行數碼港元作好準備，並推出第二軌道先導計劃，邀請業界深入研究數碼港元可行的應用場景。\n\n數據可全面釋放金融科技的潛力。我們於去年10月推出的「商業數據通」正是提升香港數據基建的重要一步。作為以數據擁有人授權為本的共享數據基建，「商業數據通」能方便金融機構提取企業的商業數據，使企業（尤其中小型企業）更容易獲得融資。截至2022年底，「商業數據通」已促成超過1,000宗中小企貸款，總額逾19億港元。\n\n最後，我們在擁抱金融創新和它帶來的好處的同時，亦明白有必要監察及處理好相關發展可能帶來的風險。我們正密切注視虛擬資產領域的發展，並參與相關監管事宜的國際討論。經考慮公眾諮詢收集到的意見及相關國際標準後，我們將採納「相同風險，相同監管」1 的方式制定穩定幣的監管制度及界定其監管範圍。未來我們率先規管的對象將是那些標榜與一種或以上法定貨幣的價值掛鈎的穩定幣，因為這類穩定幣可能對貨幣及金融穩定帶來更高及更迫切的潛在風險。我們相信在訂立適當的規範下，業界將可更安全穩妥地開拓數碼金融的潛力。\n\n科技正重塑我們的未來。金管局與銀行業界正積極準備迎向這個「新常態」。我們有信心我們正構建的金融科技生態圈將有助全面釋放金融科技的潛力，並提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 內地機遇\n","en":"2022 was a year of facing challenges head-on.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the global economic environment was bleak. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus raged, continuing to put pressure on global economic growth and driving inflation upwards. Subsequently, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine further intensified inflationary pressures, prompting major central banks to adopt proactive monetary tightening policies, expanding volatility in global financial markets and exacerbating the risk of slowing economic growth. Locally, a fifth wave of the pandemic erupted, causing a rapid increase in infections and further impacting the economy. Simultaneously, negative reports surrounding防疫 measures and quarantine restrictions created a misunderstanding of Hong Kong abroad, threatening Hong Kong's reputation as an international financial center. For the entire year, Hong Kong's real gross domestic product contracted by 3.5%.\n\nDespite facing numerous challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority remains committed to safeguarding Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and has implemented several beneficial measures across key strategic areas to further solidify Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. Following three years of travel restrictions, we have successfully demonstrated to the international community that Hong Kong has fully returned to normal, and visitors can once again experience the city firsthand. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted the “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit” in November last year, which was attended in person by financial leaders from around the world. This enthusiastic response from the international community is the best testament to Hong Kong’s full recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, the external environment remains fraught with unprecedented uncertainty. Nevertheless, the mainland China's economic recovery will inject fresh momentum into Hong Kong and the broader region. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to steadfastly fulfill its role in maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems, and actively seek opportunities to promote Hong Kong’s development and enhance its competitiveness as an international financial center. We will also continue to contribute to enhancing global climate resilience and sustainable development. In addition to the 2022 Annual Report, we will publish a separate 2022 Sustainability Report to provide a more detailed account of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s efforts in bolstering Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub, as well as our endeavors as a responsible investor and sustainable organization.\n\n# Monetary and Financial Systems: As Solid as Ever\n\nThe linked exchange rate system (managed float) has been in operation since 1983 and has withstood numerous economic cycles and a wide range of external shocks. In 2022, it once again demonstrated its resilience. Under the significant tightening of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the guaranteed exchange rate band was triggered 41 times between May and November 2022. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in accordance with established mechanisms, purchased a total of HKD 242.1 billion from the market in an orderly and transparent manner. Throughout this period, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money market continued to function smoothly, reflecting the stability and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system.\n\nThis confidence in the linked exchange rate system stems from a solid foundation built over many years. As the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed in its \"Report on External Reserves 2022,\" the credibility of the linked exchange rate system is based on several factors, including transparent operating rules, ample foreign exchange reserves, prudent fiscal policies, sound financial regulation, and a flexible economic structure.\n\nWe firmly believe that, in addition to robust mechanisms, actively communicating with the public and the market to deepen their understanding of the linked exchange rate system, conducting effective market surveillance, and developing contingency plans for different scenarios will all help consolidate confidence in the system across various sectors. Our social media promotional campaign introducing the linked exchange rate system’s operational mechanisms has helped effectively maintain market confidence in the system despite the linked exchange rate assurance being triggered multiple times this year. Internally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also utilizes data analysis technology to strengthen market surveillance, allowing us to respond promptly to the latest market developments.\n\nWithin the year, despite facing macroeconomic challenges and increasing credit risks, Hong Kong's banking system remained robust, with ample capital and liquidity. As of the end of 2022, local banks' combined capital adequacy ratio was 20.1%, well above the international minimum requirement of 8%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidity coverage ratio of large banks rose slightly to 162.3%, also significantly exceeding the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. Given the challenges facing the credit environment, the asset quality of the banking system deteriorated slightly, with the specific non-performing loan ratio rising to 1.38% at the end of 2022, but this level remains sound and below the long-term average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking System: Effective Regulation Ensures Stable Operation\n\nThe pandemic has continued for three years, and challenges from all quarters have intensified, such as escalating geopolitical tensions and tightening monetary policies by major central banks. However, thanks to sound risk management and effective regulation over the years, Hong Kong's banking system has remained robust and continues to play a vital role in supporting the economy.\n\nA major regulatory challenge over the past year has been ensuring that banks continue to provide the support their customers need while maintaining sound credit risk management, all against a backdrop of ongoing economic uncertainty following the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \"advance approval of interest payment without principal repayment\" program has been extended, and a voluntary partial principal repayment option has been added, allowing borrowers to choose to begin repaying a portion of the principal and helping customers prepare for a return to normal repayment schedules.\n\nIn response to increased market volatility stemming from significant tightening of monetary policies by major economies, a key regulatory focus for the Financial Supervisory Authority in 2022 has been strengthening the monitoring of banks’ market and liquidity risk exposures. We have conducted an in-depth assessment of the potential impact of synchronized monetary tightening across various economies on banks, and have introduced new scenarios in stress testing to evaluate banks’ resilience to prolonged liquidity pressures.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to implement proactive measures to promote effective risk management across various areas. In terms of operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, we provide guidance to banks in developing comprehensive and robust operational frameworks to ensure stable operations, and offer detailed regulatory guidance tailored to specific operational areas of banks, such as providing guidance on the use of cloud computing in response to the widespread adoption of cloud technology. Furthermore, in response to the accelerated development of digitalization, we have strengthened our efforts to combat “phishing” scams and promote consumer and investor protection.\n\nBesides maintaining the stability of the banking system, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau is also committed to promoting financial inclusion and enhancing the convenience of banking services. Banks have responded positively to the Bureau's call for providing basic banking services, with some establishing branches and self-service banking facilities in large public housing estates in newly developed areas. Due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic, many Hong Kong citizens have been unable to use their mainland bank accounts. Recognizing this, the Bureau has worked closely with relevant parties to reactivate approximately 500,000 mainland bank accounts, allowing affected account holders to avoid traveling to mainland China to complete the process.\n\nAnother area of strategic importance for the continued development of the banking sector is enhancing professional capabilities. The industry’s demand for skilled professionals remains substantial as it seeks to expand its operations. Building on its talent development strategy – “Connecting Talent with the Future” – the Financial Supervisory Commission has launched several measures over the past year to help the banking sector attract, nurture, and retain talent, focusing on upskilling and reskilling existing employees, as well as cultivating the next generation to build a sustainable talent pool.\n\n# International Finance Centre: Hong Kong Returns to the Global Stage!\n\nAfter gradually lifting the COVID-related travel restrictions implemented for a long time in 2022, we have made extensive efforts to bring Hong Kong back to the international stage. The \"Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit\" held in November attracted over 200 senior executives from global financial institutions, both international and regional, to Hong Kong, garnering widespread attention and enthusiastic responses worldwide. Despite the unfortunate timing coinciding with the first No. 8 typhoon signal issued in November in 50 years, the summit was a resounding success, effectively conveying to the world that Hong Kong has fully returned to normal and is demonstrating remarkable vitality and dynamism. We are pleased to see the summit has generated positive ripple effects, with numerous global financial institutions and international organizations currently hosting or planning to host various events in Hong Kong.\n\nBeyond attracting visitors to return to Hong Kong, my colleagues at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and I have realized the importance of face-to-face communication and connection. Therefore, I strive to represent Hong Kong in person at major international conferences, actively participate in global policy discussions, and use overseas trips as opportunities to meet with the management teams of global financial institutions to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong’s robust financial system and the various opportunities offered under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong maintains its competitiveness as an international financial center, we are continuously exploring new markets in strategic focus areas such as financial technology, opportunities in the Mainland, and green and sustainable finance. We are also further strengthening Hong Kong’s financial platforms to provide top-tier services and attract more businesses to establish themselves here. For details on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s work in green and sustainable finance, please refer to the “Sustainable Development Report 2022.”\n\n# Financial technology\n\nFollowing the release of the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy in June 2021, we have made significant progress in all five key areas in 2022.\n\nOur work in promoting the comprehensive digitalization of banking has yielded excellent results. According to the assessment of fintech applications, the banking sector in Hong Kong has widely adopted fintech across various business areas, and the categories of technology utilized continue to expand. Our phased promotion and support of digitalization since 2017 have been met with positive responses from banks and have consistently produced encouraging results. We will continue to work closely with the industry, and based on the assessment findings, further promote the application of fintech in specific banking business areas and foster the development of individual technology categories.\n\nWithin the year, our work on central bank digital currency has reached a significant new milestone. The \"Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Cross-Border Network\" (mBridge) project has entered a pilot phase and become one of the world’s leading central bank digital currency projects to conduct real-world settlements for cross-border corporate transactions. On the retail front, technical testing for the cross-border use of the digital RMB has entered its second phase, primarily testing the top-up of digital RMB wallets through Faster Payment System. Regarding digital Hong Kong dollars, we will adopt a three-track approach to prepare for the potential future issuance of digital Hong Kong dollars and will launch a pilot program for the second track, inviting industry players to explore viable application scenarios for digital Hong Kong dollars.\n\nData can fully unlock the potential of financial technology. Our “Business Data Interchange,” launched in October last year, is an important step in enhancing Hong Kong’s data infrastructure. As a shared data infrastructure based on data owner authorization, “Business Data Interchange” facilitates financial institutions in extracting business data from companies, making it easier for businesses (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) to obtain financing. As of the end of 2022, “Business Data Interchange” has facilitated over 1,000 SME loans, with a total value exceeding HKD 1.9 billion.\n\nWhile embracing financial innovation and its benefits, we also recognize the need to monitor and address the risks associated with its development. We are closely watching the evolution of the virtual asset space and participating in international discussions on related regulatory matters. After considering the feedback received from public consultation and relevant international standards, we will adopt a “same risk, same regulation” approach to formulate a regulatory regime for stablecoins and define its scope. Our initial focus will be on stablecoins that claim to be pegged to one or more fiat currencies, as these pose potentially higher and more immediate risks to monetary and financial stability. We believe that, with appropriate regulations in place, the industry will be able to more safely and securely unlock the potential of digital finance.\n\nTechnology is reshaping our future. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the banking sector are actively preparing for this \"new normal.\" We are confident that the fintech ecosystem we are building will help fully unlock the potential of fintech and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness as an international financial center.\n\n# Opportunities in Mainland China\n"}

The labor market initially deteriorated before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Benefiting from the full resumption of travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economy is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\nHong Kong's banking system remained robust in 2022, with ample capital and liquidity, and continued to maintain a healthy asset quality.\n\n# Currency Stability\n\nAs the United States tightens its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar has weakened, triggering the linked exchange rate assurance scheme multiple times this year. However, Hong Kong's foreign exchange and money markets have continued to operate in an orderly and smooth manner, repeatedly demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system.\n\n# Inventory Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across various asset classes declining simultaneously. The foreign exchange fund recorded an overall investment return of negative 4.5%, a relatively mild loss compared to the performance of most multi-asset funds in the market.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Authority continues to promote responsible investing and asset diversification. Meanwhile, the internal rate of return of the Long-Term Growth Portfolio has been 12.6% annually since its investments began in 2009.\n\n# Banking system stability\n\nFaced with increasing volatility in financial markets, the Financial Supervisory Commission is strengthening its oversight of banks' credit and market risk management, and working closely with banks to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities, in response to the continued rise in cyber threats and the accelerated pace of digital transformation in the banking sector.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Authority has further introduced consumer protection measures regarding \"buy now, pay later\" products and arrangements for refinancing mortgages. In addition, the Authority has collaborated with other regulatory bodies to develop a regulatory framework for virtual assets, issued guidance on the distribution of investment products, and launched a new trust business regulatory system. A \"credit data platform\" under the \"multiple credit data service providers\" model for personal credit data was also activated within the year.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) continues to collaborate with banks to enhance Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CTF) ecosystem, strengthen measures to respond to fraud, and further promote the application of data and technology through the “AML Regulatory Technology (RegTech) Lab” series, as well as accelerate the HKMA’s adoption of regulatory technology in its AML work.\n\nThe Monetary Authority has made good progress in implementing international regulatory standards, such as capital adequacy and disclosure standards, locally. It is also working with the banking sector to build a sustainable talent pool and enhance employee skills for future development.\n\nTo ensure Hong Kong has credible resolution mechanisms, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has established new resolution standards, conducted regional crisis simulation exercises, and established a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources at all banks of local systemic importance, marking an important milestone in the development of resolution mechanisms.\n\n# Hong Kong's Status as an International Financial Centre\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit was a success, solidifying Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub and generating positive ripple effects.\n\nThe currency swap agreement between the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been optimized this year, further solidifying Hong Kong's position as a global hub for offshore Renminbi business. The Monetary Authority is also working with other regulatory bodies and stakeholders to prepare for the launch of \"Cross-Border Interbank Payment System\" (CIPS) and to introduce a dual-counter model for market makers facilitating the trading of Renminbi-denominated stocks in Hong Kong.

{"zh":"# 2023年工作重點及前瞻\n\n儘管香港經濟在2023 年初出現復甦跡象，但外圍環境仍然充滿挑戰及不確定性。近期美國和歐洲的銀行業受壓，個別美國本土銀行在2023 年3 月倒閉，對環球金融市場造成漣漪效應，而主要央行收緊貨幣政策，很有可能令2023 年全球經濟增長放緩甚或衰退。另一方面，地緣政治局勢緊張，以及去全球化的威脅持續，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。儘管如此，香港金融體系憑藉多年來所建立穩健的抗震能力及充裕的緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。\n\n金管局非常重視保障貨幣及金融穩定。展望未來，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局會保持警惕，力求迅速辨識正浮現的風險，並靈活應對。與此同時，金管局會繼續把握機遇及創造政策空間，進一步提升香港作為主要國際金融中心的地位。面對充滿挑戰的投資環境，金管局在管理外匯基金時會繼續審慎投資，同時保持足夠靈活性，按需要採取防禦措施，並維持高流動性。\n\n# 金融體系保持穩定健全\n\n環球經濟前景仍受制於重大的不確定因素。金管局會密切注視最新發展，提高警覺，防範各種潛在風險，以維持金融體系穩定健全；這是關乎持續提供關鍵金融服務的先決條件，因此亦是維繫香港經濟正常運作的命脈。\n\n# 對潛在風險保持警惕\n\n在2023年，美國利率未來走勢的不確定性，以及在先進經濟體銀行體系出現的壓力，可能會對主要先進經濟體的增長前景帶來下行風險。此外，持續的地緣政治風險，可能會繼續拖累全球貿易，並會令環球金融市場不時出現波動。然而，香港金融體系憑藉過去多年所建立的抗震能力及緩衝，有足夠能力抵禦不利衝擊。金管局亦有能力、資源及決心維持香港貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n金管局將繼續密切注視本地及外圍環境的風險與脆弱性，並會按需要採取適當措施維持香港的貨幣及金融體系穩定。金管局亦會研究對香港經濟有影響的事項，以及評估與這些事項相關的潛在風險。\n\n# 保持銀行體系穩定\n\n鑑於地緣政治緊張局勢升級，以及各主要央行大幅加息以遏抑通脹，預計2023年銀行業的經營環境仍然充滿挑戰。另一方面，科技發展迅速及數碼化對銀行業來說既有危又有機。面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，金管局致力透過持續的監管工作確保銀行具足夠能力抵禦衝擊。與此同時，金管局亦會參照國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用、流動性及市場風險\n\n在2023年，金管局將繼續密切注視認可機構的資產質素，並聚焦於認可機構的貸款分類及撥備做法，以及對財務狀況較差的借款人的管理。金管局亦會加強其監察系統，並採取積極措施確保銀行體系的整體信用風險水平維持可控。\n\n另一方面，金管局會繼續留意企業的營運環境，並與銀行業及商界保持緊密溝通，以就最終退出「預先批核還息不還本」計劃作好準備，並同時確保暫時面對困難的客戶仍然得到適切的信貸支援。\n\n此外，面對不明朗的宏觀經濟環境，金管局於2023年亦會加強監管認可機構的流動性及市場風險管理。\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n隨着銀行在業務營運中更廣泛應用科技，金管局會致力提升銀行業的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。繼5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」後，金管局會與業界保持緊密聯繫，審視認可機構在制定運作穩健性框架方面的進度。同時，金管局將透過跟進認可機構在「網絡防衛評估框架2.0」評估下發現的問題以及檢視認可機構實施穩固三重數據備份的進展，提高銀行業的網絡防衛能力。\n\n隨着數碼化的步伐加快，金管局的其他監管重點包括加強對銀行的第三方服務供應商風險管理的監管，以及提升銀行業的數據管治能力。\n\n# 打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集\n\n在2023年，金管局的工作重點包括更新監管資訊、加強打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（反洗錢）生態系統各持份者的合作以應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（洗錢）風險，以及進一步推動反洗錢監管科技與合規科技的發展。金管局的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》亦會作出修訂，並會就「政治人物」採取與風險相稱的措施發出具體指引，從而促進業界以有效及風險為本的方法落實法例的主要修訂。與此同時，金管局會擴大現有公私營夥伴合作的涵蓋範圍以加強訊息共享，以及支持推出銀行之間的訊息共享平台，藉以加快偵測可疑戶口及防範戶口被濫用，並加強對騙案受害人的保障和協助受害人追討損失。金管局亦會透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」及其他反洗錢合規科技項目，進一步集中推動採用合規科技（包括數據分析），並致力發展宏觀分析能力，以配合其數據為本的反洗錢監管工作。透過實施上述各項措施，金管局將能更迅速針對傀儡戶口網絡等系統性洗錢風險採取相應措施，以及靈活應對不斷轉變的威脅。\n\n# 財富管理業務\n\n金管局在2023年會加強有關認可機構在財富管理以及銷售證券、強制性公積金（強積金）與其他投資及保險產品方面的操守的現場審查及非現場監察。2023年的重點將會是「跨境理財通」計劃、數碼分銷及諮詢平台、虛擬資產、環境、社會及管治(ESG)投資產品及長期保險產品。金管局在有關過程中會參考市場最新發展及國際標準的修訂。\n\n金管局亦會與其他監管機構及銀行界緊密聯繫，並按需要就銷售投資、保險及強積金產品的監管標準向認可機構提供指引，其中亦會包括有關提供虛擬資產相關投資服務的指引。就此而言，為促進虛擬資產行業可持續及負責任地發展，金管局會積極參與相關國際組織，並與政府及其他金融監管機構合作，制定全面的虛擬資產監管架構。\n\n隨着「跨境理財通」順利推出，金管局會與業界及相關監管機構聯繫，以優化該計劃。此外，金管局亦會與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及業界合作，精簡投資產品銷售程序（包括適用於資深投資者的銷售程序），以及開始根據相關《監管政策手冊》新單元及新營運守則監管認可機構的信託業務。\n\n# 監察金融市場基建\n\n金管局的目標是按照《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（《支付條例》）、《金融市場基建的原則》（《基建原則》），以及支付及金融基建委員會發出的各項指引促進其所監察的金融市場基建的安全及效率，按需要參照最新的國際標準評估各項基建。金管局會參與支付及金融基建委員會與國際證監會組織對實施《基建原則》的監察及評估計劃，亦會參與國際標準制定組織的工作，並參照國際慣例或因應市場及科技發展加強本身的監察規定。同時，如有需要，金管局會與有關當局合作，進一步加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 制定政策\n\n金管局會因應國際標準及最佳做法，繼續加強及優化銀行監管架構與政策。\n\n# 在香港實施巴塞爾標準\n\n# 資本標準\n\n金管局會透過實施巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）近年發布的標準，進一步優化資本框架，當中包括：\n- 2017年12月《巴塞爾協定三：危機後改革的最終方案》、2019年1月（2019年2月修訂）《市場風險最低資本規定》，以及2020年7月《信用估值調整風險架構具針對性的修訂》所載的經修訂資本標準 — 上述經修訂資本標準統稱《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案，載明信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整風險及業務操作風險的新監管處理方法，並引入出項下限規定，以及優化槓桿比率框架。經過2022年的多輪業界諮詢後，金管局計劃在2023年就《銀行業（資本）規則》（《資本規則》）的建議修訂進行法定諮詢，以實施上述各項規定及正值中性逆周期緩衝資本。有關修訂預計於同年內提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序，並不早於2024年1月1日生效，作為最低要求。\n- 2022年12月《加密資產風險承擔的審慎處理方法》金管局計劃按照巴塞爾委員會的時間表，在2025年1月1日於本地實施有關標準，並打算於2023年就相關建議諮詢業界。\n\n# 風險承擔限度\n\n金管局於2023年3月就《銀行業（風險承擔限度）規則》的建議修訂諮詢業界。有關建議修訂主要是因應金管局實施上文提及的《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案下的經修訂資本標準而提出。諮詢文件亦包括就《資本規則》下有關官方實體集中風險的處理方法所作出的其他相應修訂。經修訂規則的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 流動性標準\n\n金管局擬於2023年諮詢業界有關透過《2023年銀行業（流動性）（修訂）規則》（《2023年流動性修訂規則》）對《銀行業（流動性）規則》作出的建議修訂。相關修訂是因應同時期的《資本規則》建議修訂而作出，所以《2023年流動性修訂規則》的目標實施日期將與落實《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案的經修訂《資本規則》中的信用風險部分的實施日期一致（即不早於2024年1月1日）。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n《巴塞爾協定三》最終改革方案中與經修訂資本標準相關的新的及經修訂的披露規定，主要載於巴塞爾委員會分別於2018年12月及2021年11月發出的《第三支柱1 披露規定 — 更新框架》及《修訂市場風險披露規定》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發出《修訂槓桿比率披露規定》，藉修訂槓桿比率的披露規定處理對潛在「粉飾櫥窗」（指銀行在報告日期前後減少某些交易的交易量，從而人為地提高報告及公開披露的槓桿比率）的關注。為在香港實施上述新的及經修訂的披露規定，金管局亦正擬備《銀行業（披露）規則》（《披露規則》）的相應修訂，以及經修訂後的標準披露模版及表格，並在過程中徵詢業界意見。預計《披露規則》的修訂將於2023年內連同《資本規則》的修訂一併提交立法會進行先訂立後審議程序。\n","en":"# Key Work Priorities and Future Outlook for 2023\n\nAlthough Hong Kong's economy showed signs of recovery in early 2023, the external environment remains full of challenges and uncertainties. Recent pressures in the banking sectors of the United States and Europe, including the collapse of several U.S. banks in March 2023, have created ripple effects in global financial markets. Furthermore, the tightening of monetary policies by major central banks is likely to slow down, or even cause a recession, in global economic growth in 2023. On the other hand, geopolitical tensions and the ongoing threat of deglobalization may continue to weigh on global trade and cause volatility in global financial markets. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's financial system, built on years of robust resilience and ample buffers, has sufficient capacity to withstand adverse shocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority places great importance on safeguarding monetary and financial stability. Looking ahead, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the HKMA will remain vigilant, striving to quickly identify emerging risks and respond flexibly. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to seize opportunities and create policy space to further enhance Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial center. Faced with a challenging investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently when managing the Exchange Fund, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to take defensive measures as needed and preserving high liquidity.\n\n# The financial system remains stable and sound.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will closely monitor the latest developments, remain vigilant, and guard against various potential risks to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system – a prerequisite for the continued provision of essential financial services and, therefore, the lifeline for Hong Kong’s normal economic operation.\n\n# Remain vigilant about potential risks.\n\nIn 2023, uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of US interest rates and pressures emerging within the banking systems of advanced economies could pose downside risks to the growth prospects of major advanced economies. Furthermore, persistent geopolitical risks may continue to weigh on global trade and cause volatility in global financial markets. However, Hong Kong’s financial system, bolstered by the resilience and buffers built up over the past few years, possesses ample capacity to withstand adverse shocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also has the ability, resources, and determination to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and financial system.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the local and external environment, and will take appropriate measures as needed to maintain the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems. The Authority will also study matters that may affect the Hong Kong economy and assess the potential risks associated with them.\n\n# Maintain the stability of the banking system.\n\nGiven the escalating geopolitical tensions and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks to curb inflation, the operating environment for the banking sector is expected to remain challenging in 2023. On the other hand, rapid technological advancements and digitalization present both opportunities and risks for the banking industry. In the face of a rapidly changing financial landscape, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to ensuring banks have sufficient resilience to withstand shocks through ongoing regulatory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will continue to strengthen and optimize the banking regulatory framework and policies, referencing international standards and best practices.\n\n# Risk-based regulatory focus\n\n# Credit, Liquidity, and Market Risk\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to closely monitor the asset quality of licensed institutions, with a focus on their loan classification and provisioning practices, as well as their management of borrowers in weaker financial positions. The HKMA will also strengthen its supervisory systems and take proactive measures to ensure the overall credit risk level of the banking system remains manageable.\n\nMeanwhile, the Financial Services and Markets Commission will continue to monitor the operating environment of businesses and maintain close communication with the banking sector and the business community to prepare for the final phase-out of the \"pre-approved principal and interest repayment suspension\" scheme, while ensuring that customers facing temporary difficulties continue to receive appropriate credit support.\n\nFurthermore, in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Financial Supervisory Commission will also strengthen the supervision of liquidity and market risk management of licensed financial institutions in 2023.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nAs banks increasingly adopt technology in their operations, the Financial Supervisory Commission will focus on enhancing the soundness of their operations and network defense capabilities. Following the release of a new section, \"Operational Resilience,\" in the \"Regulatory Policy Handbook\" in May, the Commission will maintain close contact with the industry to review the progress of licensed institutions in developing operational resilience frameworks. Simultaneously, the Commission will strengthen the banking sector's network defense capabilities by tracking issues identified under the \"Network Defense Assessment Framework 2.0\" and reviewing the progress of licensed institutions in implementing robust triple data backups.\n\nAs digitalization accelerates, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s other regulatory priorities include strengthening oversight of banks’ management of risks associated with third-party service providers, and enhancing the data governance capabilities of the banking sector.\n\n# Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism\n\nIn 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s key priorities included updating regulatory information, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders in the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CTF) ecosystem to address AML\/CTF risks, and further promoting the development of AML regulatory and compliance technology (RegTech). The HKMA’s Guidance on Countering Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing will be revised, and specific guidance will be issued on measures proportionate to the risk for “politically exposed persons” to facilitate the industry’s implementation of the key amendments to the law in an effective and risk-based manner. Concurrently, the HKMA will expand the scope of existing public-private partnerships to enhance information sharing and support the launch of a message-sharing platform among banks, to expedite the detection of suspicious accounts and prevent account misuse, and to strengthen protection for victims of fraud and assist them in recovering losses. The HKMA will also further promote the adoption of RegTech (including data analytics) through the AML RegTech Sandbox and other AML RegTech initiatives, and strive to develop macro-prudential analytical capabilities to support its data-driven AML regulatory work. Through the implementation of these measures, the HKMA will be better positioned to take timely and appropriate actions against systemic money laundering risks such as nominee account networks, and to flexibly respond to evolving threats.\n\n# Wealth Management Services\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will strengthen its on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of licensed corporations’ conduct in wealth management, and the sale of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) schemes, and other investment and insurance products in 2023. Key areas of focus for 2023 will include the “Cross-border Wealth Management Connect” scheme, digital distribution and advisory platforms, virtual assets, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment products, and long-term insurance products. The HKMA will refer to the latest market developments and revisions to international standards in this process.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also maintain close contact with other regulatory bodies and the banking sector, and will provide guidance to authorized institutions on regulatory standards for the sale of investment, insurance, and occupational retirement scheme products as needed, including guidance on providing virtual asset-related investment services. To this end, to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the virtual asset industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will actively participate in relevant international organizations and collaborate with the government and other financial regulatory bodies to develop a comprehensive virtual asset regulatory framework.\n\nFollowing the successful launch of the \"Cross-Border Wealth Management Connect\" scheme, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will liaise with the industry and relevant regulatory bodies to optimize the plan. Furthermore, the HKMA will collaborate with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the industry to streamline the sales process for investment products (including the sales process for sophisticated investors), and begin regulating the trust businesses of authorized institutions in accordance with the new modules and operational guidelines in the relevant \"Regulatory Policy Manuals.\"\n\n# Monitoring Financial Market Infrastructure\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s objective is to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures it oversees, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (the “PFMI”), and various guidance issued by the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee. It will assess these infrastructures, as needed, by reference to the latest international standards. The HKMA will participate in the Payment and Financial Market Infrastructure Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ monitoring and assessment plan for the implementation of the PFMI, and will also participate in the work of international standard-setting bodies, strengthening its supervisory regulations by reference to international practices and in response to market and technological developments. Furthermore, where necessary, the HKMA will collaborate with relevant authorities to further strengthen cooperative supervisory arrangements.\n\n# Formulating policies\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Agency will continue to strengthen and optimize the banking regulatory framework and policies in line with international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementing Basel Standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will further optimize the capital framework by implementing standards recently released by the Basel Bank for International Settlements (Basel Committee), including:\n- Revised capital standards outlined in the Basel III final reforms, specifically the “Basel III: Final Reform of the Post-Crisis Framework” published in December 2017, the “Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk” revised in January 2019 (amended in February 2019), and the “Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework” published in July 2020. These revised capital standards are collectively referred to as the Basel III final reform package, which specifies new regulatory approaches to credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and operational risk, and introduces an output floor, as well as optimizes the leverage ratio framework. Following multiple rounds of industry consultation in 2022, the HKMA plans to launch a statutory consultation in 2023 on proposed amendments to the “Banking (Capital) Rules” (the “Capital Rules”) to implement the aforementioned provisions and the countercyclical capital buffer. These amendments are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council for prior scrutiny and will not take effect before January 1, 2024, as a minimum requirement.\n- “Prudential Treatment of Crypto-Asset Risk Exposure” published in December 2022. The HKMA plans to implement these standards locally by January 1, 2025, in accordance with the Basel Committee’s timeline, and intends to consult the industry on related proposals in 2023.\n\n# Risk Tolerance Limit\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission consulted with the industry in March 2023 regarding proposed amendments to the \"Regulations on Risk Exposure Limits for the Banking Industry.\" These proposed amendments primarily respond to the revised capital standards implemented by the Commission as part of the final reform package under the Basel III framework. The consultation document also includes other related amendments to the handling of concentrated credit risk for official entities under the \"Capital Rules.\" The target implementation date for the revised regulations will align with the implementation date of the revised credit risk portion of the \"Capital Rules\" under the final reform package of Basel III (no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Liquidity standards\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority proposes to consult the industry regarding suggested amendments to the Banking (Liquidity) Rules via the Banking (Liquidity) (Amendment) Rules 2023 (the “2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules”). These amendments are in response to concurrent suggested amendments to the Capital Rules, and therefore the target implementation date for the 2023 Liquidity Amendment Rules will align with the implementation date of the revised Capital Rules relating to the credit risk component of the Basel III final reform package (i.e., no earlier than January 1, 2024).\n\n# Disclosure Standards\n\nThe new and revised disclosure requirements related to revised capital standards in the final reform package of the Basel III framework are primarily outlined in the Basel Committee’s publications, “Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework” issued in December 2018 and “Revised Market Risk Disclosure Requirements” issued in November 2021. The Basel Committee also issued “Revised Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements” in June 2019 to address concerns regarding potential “window dressing” (referring to the practice of banks reducing the volume of certain transactions around the reporting date to artificially inflate the reported and publicly disclosed leverage ratio). To implement these new and revised disclosure requirements in Hong Kong, the HKMA is also preparing corresponding amendments to the “Banking (Disclosure) Rules” (“Disclosure Rules”), as well as revised standard disclosure templates and forms, and is consulting with the industry throughout the process. It is anticipated that the amendments to the “Disclosure Rules” will be submitted to the Legislative Council for prior consultation and enactment in 2023, together with the amendments to the “Capital Rules.”\n"}
{"zh":"# 機構管治\n\n金管局作為香港的中央銀行機構，深明良好的管治對維持及維護公眾對金管局履行其法定職責的信任及信心的重要性，因此一直致力秉持高水平的機構管治。\n\n為實踐良好機構管治的承諾，金管局：\n- 建立了一套清晰且具備高問責性的機構管治架構；\n- 實施完善穩健的監控措施以管理風險，並確保所有職級員工的行為及其日常運作均符合指定標準；及\n- 奉行具透明度及保持開放的政策，與各持份者保持緊密聯繫。\n\n# 金管局與香港特別行政區政府\n\n金管局是香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）架構的一部分，但可以按與公務員不同的聘用條款聘請員工，以吸引具適當經驗與專門知識的人才。金管局總裁及其員工均為公職人員。金管局的日常運作，在金融管理專員所獲賦予或轉授的法定權力範圍內高度自主。\n\n財政司司長負責釐定香港的貨幣政策目標及貨幣體制：財政司司長於2003年6月25日致金融管理專員的函件中，訂明應透過貨幣發行局制度維持貨幣穩定，將港元匯率保持在約7.80港元兌1美元的水平。金融管理專員須自行負責達成貨幣政策目標，包括決定有關的策略、工具及執行方式，並負責維持香港貨幣制度的穩定與健全。\n\n財政司司長在財經事務及庫務局局長的協助下，負責維持香港金融體系穩定與健全，以及保持香港的國際金融中心地位的政策。為推行這些政策，金融管理專員的職責包括：\n- 促進銀行體系的整體穩定與有效運作；\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，發展債務市場；\n- 處理與法定紙幣及硬幣的發行及流通有關的事宜；\n- 透過發展支付、結算及交收系統，以及在適當情況下負責操作有關系統，促進金融基建的安全與效率；及\n- 與其他有關機構與組織合作，促進對香港貨幣及金融體系的信心，並推行適當的發展市場措施，以協助加強香港金融服務的國際競爭力。\n\n外匯基金由財政司司長掌有控制權。金融管理專員須根據財政司司長轉授的權力，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 問責性與透明度\n\n就日常運作及推行政府政策目標所採用的方法，金管局一直保持高度自主，並同時輔以高問責性及透明度。\n\n金管局致力促進貨幣與銀行體系穩定，有效管理官方儲備，發展與監察穩健及多元化的金融基建，從而鞏固香港的國際金融中心地位，推動香港經濟發展。\n\n金管局要有效履行職責，便必須取得社會人士的信任。因此，金管局以嚴謹的態度，履行向公眾解釋其政策及工作的責任，並盡力處理備受社會關注而涉及金管局職責範圍的事項。尤其，金管局透過傳統及社交媒體適時澄清有關金管局政策的失實資訊及謠言。\n\n金融管理專員由財政司司長委任，因此金管局透過財政司司長向公眾負責；而由於金管局的職權由立法會通過的法律制訂，因此金管局亦透過立法會向公眾負責。金管局亦明白本身肩負更廣泛的責任，就是促進公眾對金管局角色及目標的認識，並密切留意社會人士所關注的事項。金管局在執行日常工作及與社會保持廣泛聯繫時，堅守盡力提高透明度及保持開放的政策。這項政策有兩大目標：\n- 在顧及市場敏感性、商業秘密及機密資料披露的法定限制下，盡量使金融界及公眾充分了解金管局的工作；及\n- 確保金管局掌握社會脈搏，並對公眾意見作出適當回應。\n\n金管局在透明度方面致力達致國際最高標準，與傳媒保持廣泛聯繫之餘，亦出版各種中英文期刊及專題刊物。金管局的雙語網站(www.hkma.gov.hk)除有專門環節列載經濟研究、統計資料、監管資源、消費者資訊及其他課題外，還載有大量金管局出版的刊物、新聞稿、演辭及簡報會資料文件。此外，金管局又利用社交媒體平台，以能在數碼時代中更有效與公眾溝通。金管局辦事處設有資訊中心，分為圖書館及展覽館兩部分，每星期開放6日予公眾參觀及使用。有關金管局與公眾溝通及聯繫的工作，詳見「機構職能」一章（第157至162頁）。\n\n金管局公布外匯基金及貨幣發行局帳目資料的次數，一直逐步增加，內容亦越趨詳細。金管局於1999年開始參與國際貨幣基金組織的中央銀行「數據公布特殊標準」計劃。金管局亦公布外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下貨幣發行委員會的會議紀錄，以及貨幣發行局制度運作報告。自1996年起，金管局網站載有銀行業監管政策及指引。\n\n金管局與立法會的關係對提高問責性及透明度非常重要。金管局總裁承諾每年3次向立法會財經事務委員會簡報金管局各項工作及政策，並回答有關查詢。此外，金管局代表不時出席立法會事務委員會及小組委員會會議，闡釋及商討特別事項，以及協助議員審閱條例草案。\n\n# 監控措施\n\n金管局採用穩健有效的內部及外部監控機制，確保秉持高水平的員工操守、審慎的風險管理，以及適當的制衡。內部及外部審計職能就監控機制是否足夠及具成效提供獨立評估。\n\n# 行為守則\n\n《行為守則》就員工的道德與法律責任提供指引，確保所有職級員工的行為均符合指定標準。\n\n# 內部監控\n\n# 運作監控\n\n作為風險管理的第一度防線，所有部門及分處均有責任評估其工作流程的風險，並制定適當的監控措施，確保金管局日常運作穩妥。\n\n# 機構風險管理\n\n風險管理亦在機構層面進行。由金管局總裁擔任主席的風險委員會，是機構風險管理架構的基石之一。\n\n風險委員會審視和商討各部門所識別的潛在及新生風險，以及相關監控措施和緩解策略是否充足，並由該會定出適當的跟進行動。\n\n# 內部審計\n\n金管局內部審核處獨立評估不同部門的管治程序、風險管理及監控措施是否足夠及具成效，並提出改善建議。\n\n# 外部審計\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》第7條，外匯基金的財務報表由香港特區政府審計署審核。審計署並無就此項服務收取費用。經審核的外匯基金財務報表刊載於金管局《年報》。\n","en":"# Institutional governance\n\nAs the de facto central banking institution of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority fully understands the importance of good governance in maintaining and safeguarding public trust and confidence in its fulfillment of statutory duties, and has therefore consistently strived to uphold the highest standards of institutional governance.\n\nTo uphold its commitment to sound corporate governance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:\n- Has established a clear and highly accountable governance framework;\n- Implements robust monitoring measures to manage risk and ensure that the conduct and daily operations of all staff adhere to established standards; and\n- Adopts transparent and open policies, maintaining close engagement with stakeholders.\n\n# The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is a part of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), but it employs staff under terms of service different from those of civil servants, in order to attract talent with the appropriate experience and specialized knowledge. The Chief Executive of the HKMA and its staff are public officers. The HKMA enjoys a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations within the scope of statutory powers delegated or assigned to the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.\n\nThe Financial Secretary is responsible for determining Hong Kong’s monetary policy objectives and monetary system. In a letter to the Financial Secretary on June 25, 2003, the Financial Management Specialist stipulated that monetary stability should be maintained through a currency issuance bureau system, keeping the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate at approximately HK$7.80 per US dollar. The Financial Management Specialist is independently responsible for achieving the monetary policy objectives, including deciding on the relevant strategies, tools, and implementation methods, and for maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary system.\n\nThe Financial Secretary, with the assistance of the Secretary for the Treasury, is responsible for policies aimed at maintaining the stability and soundness of Hong Kong's financial system and preserving its status as an international financial center. To implement these policies, the responsibilities of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau include:\n- Promoting the overall stability and effective operation of the banking system;\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to develop the debt market;\n- Handling matters relating to the issuance and circulation of legal tender banknotes and coins;\n- Promoting the safety and efficiency of financial infrastructure through the development of payment, clearing, and settlement systems, and, where appropriate, operating those systems; and\n- Collaborating with other relevant institutions and organizations to foster confidence in Hong Kong's currency and financial system, and implementing appropriate market development measures to help strengthen the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial services.\n\nThe Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary. The Financial Management Specialist is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the management and investment of the Exchange Fund, acting under the authority delegated by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Accountability and Transparency\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Commission has consistently maintained a high degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations and in the methods it employs to achieve government policy objectives, while also ensuring accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to promoting the stability of the monetary and banking systems, effectively managing official reserves, developing and supervising a sound and diversified financial infrastructure, thereby consolidating Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center and driving economic development in Hong Kong.\n\nTo effectively fulfill its responsibilities, the Financial Supervisory Commission must earn the public’s trust. Therefore, the Commission diligently explains its policies and work to the public and makes every effort to address issues of public concern that fall within its purview. In particular, the Commission clarifies inaccurate information and rumors regarding its policies through traditional and social media as needed.\n\nThe Financial Management Specialist is appointed by the Financial Secretary and therefore the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is accountable to the public through the Financial Secretary; and because the HKMA’s authority is established by laws passed by the Legislative Council, the HKMA is also accountable to the public through the Legislative Council. The HKMA also understands that it bears a broader responsibility, namely to promote public understanding of the HKMA’s role and objectives, and to closely monitor matters of concern to the community. In carrying out its daily work and maintaining extensive engagement with society, the HKMA is committed to maximizing transparency and maintaining an open policy. This policy has two main objectives:\n- To ensure that the financial sector and the public have as much understanding as possible of the HKMA’s work, while respecting statutory limitations on the disclosure of market sensitivity, commercial secrets, and confidential information; and\n- To ensure that the HKMA stays attuned to public sentiment and responds appropriately to public opinion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority is committed to achieving the highest international standards in transparency. In addition to maintaining extensive communication with the media, it also publishes various Chinese and English journals and special publications. The HKMA’s bilingual website (www.hkma.gov.hk) features dedicated sections on economic research, statistical data, regulatory resources, consumer information, and other topics, as well as a wealth of HKMA publications, press releases, speeches, and presentation materials. Furthermore, the HKMA utilizes social media platforms to communicate more effectively with the public in the digital age. The HKMA’s office houses an Information Centre, comprising a library and an exhibition hall, which is open to the public six days a week. Details on the HKMA’s efforts to communicate and engage with the public can be found in the chapter “Institutional Functions” (pages 157 to 162).\n\nThe number of times the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publishes data on the Exchange Fund and Currency Board accounts has steadily increased, and the content has become more detailed. The HKMA began participating in the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for central banks in 1999. The HKMA also publishes minutes of meetings of the Currency Board Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, as well as reports on the operation of the Currency Board system. Since 1996, the HKMA website has featured banking sector supervisory policies and guidelines.\n\nThe relationship between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Legislative Council is crucial for enhancing accountability and transparency. The HKMA Chief Executive has pledged to brief the Legislative Council’s House Committee on Financial Affairs three times a year on the HKMA’s various work and policies, and to answer related inquiries. Furthermore, HKMA representatives regularly attend meetings of the House Committee and various select committees to explain and discuss specific matters, and to assist legislators in reviewing draft legislation.\n\n# Surveillance Measures\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission employs robust and effective internal and external monitoring mechanisms to ensure a high standard of employee integrity, prudent risk management, and appropriate checks and balances. Internal and external audit functions provide independent assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of these monitoring mechanisms.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct provides guidance on employees’ ethical and legal responsibilities, ensuring that the conduct of all employees at every level aligns with established standards.\n\n# Internal monitoring\n\n# Operation Monitoring\n\nAs the first line of defense in risk management, all departments and branches are responsible for assessing the risks within their workflows and establishing appropriate monitoring measures to ensure the smooth and stable operation of the Financial Supervisory Agency.\n\n# Enterprise Risk Management\n\nRisk management is also carried out at the institutional level. The Risk Committee, chaired by the Governor of the Financial Supervisory Agency, is one of the cornerstones of the institution’s risk management framework.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and discusses potential and emerging risks identified by various departments, as well as whether the related monitoring measures and mitigation strategies are adequate, and determines appropriate follow-up actions.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Authority’s Internal Audit Division independently assesses whether the governance procedures, risk management, and monitoring measures of various departments are adequate and effective, and submits improvement recommendations.\n\n# External Audit\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Exchange Fund Bill, the financial statements of the Exchange Fund are audited by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Audit Commission. The Audit Commission does not charge a fee for this service. The audited Exchange Fund financial statements are published in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Annual Report.\n"}

The labor market initially deteriorated for a period before gradually improving, while inflation remained moderate. Asset markets also experienced pressure. Benefiting from the full resumption of travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economy is expected to recover from a low base in 2023.\n\n# Economic Review\n\n# Real-world economic activities\n\nHong Kong’s economy contracted by 3.5% in 2022, weighed down by various unfavorable factors both locally and externally (Table 1 and Figure 1). Locally, private consumption plummeted in the first quarter due to the outbreak of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. It subsequently rebounded with quarter-on-quarter growth, benefiting from the gradual easing of social distancing measures and the government’s consumption voucher scheme. Overall investment spending declined significantly compared to 2021, amid a weak business climate and tightening financial conditions. Externally, merchandise exports from Hong Kong decreased as external demand weakened and cross-border land freight between mainland China and Hong Kong was disrupted. Service exports remained generally sluggish, partly reflecting the decline in inbound tourism, but improved somewhat in the fourth quarter following the government’s removal of mandatory quarantine requirements for inbound travelers in late September.\n\nFigure 1: Contribution of components to real gross domestic product growth\nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\nTable 1: Real Gross Domestic Product Growth by Expenditure Item (Compared to Previous Period)\nNote: The gross fixed capital formation at current prices, seasonally adjusted, does not have detailed quarter-on-quarter changes.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department\n\n# Inflation\n\nLocal inflationary pressures rose slightly in 2022 but remained mild. Specifically, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate gradually increased to a modest level of 2% in December, where the impact of high external energy and food prices was partially offset by moderate local cost pressures, particularly soft residential rents (Figure 2). Furthermore, weak economic activity, along with subdued nominal wage growth and commercial rental rates, also helped to contain inflation. For the entire year of 2022, the basic and overall inflation rates were 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\n# Labor market\n\nThe labor market deteriorated rapidly at the beginning of 2022 due to the pandemic, but subsequently improved steadily. The unemployment rate rose to a high of 5.4% in April before falling significantly to 3.5% in December (Figure 3), with unemployment rates declining in most industries. Total employment (Figure 3) and private sector job vacancies rebounded, reflecting a gradual recovery in overall labor demand, although total employment remains below pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wages and labor income growth also accelerated slightly year-on-year. On the other hand, the labor force decreased slightly by 1.5% in December compared to the same period last year, partly due to a slight decrease in labor force participation rate.\n\nFigure 2: Basic Consumer Price Inflation\nData Source: Estimates from the Census and Statistics Department and Monetary Authority staff\n\nFigure 3: Labor Market Conditions\nSource: Government Statistics Department\n\n# Stock Market\n\nHong Kong's stock market experienced significant volatility in 2022. Continuing the downward trend from 2021, the Hang Seng Index accelerated its decline, closing at 14,687 points on October 31, 2022 – the lowest level since 2009 (Figure 4). The market underwent a substantial correction, initially triggered by concerns over local COVID-19 outbreaks, US interest rate hikes, and the Russia-Ukraine situation. Subsequently, tightening global financial conditions and the COVID-19 situation in mainland China, which led to a deterioration in the global economic outlook, further widened the market's correction. The stock market regained some upward momentum in the final two months of the year, partly supported by mainland China's optimization of its pandemic prevention and control measures. The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 19,781 points, a significant 15.5% decrease from the end of 2021, marking the third consecutive year of decline.\n\n# Property Market\n\nAmidst tightening financial conditions and a weakening economy, the residential property market has also come under pressure. Property prices fell by 15% in 2022 (Figure 4), and transaction volumes also decreased significantly by 39% to 45,050, reaching a new low on record. Despite the decline in prices, affordability remains relatively tight. Actual mortgage interest rates rose from approximately 1.6% to 3.375% to 3.625% during the year, increasing the mortgage repayment burden for homeowners. The non-residential property market has also softened further. With high vacancy rates, prices have fallen somewhat, and rents remain subdued.\n\nFigure 4: Asset Prices\nData Source: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\n\n# Economic Outlook\n\n# Economic environment\n\nBenefiting from the full resumption of travel between mainland China and Hong Kong, Hong Kong's economy is expected to rebound from a low base in 2023. While the anticipated slowdown in growth among advanced economies will continue to weigh on Hong Kong's merchandise exports, the recovery of the mainland economy and the removal of restrictions on cross-border land cargo transport should provide support for the local economy. The full resumption of travel between mainland China and Hong Kong is also expected to significantly benefit inbound tourism and other service exports, boosting the local business sentiment and capital expenditure. Private consumption will also improve further as the labor market strengthens. The government predicts that Hong Kong's real GDP will experience significant growth throughout 2023, ranging from 3.5% to 5.5%. However, the outlook for Hong Kong's economic growth remains subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and largely depends on the trajectory of US Federal Reserve policy interest rates, the global growth outlook, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the pace of recovery in inbound tourism.\n\n# Inflation and the Labor Market\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a slight rise in local inflation, but it should remain moderate as various factors offset each other. While external price pressures are expected to remain elevated, the upward momentum may weaken further due to slowing economic activity in some major economies and easing pressure on commodity prices. Similarly, as the local economy recovers and the labor market improves, local cost pressures may rise slightly, but soft residential rents should continue to mitigate their impact to some extent. The government forecasts overall and underlying inflation rates of 2.9% and 2.5% for the year 2023 as a whole, respectively. On the other hand, the labor market is expected to improve further with the resumption of local economic activity.\n\n# Bank performance\n\nHong Kong's banking system faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2022, including the outbreak of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the year, escalating geopolitical tensions, and significant interest rate hikes by major central banks worldwide in response to rising inflation. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong banks remained well-capitalized and their liquidity positions continued to be ample. Credit risk within the banking system increased during the year, but overall asset quality remained at a healthy level. Simultaneously, rising interest rates boosted net interest income for banks, although this positive impact was partially offset by increased provisions for bad debts and a decrease in fee and commission income. Overall, retail banking profitability improved compared to 2021.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nThe specific loan classification ratio of the banking system rose from 0.89% at the end of 2021 to 1.38% at the end of 2022, while the non-performing and restructured loan ratio increased from 0.56% to 0.85% during the same period (Figure 5). The specific loan classification ratio for related loans in mainland China was 2.21% at the end of 2022, also up from 0.89% at the end of 2021. This increase in the specific loan classification ratio was primarily due to downgrades in the credit ratings of some mainland property developers. Nevertheless, banks have adequate provisions, and as of the end of 2022, the loan provision coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of loan provisions to specific loan classification) remained at approximately 80%. If the liquidation value of collateral is deducted from the non-performing loan balance, the bank’s loan provision coverage ratio is about 140%. On the other hand, the delinquency rates for residential mortgages and credit card loans remained low at the end of 2022, at 0.06% and 0.23% respectively (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 5: Asset Quality of the Banking System\nNote: Figures cover the Hong Kong branch, overseas branches, and major overseas subsidiaries.\nSource: Hong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nFigure 6: Non-Performing Ratio of Housing Mortgage Loans and Credit Card Loans\nSource: Financial Supervisory Administration\n\n# Profit Trend\n\nThe banking system continued to generate profits in 2022. Within the year, the overall pre-tax operating profit of retail banking increased by 19.0% (Figure 7). Profit improvements were driven by increased net interest income (+34%) and foreign exchange and derivative income (+72%), although this increase was partially offset by higher loan loss provisions (+151%) and decreased fee and commission income (–19%). Under an interest rate hiking environment, the net interest margin widened from 0.98% in the previous year to 1.31% in 2022 (Figure 8). Increased market volatility also led to higher income for banks from foreign exchange and derivative businesses. The increase in loan loss provisions was due to the need to set aside special reserves for newly classified loans, while weaker financial market performance resulted in lower fee and commission income. The cost-to-income ratio for retail banking decreased from 54.7% in 2021 to 48.0% in 2022 (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Retail Banks\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\nFigure 8: Net Interest Margin of Retail Banks\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\nFigure 9: Retail Banking Cost-to-Income Ratio\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\n# Balance Sheet Trends\n\nThe banking system's balance sheet expanded by 2.5% in 2022. The increase in assets was due to gains from marking foreign exchange and derivative holdings to market value. Faced with external uncertainties and rising interest rates, loan demand weakened during the year. Compared to the 3.8% increase recorded in 2021, total loans decreased by 3.0% in 2022. Loans used outside of Hong Kong decreased by 10.2%, trade financing by 13.5%, while loans used within Hong Kong increased slightly by 0.9%. Mainland China-related loans, following a 3.7% growth in 2021, decreased by 4.4% in 2022.\n\nRegarding liabilities on the balance sheet, the banking system continued to record moderate deposit growth. Total deposits increased by 1.7% in 2022, compared to a 4.6% increase in 2021. With total loans decreasing and total deposits increasing, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio fell slightly from 71.8% at the end of 2021 to 68.5% at the end of 2022 (Figure 10).\n\n# Capital Adequacy Ratio\n\nBanks maintained a sound capital position in 2022. As of the end of 2022, the combined capital adequacy ratio for locally registered and licensed institutions was 20.1%, compared to 20.2% the previous year; the Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.1% (Figure 11). Both were well above the relevant international minimum requirements. The Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% as of the end of 2022 (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 10: Bank System Loans and Deposits\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\nFigure 11: Comprehensive Capital Ratio of Locally Registered and Approved Institutions\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\nFigure 12: Combined Leverage Ratio of Locally Registered and Approved Institutions\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\n# Liquidity Situation\n\nThe banking system's liquidity position continued to remain stable, serving as a crucial pillar amidst heightened uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Tier 1 institutions’ average quarterly liquidity coverage ratio was 162.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, while Tier 2 institutions’ average quarterly liquidity maintenance ratio was 63.2% (Figure 13). Customer deposits remain the primary source of funding for the banking system. As of the end of 2022, Tier 1 institutions’ stable funding net amount ratio and Tier 2A institutions’ core funding ratio were 137.7% and 155.7% respectively (Figure 14). All four ratios were significantly above the statutory minimum requirements.\n\nFigure 13: Liquidity Ratios of Designated Approved Institutions\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n\nFigure 14: Capital Adequacy Ratio of Designated Authorized Institutions\nSource: Financial Supervisory Authority\n"}

However, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November, driven by increased trading volume in the Hong Kong stock market and seasonal year-end funding demand. Under the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate generally follows the U.S. dollar interbank offered rate. Due to continued interest rate hikes in the United States, the Hong Kong interbank offered rate gradually increased throughout 2022. Overall, the Hong Kong foreign exchange and money markets remained stable and orderly. As a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, the linked exchange rate system has consistently demonstrated a strong ability to withstand external shocks.\n\n# Goals\n\nHong Kong’s primary monetary policy objective is to maintain currency stability, which means ensuring the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar within a range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US dollar. This monetary system primarily employs a currency board system, stipulating that the US dollar reserves held by the Exchange Fund must provide at least 100% backing for the monetary base; and when the monetary base changes, the US dollar reserves must correspondingly increase or decrease, fully matching the changes in the monetary base.\n\nMonetary base (Table 1) includes:\n- Certificates of Deposit (fully backing banknotes issued by three note-issuing banks);\n- Circulating banknotes and coins issued by the government;\n- Total balance of settlement accounts held at the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (referred to as the aggregate balance); and\n- Foreign exchange fund notes and bonds issued on behalf of the government by the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate through its automated interest rate adjustment mechanism and its firm commitment to honoring exchange rate guarantees. When a strong or weak exchange rate guarantee is triggered, the HKMA, upon request from banks, will sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars (or buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars) at a rate of HK$7.75 per US dollar (or HK$7.85 per US dollar) to increase (or decrease) the aggregate balance, thereby lowering (or raising) Hong Kong dollar interest rates and prompting the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate to return to the HK$7.75-7.85 exchange rate range.\n\n## 2022 Year in Review\n\n# Exchange rates are stable.\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar weakened at the beginning of 2022, influenced by adjustments in the Hong Kong stock market, market expectations of further interest rate hikes in the United States, and arbitrage activities driven by the negative interest rate differential between the Hong Kong interbank offered rate (HIBOR) and the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). It subsequently remained close to the weak-side conversion rate guarantee throughout the following months. The weak-side conversion rate guarantee was triggered 41 times between May and November. However, the Hong Kong dollar began to strengthen in mid-November, driven by increased trading volume in the Hong Kong stock market and seasonal year-end funding demand (Figure 1). Overall, the Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange market continued to operate normally throughout 2022.\n\nTo meet the continued demand for foreign exchange fund bills from banks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued an additional HKD 40 billion in foreign exchange fund bills at the beginning of 2022. Furthermore, between May and November 2022, the HKMA purchased a total of HKD 2,421 billion in accordance with the linked exchange rate system, responding to bank requests at the guaranteed conversion rate during periods of Hong Kong dollar weakness. The aggregate balance decreased from HKD 3,775 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 963 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting the impact of the additional issuance of foreign exchange fund bills and the triggering of the weak-side conversion guarantee. Concurrently, the total outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds increased slightly during the year from HKD 11,488 billion to HKD 12,004 billion. Consequently, the aggregate balance and the total outstanding amount of foreign exchange fund bills and bonds decreased from HKD 15,263 billion at the end of 2021 to HKD 12,967 billion at the end of 2022 (Figure 2). The overall monetary base remained adequately supported by foreign exchange reserves.\n\nFigure 1: 2022 Market Exchange Rates\n\nFigure 2: Summary of Balances as of 2022 (Prior to Discount Window Operations) and Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Notes and Bonds\n\n# Monetary Market\n\nUnder the linked exchange rate system, Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR) generally follow the trend of US dollar interbank offered rates. Due to the continued interest rate hikes in the United States in 2022, HIBOR gradually increased (Figure 3). Over the year, overnight, 1-month, and 3-month HIBOR rose by 318, 419, and 473 basis points, respectively, to year-end levels of 3.23%, 4.35%, and 4.99%.\n\nIn response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's increase in the target range for the federal funds rate, the base rate has been raised seven times, a total of 425 basis points (or 4.25 percentage points), from 0.5% to 4.75% (Figure 3). On the retail front, following the U.S. rate hikes, several banks increased their best lending rates by 12.5 basis points in late September, another 25 basis points in early November, and a further 25 basis points in mid-December. Some banks also raised the cap on new mortgage rates based on the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) during the year. Overall, Hong Kong's money market continued to operate normally. Borrowings from the discount window increased from HKD 6.8 billion in 2021 to HKD 8.4 billion in 2022.\n\nFigure 3: Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate in 2022\n\n# Link exchange rate systems\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the linked exchange rate system has been a cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system, demonstrating a strong ability to withstand challenges. Despite volatility in the global financial conditions in 2022, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and money market remained orderly, reflecting the robustness and effectiveness of the linked exchange rate system. The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the system. The International Monetary Fund repeatedly reaffirmed in its \"External Sector Report for 2022\" that Hong Kong possesses transparent rules, substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, sound financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework, ensuring the credibility of the linked exchange rate system.\n\nA sound banking system plays a crucial role in the smooth functioning of the linked exchange rate system. Hong Kong's banking system continues to operate smoothly, with liquidity and capital positions that are very ample by international standards. To ensure the banking system's resilience to shocks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has continuously closely monitored banks' credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk management, as well as stress test results, and maintains supervision of bank lending.\n\nTo enhance the transparency of the currency board's accounts, a portion of the Exchange Fund's assets has been designated to support the monetary base since October 1998. The support ratio (i.e., the ratio of supporting assets to the monetary base) fluctuated between 109.3% and 111.0% in 2022, without reaching the upper or lower limits. It closed at 110.1% on December 31 (Figure 4). Under the linked exchange rate system, while certain Exchange Fund assets have been designated as part of the support portfolio, the Fund’s entire asset base can be used to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The Exchange Fund’s substantial financial resources, coupled with Hong Kong’s sound banking system, provide a strong and robust backing for the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 4: Daily fluctuations in the support ratio for 2022.\n\n# Monetary Authority\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-committee, under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, is responsible for monitoring and studying issues related to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2022, the topics explored by the Currency Board Sub-committee included the property market situation in Mainland China, the role of non-bank institutions in the residential mortgage market, the application of deep learning in credit risk assessment, and a monitoring framework for assessing Hong Kong dollar liquidity. Minutes of the Currency Board Sub-committee meetings and the Currency Board System of Operation Report submitted to it by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are available on the HKMA website.\n\n# Banknotes and Coins\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to hold seminars to educate bank tellers, retail cashiers, and students about the design and anti-counterfeiting features of Hong Kong banknotes, enhancing their knowledge and skills in identifying genuine currency. In 2022, the Monetary Authority held a total of 15 seminars, attracting over 4,200 participants.\n\n# Hard Currency Collection Plan\n\nThe physical currency collection scheme continues to be well-received by the public. Details of the scheme can be found in Chapter \"Monetary Authority for Sustainable Development\" of the \"Sustainable Development Report 2022.\"\n\n# Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\nThe Exchange Fund Bills and Bond Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the banks’ ongoing demand for Exchange Fund Bills and taking into account market conditions, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a total of HKD 40 billion in Exchange Fund Bills in the first two months of 2022, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the overall outstanding balance. As of the end of 2022, the total outstanding nominal value of Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds was approximately HKD 12,075 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Outstanding Foreign Exchange Fund Bills and Bonds\n\n# Monetary Studies\n\nThe Hong Kong Centre for Monetary and Financial Research (the Research Centre) completed three policy research reports, published 24 research papers, and held 16 seminars\/online seminars, covering monetary and financial research topics of strategic importance to Hong Kong and the region. The Research Centre has also made further arrangements to disseminate its research findings through a new open-access electronic journal, making the information accessible to a wider readership. In addition, the Research Centre has launched a new series of publications, \"Insights from Monetary Research Digest,\" on its website, which summarizes the Centre's recent research findings and provides high-level, non-technical overviews for the public.\n\nIn addition to research findings, the research center also hosted two international conferences and three online expert forums to promote dialogue and exchange on economic and financial matters.\n\nOn April 12th, we co-hosted an online seminar with the Business School on \"Recent Developments in Macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve's Tightening of Monetary Policy, and the Development of the Offshore Renminbi Market,\" featuring guest speakers Mr. Norman Chan, former CEO of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Professor Yiping Huang, Deputy Dean and Tan Choon Hong Professor of Economics at the National School of Development, Peking University. The seminar was live-streamed across multiple platforms, attracting a total of 840,000 online viewers in real-time.\n\nAn online seminar titled \"Transformation and Policy Choices in China's Real Estate Industry\" was held on June 24th, featuring Qin Hong, former director of the Policy Research Center of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and a senior researcher at Renmin University of China, as a guest speaker. The seminar was hosted by Dr. Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economics Research and Chief China Economist at UBS. The event attracted nearly 1.13 million viewers online in real-time from mainland China, Hong Kong, and other regions around the world.\n\nOn August 25th, we co-hosted an online workshop with the Asian Development Bank and the Bank for International Settlements on the topic of \"Spillovers of Monetary Policy.\" Over 200 experts and scholars from central banks, international financial organizations, and academia worldwide participated online.\n\nAs a side event of the International Financial Leaders Investment Summit, an online seminar titled \"Inflation After COVID-19: Inevitable or Avoidable?\" was jointly hosted with the Business School on November 2nd. Dr. Glenn Pray, founder and chief economist of Global Money Observer and former chief economist of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, was invited to provide analysis. Approximately 200 economists participated in the seminar online.\n\nThe 12th Annual China Economic International Forum was held on November 23rd, with the theme \"A New Stage of China's Economic Development.\" Dr. Wang Yiming, Vice Chairman and Director of the Academic Committee of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, delivered a keynote speech on the short-term and long-term prospects of the Chinese economy.

{"zh":"# 銀行體系穩定\n\n儘管宏觀環境充滿不確定性及挑戰，加上金融市場異常波動，香港銀行體系於2022年維持穩健。年內金管局亦加強對認可機構信用及市場風險管理的監管。此外，鑑於網絡威脅持續增加及銀行業數碼轉型步伐加快，金管局與認可機構緊密合作，提升認可機構的運作穩健性及網絡防衛能力。\n\n操守監管方面，金管局加強有關「先買後付」產品的消費者保障，並就物業轉按交易提供多一種支付安排。金管局又與其他監管機構合作，就虛擬資產的可持續發展制定監管架構，精簡投資產品銷售程序，以及推出全新的信託業務監管制度。年內有關個人信貸資料的「多間信貸資料服務機構」模式下的「信貸資料平台」啟用，並推出新的強制性背景查核計劃，以應對「滾動的壞蘋果」現象。此外，面對因疫情而實施的旅遊限制，金管局協助推出便利措施讓客戶重新啟動銀行戶口。\n\n因應最新的香港洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險評估，金管局與銀行透過公私營夥伴合作（包括反訛騙及洗黑錢情報工作組），鞏固香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集生態圈，以及加強應對騙案。此外，金管局亦與策略夥伴合作，以能更充分了解及有效管理日益複雜的地緣政治環境所帶來的風險及不穩定因素。金管局又透過「反洗錢合規科技實驗室」系列進一步推動業界運用數據及科技，並同時加快金管局在反洗錢工作中採用監管科技的步伐。在國際事務方面，金管局積極參與財務行動特別組織的工作。\n\n在2022年，本地就有關資本充足標準及披露標準等國際監管標準的實施上取得良好進展。此外，金管局亦大力提升業界的軟實力，包括與銀行業合作建立可持續的人才儲備，以及提升現有從業員的技能。年內金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，改進及精簡監管政策與程序。\n\n金管局亦繼續致力推進在本地及國際層面的工作，以確保香港備有具公信力的處置機制。具體工作包括制定新處置標準；進行地區危機模擬演習，以及在所有具本地系統重要性銀行建立一層新的吸收虧損能力資源，標誌着金管局在提升處置可行性上立下里程碑。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的整體目標之一是促進銀行體系的安全及穩定。要達致這個目標，實有賴建立及維持具高度應對能力且能為香港經濟提供所需關鍵金融服務的金融體系。\n\n銀行可能因營運方式，甚或在極端情況下因失序地倒閉而影響銀行體系的穩定。作為監管當局，金融管理專員在保障金融穩定方面擔當重要角色，確保銀行有能力抵禦衝擊及應對危機恢復常態，以最終有助防止出現倒閉。金融管理專員負責對銀行進行審慎監管，以及認可香港的持牌銀行、有限制牌照銀行及接受存款公司（統稱「認可機構」）。\n\n香港的審慎監管制度並非為確保「零風險」而設。作為其中一個處置機制當局，金融管理專員力求確保一旦有認可機構不再可持續經營，能有秩序地處理其倒閉。為此，香港已設立金融機構處置機制，金融管理專員在該機制下為認可機構（以及其他類型機構）的處置機制當局。為落實香港的處置機制，有必要制定處置規則及政策標準、進行處置規劃以排除認可機構處置可行性的障礙，以及建立金管局處置瀕臨倒閉認可機構的運作能力。為有效執行上述工作，金管局採納與國際一致及協調的方法。\n\n金融管理專員亦負責指定及監察某些金融市場基建。金管局監察金融市場基建的目的，是促進有關基建的整體安全及效率、控制系統性風險，以及提高透明度。提升金融市場基建的抗震能力，能保障香港的貨幣與金融體系，避免因金融市場基建運作中斷而可能影響其穩定。\n\n# 2022年回顧\n\n# 牌照事宜\n\n年內金管局核准6個境外交易平台成為貨幣經紀，另有5間持牌銀行及1間有限制牌照銀行被撤銷認可資格。\n\n有關香港的認可機構及本地代表辦事處的更多資訊，請參閱分別載於第283至286頁及第292至295頁的附錄及表D至F。\n\n# 監管工作概覽\n\n在2022年金管局共進行183次非現場審查，涵蓋範圍甚廣，包括認可機構的CAMEL評估、企業管治、風險管理及採用金融科技的情況。為繼續加強認可機構的風險管治水平，金管局與認可機構董事局、獨立非執行董事或董事局轄下委員會共舉行36次會議，並與認可機構及其外聘核數師共舉行38次三方聯席會議。\n\n除了非現場審查工作外，金管局亦對認可機構的各項業務進行定期現場審查。從審慎監管角度而言，信用風險管理為主要監管重點之一。同時，由於銀行運用科技的情況日趨普及，業務操作風險及科技風險管理是另一個監管重點。隨着綠色及可持續銀行業在香港急速發展，金管局亦已進行一輪以氣候風險管理為重點的專題審查。在操守監管方面，金管局對認可機構的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（強積金）相關業務進行現場審查，並以專題評估作為配合，以審視被評估為屬較高風險的範疇。\n\n表1載有金管局於2022年的監管工作概要。\n\n表1 監管工作概要\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長及資產質素\n\n2022年貸款總額減少3.0%，2021年則增加3.8%。表2列載各類貸款及墊款的增長情況。2022年內地相關貸款總額亦減少4.4%至45,220億港元（表3）。\n\n年內銀行體系受到來自各方面的挑戰和衝擊，包括第五波新冠疫情、地緣政治局勢升溫、主要央行進取的加息步伐及部分內地房地產發展商的財務狀況惡化等。儘管面對上述各種挑戰，銀行體系依然保持穩定及健全。\n\n銀行體系的資產質素在年內惡化，但仍然維持在健康水平。銀行業的特定分類貸款比率於2022年底為1.38%，高於2021年底的0.89%。內地相關貸款的特定分類貸款比率由一年前的0.89%上升至2.21%。\n\n年內金管局提升其風險監察的廣度與深度，並與認可機構緊密聯繫，以便對經濟及市場形勢，以至認可機構的風險管理措施及時作出評估。銀行體系面對的整體信用風險仍屬可控。金管局的償債壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系繼續維持充足資本緩衝，能承受極端壓力。\n\n金管局在年內進行專題評估，檢視認可機構的信用風險管理，重點放在資產質素、對較易受影響行業的風險承擔、香港以外分行的信用風險，以及提供予私人銀行及財富管理客戶的有抵押貸款。\n\n另一方面，在充滿挑戰的宏觀經濟環境下，越來越多企業面對財政困難，金管局鼓勵認可機構按照《香港企業財務困難處理守則》所載的原則處理企業出現還款困難的情況，從而使個別認可機構能夠從有關貸款機構的共同利益角度出發協調合作。\n\n表3 內地相關貸款增長\n\n# 紓緩客戶的資金周轉壓力\n\n考慮到第五波新冠病毒疫情的打擊，加上外圍與本港經濟的前景仍然複雜多變，金管局聯同「銀行業中小企貸款協調機制」延長「預先批核還息不還本」計劃至2023年7月底。此外，該計劃亦推出及其後優化部分本金還款選項，協助客戶就最終回復正常還款作好準備。\n\n截至2022年底，銀行共批出108,000多宗企業客戶貸款展期及其他支援措施的個案，涉及金額超過1.1萬億港元。個人客戶方面，銀行亦批出81,000多宗住宅按揭還息不還本及其他個人應急貸款的個案，涉及金額超過650億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n金管局自2009年起先後推出多輪逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，已經加強銀行的風險管理及香港銀行體系抵禦本港樓市一旦逆轉的能力。新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數於2022年12月為57%，而有關按揭成數於2009年9月推出首輪逆周期措施前為64%。新批出按揭的平均供款與入息比率維持在低水平，於2022年12月為39%，而在2010年8月首度推出有關比率上限時為41%（圖1）。\n\n金管局在9月將物業按揭貸款壓力測試的假設按揭利率上升幅度由300基點下調至200基點。金管局作出此決定時已考慮目前的利率環境，以及按揭息率走勢與其過往的長期平均水平。金管局認為此水平已經足夠確保銀行按揭業務風險得到妥善管理。\n\n圖1 新批出住宅按揭貸款的平均按揭成數及供款與入息比率\n\n# 業務操作及科技風險\n\n過去一年金管局推出多項措施加強銀行體系的運作穩健性。有關措施包括在5月發出《監管政策手冊》新單元「運作穩健性」，載明金管局預期認可機構為確保運作穩健而應維持的管治及管控架構，並舉辦兩場業界對話，增進業界對新標準的了解，以及促進業內的經驗交流（圖示1）。\n\n金管局又就銀行營運的具體範疇提供詳細監管指引，包括客戶資料保障、支付系統運作、雲端運算、支付卡保安及分散式阻斷服務攻擊防禦機制等。\n\n因應不斷轉變的網絡威脅，金管局透過推動銀行採納穩固三重數據備份安排、監察認可機構實施「網絡防衛評估框架」2.0的進度，以及評估銀行應對供應鏈攻擊的能力，力求提升銀行體系的網絡防衛能力。\n\n因應「網絡釣魚」騙案及其他網上詐騙的風險明顯增加，金管局與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）於9月聯合推出以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的新一輪大型推廣活動，提高公眾的防範意識，又在7月與香港警務處合辦工作坊，向銀行講解騙徒的最新犯案手法。\n\n以「數碼KEY睇緊啲，撳LINK前要三思！」為主題的宣傳活動的海報\n\n圖示1 業界對話「邁向運作穩健之旅」\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n面對主要經濟體進一步收緊貨幣政策導致市場波動加劇，金管局加強監察銀行的市場及流動性風險承擔。金管局進行審查，以檢視認可機構的流動性風險管理是否足夠，並聚焦於分散資金來源及集團內部流動性風險管理的制度及管控措施。此外，金管局亦進行審查，以評估認可機構的市場風險管理架構及財資業務管控措施的成效。\n","en":"# Banking system stability\n\nDespite a macroeconomic environment filled with uncertainty and challenges, coupled with unusual volatility in financial markets, Hong Kong's banking system remained robust in 2022. During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also strengthened its supervision of credit and market risk management at authorized institutions. Furthermore, in light of the continued increase in cyber threats and the accelerated pace of digital transformation in the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority worked closely with authorized institutions to enhance their operational resilience and cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nRegarding regulatory oversight, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has strengthened consumer protection for \"buy now, pay later\" products and introduced additional payment arrangements for mortgage refinancing transactions. The HKMA has also collaborated with other regulatory bodies to establish a regulatory framework for the sustainable development of virtual assets, streamline the sales process for investment products, and launch a new regulatory regime for trust businesses. Within the year, a \"credit data platform\" under the \"multiple credit data agencies\" model for personal credit information was activated, and a new mandatory background check program was introduced to address the issue of \"rolling bad debts.\" Furthermore, in response to travel restrictions implemented due to the pandemic, the HKMA assisted in launching convenient measures to allow customers to reactivate their bank accounts.\n\nIn response to the latest Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and banks are strengthening Hong Kong’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing ecosystem, and enhancing responses to fraud, through public-private partnerships (including the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce). Furthermore, the HKMA is collaborating with strategic partners to better understand and effectively manage the risks and instability arising from an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The HKMA is also promoting the industry’s adoption of data and technology through its “Anti-Money Laundering Regulatory Technology (RegTech) Laboratory” series, while accelerating the adoption of RegTech in its own anti-money laundering efforts. Internationally, the HKMA actively participates in the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nSignificant progress was made in 2022 regarding the implementation of local regulatory standards, including those related to capital adequacy and disclosure, aligning with international norms. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority actively enhanced the industry’s soft power, including collaborating with the banking sector to establish a sustainable talent pipeline and improving the skills of existing employees. Throughout the year, the HKMA maintained close cooperation with the banking sector to refine and streamline regulatory policies and procedures.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to dedicate itself to advancing work both locally and internationally to ensure Hong Kong has credible resolution mechanisms. Specific initiatives include formulating new resolution standards, conducting regional crisis simulation exercises, and establishing a new layer of loss-absorbing capacity resources for all banks deemed systemically important to Hong Kong, marking a milestone in the Monetary Authority’s efforts to enhance resolvability.\n\n# Goals\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s overall objectives is to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this goal depends on establishing and maintaining a financial system with a high level of resilience and capable of providing the essential financial services needed by the Hong Kong economy.\n\nBanks may affect the stability of the banking system due to their operational practices, or in extreme cases, through disorderly collapses. As the regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority plays a vital role in maintaining financial stability, ensuring banks are capable of withstanding shocks and restoring normalcy in times of crisis, ultimately helping to prevent failures. The Financial Conduct Authority is responsible for prudentially regulating banks and authorizing Hong Kong-licensed banks, restricted license banks, and deposit-taking companies (collectively known as \"authorized institutions\").\n\nHong Kong's prudent regulatory system is not designed to guarantee \"zero risk.\" As one of the resolution authorities, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau strives to ensure that if an authorized institution becomes non-viable, its resolution can be handled in an orderly manner. To this end, Hong Kong has established a resolution framework, under which the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau serves as the resolution authority for authorized institutions (as well as other types of institutions). Implementing Hong Kong’s resolution framework requires the development of resolution rules and policy standards, the conduct of resolution planning to remove obstacles to the resolvability of authorized institutions, and the establishment of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s operational capability to resolve failing authorized institutions. To effectively carry out these tasks, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority adopts methods that are consistent with and coordinated with international practices.\n\nFinancial management officers are also responsible for designating and overseeing certain financial market infrastructures. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority monitors these infrastructures to promote their overall safety and efficiency, control systemic risk, and enhance transparency. Strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures helps safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems and prevents disruptions to their stability.\n\n## 2022 Year in Review\n\n# License Matters\n\nWithin the year, the Financial Supervisory Administration approved six overseas trading platforms to become currency brokers, while the licenses of five licensed banks and one restricted-license bank were revoked.\n\nFor more information about recognized institutions and local representative offices in Hong Kong, please refer to the appendices on pages 283-286 and tables D-F on pages 292-295.\n\n# Regulatory Overview\n\nIn 2022, the Monetary Authority conducted 183 off-site reviews, covering a wide range of areas including the CAMEL evaluations, corporate governance, risk management, and adoption of financial technology of licensed institutions. To continue strengthening the risk governance of licensed institutions, the Monetary Authority held 36 meetings with the boards of directors, independent non-executive directors, or committees under the boards of licensed institutions, and 38 tripartite joint meetings with licensed institutions and their external auditors.\n\nIn addition to off-site review work, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also conducts regular on-site reviews of the various businesses of licensed institutions. From a prudential regulatory perspective, credit risk management is a key supervisory focus. At the same time, as banks increasingly utilize technology, operational risk and technology risk management are another supervisory priority. With the rapid development of green and sustainable banking in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also conducted a dedicated review focusing on climate risk management. In terms of conduct supervision, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducts on-site reviews of licensed institutions’ securities, investment products, insurance, and mandatory provident fund (MPF) related businesses, complemented by thematic assessments to examine areas assessed as higher risk.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the Financial Supervisory Authority’s regulatory work in 2022.\n\nTable 1: Regulatory Work Overview\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nLoan volume decreased by 3.0% in 2022, compared to an increase of 3.8% in 2021. Table 2 details the growth of various types of loans and advances. Mainland China-related loans also decreased by 4.4% to HKD 45,220 billion in 2022 (Table 3).\n\nWithin the year, the banking system faced challenges and shocks from various sources, including the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating geopolitical tensions, the aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks, and the deteriorating financial conditions of some mainland property developers. Despite these challenges, the banking system remained stable and sound.\n\nThe asset quality of the banking system deteriorated within the year but remained at a healthy level. The specific non-performing loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.38% at the end of 2022, higher than 0.89% at the end of 2021. The specific non-performing loan ratio for loans related to mainland China rose from 0.89% a year earlier to 2.21%.\n\nWithin the year, the Financial Supervisory Authority will enhance the breadth and depth of its risk monitoring and maintain close contact with licensed institutions to promptly assess economic and market conditions, as well as the risk management measures of licensed institutions. The overall credit risk faced by the banking system remains manageable. The Financial Supervisory Authority’s debt repayment stress test results show that the banking system continues to maintain an adequate capital buffer and is capable of withstanding extreme stress.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducted a thematic review within the year to assess the credit risk management of licensed institutions, with a focus on asset quality, risk exposures to sectors more susceptible to impact, credit risk of overseas branches, and secured lending provided to private banking and wealth management clients.\n\nMeanwhile, as an increasing number of businesses face financial difficulties in the challenging macroeconomic environment, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority encourages licensed institutions to handle cases of corporate repayment difficulties in accordance with the principles outlined in the Hong Kong Code of Practice on Corporate Financial Difficulties, enabling individual licensed institutions to coordinate cooperation from a perspective of shared interests with the lending institutions involved.\n\nMainland China’s related loan growth (as shown in Table 3).\n\n# Easing customers' cash flow pressures.\n\nConsidering the impact of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the complex and volatile outlook for the external and local economy, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, together with the SME Loan Coordination Mechanism, has extended the \"Pre-approved Principal Repayment Deferral\" scheme to the end of July 2023. Furthermore, the scheme has introduced and subsequently optimized several principal repayment options to help customers prepare for a return to normal repayment schedules.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, banks had approved over 108,000 cases of loan extensions and other support measures for corporate clients, involving an amount exceeding HKD 1.1 trillion. For individual clients, banks also approved over 81,000 cases of mortgage repayment deferral and other emergency loans, involving an amount exceeding HKD 65 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage loan\n\nSince 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has progressively introduced multiple rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures, which have strengthened banks’ risk management and the resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system against a potential downturn in the local property market. The average loan-to-value ratio for newly approved residential mortgages was 57% in December 2022, compared to 64% before the first round of countercyclical measures was introduced in September 2009. The average debt-to-income ratio for newly approved mortgages has remained at a low level, standing at 39% in December 2022, compared to 41% when the ratio limit was first introduced in August 2010 (Figure 1).\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Commission will lower the margin of increase in the assumed mortgage interest rate for stress tests on property mortgage loans from 300 basis points to 200 basis points in September. The Commission made this decision after considering the current interest rate environment and the trend of mortgage rates relative to their historical long-term average. The Commission believes this level is sufficient to ensure that banks’ mortgage businesses’ risks are properly managed.\n\nFigure 1: Average mortgage loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio for newly approved residential mortgages.\n\n# Business Operations and Technology Risks\n\nOver the past year, the Financial Supervisory Commission has introduced several measures to strengthen the operational resilience of the banking system. These measures include issuing a new section, \"Operational Resilience,\" in the \"Regulatory Policy Handbook\" in May, outlining the governance and control frameworks that the Commission expects licensed institutions to maintain to ensure operational resilience. The Commission also hosted two industry dialogues to enhance understanding of the new standards and facilitate experience sharing among industry players (Figure 1).\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Agency has also provided detailed regulatory guidance on specific aspects of banking operations, including customer data protection, payment system operations, cloud computing, payment card security, and defenses against distributed denial-of-service attacks.\n\nTo address the constantly evolving landscape of cyber threats, the Financial Supervisory Authority is enhancing the cybersecurity resilience of the banking system by promoting banks' adoption of robust triple data backup arrangements, monitoring the progress of authorized institutions in implementing the \"Cyber Defense Assessment Framework\" 2.0, and evaluating banks' ability to respond to supply chain attacks.\n\nIn response to the increasingly evident risk of \"phishing\" scams and other online fraud, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched a new large-scale public awareness campaign in September, themed \"Digital KEY is watching – think twice before clicking!\". Earlier, in July, they co-organized workshops with the Hong Kong Police Force to brief banks on the latest fraud tactics employed by scammers.\n\nPoster for a promotional campaign themed \"Keep an eye on your digital key – think twice before clicking the link!\"\n\nFigure 1: Industry Dialogue: \"Embarking on a Journey to Stable Operations\"\n\n# Liquidity and Market Risk\n\nFaced with increased market volatility due to further tightening of monetary policies by major economies, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is strengthening its monitoring of banks' market and liquidity risk exposures. The HKMA is conducting a review to assess whether authorized institutions' liquidity risk management is adequate, focusing on the systems and control measures for diversifying funding sources and managing liquidity risk within groups.

This not only reinforces Hong Kong's position as an international financial center but also generates a positive ripple effect.\n\nHong Kong has made significant progress in solidifying its position as a global offshore Renminbi (RMB) business hub, with advancements across multiple areas. These include optimizing the existing currency swap agreement between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the HKMA’s RMB liquidity facilities, ensuring sufficient RMB liquidity to further promote the development of offshore RMB products and markets; jointly announcing the launch of “Wealth Management Connect” with the PBOC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC); introducing a dual-counter clearing house mechanism in collaboration with the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to facilitate the trading of RMB-denominated stocks in Hong Kong; and the HKMA launching a multi-year plan to further enhance financial market infrastructure and develop a central clearing system for debt instruments into a leading international central securities custody platform for the Asian region. Benefiting from ample RMB liquidity and leveraging world-class market infrastructure, along with various connectivity mechanisms between the Mainland and Hong Kong, Hong Kong has become the preferred platform for Mainland funds to access international markets and for international investors to invest in the Mainland’s rapidly growing market.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also made good progress in strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platforms, covering areas such as bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centers, as well as green and sustainable finance. To promote Hong Kong's financial services, the HKMA has intensified its market promotion efforts targeting stakeholders both overseas and on the mainland, to raise awareness of Hong Kong's robust financial system and the opportunities it offers.\n\nAt the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to implement the \"FinTech 2025\" strategy, promoting wider adoption of financial technology across the industry to firmly solidify Hong Kong's position as a financial technology hub. The Fast Payment System \"Faster Payment System\" continues to grow steadily, with registrations exceeding 10 million in March, and the average daily transaction volume surpassing 1 million in September.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Authority continues to actively participate in international and regional central bank and regulatory organizations, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting market development.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority continues to proactively enhance Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial center. In November, the HKMA hosted the “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit” to implement the plans announced by the Financial Secretary in the “Budget for 2022-23.” The three-day summit brought together leading figures in the international financial industry to share their unique perspectives on how to seize opportunities amidst various uncertainties. The event garnered a significant response, attracting over 200 heavyweight guests from approximately 120 international financial institutions, fully demonstrating the global financial community’s support for Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong has further solidified its position as an offshore Renminbi hub, with steady growth in offshore Renminbi business throughout the year. Hong Kong plays a crucial role in facilitating capital flows between mainland China and international financial markets, and the mutual connectivity mechanisms between Hong Kong and the mainland are recognized as a preferred channel for international investors accessing the onshore capital market and mainland investors allocating offshore assets. In 2022, the \"Northbound\" trading volume of Bond Connect accounted for 61% of the overall trading volume of overseas investors in the interbank bond market in mainland China. Both the \"Southbound\" trading volume of Bond Connect and the Cross-border Wealth Management Connect have operated smoothly since their launch in 2021. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), together with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), jointly announced the launch of \"Swap Connect,\" further expanding financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland to the derivatives market, and strengthening Hong Kong's position as a major offshore Renminbi hub and risk management center. The existing currency swap agreement between the HKMA and the PBOC was optimized in July, marking another significant milestone in strengthening Hong Kong's role as an offshore Renminbi hub.\n\nTo provide a more diverse range of Renminbi-denominated products in Hong Kong, a working group comprised of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has completed a feasibility study on expanding the use of Renminbi in the Hong Kong stock market. The working group has begun preparatory work, including the introduction of a dual counter dealing model to optimize the trading mechanisms for Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi dual counters stocks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority remains committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong's financial platform. Specifically, to increase Hong Kong's appeal as a preferred fund management center, the HKMA is working closely with the government and the financial industry to create a more convenient tax and regulatory environment. Significant progress has also been made in promoting innovation in Hong Kong's bond market and solidifying its position as a regional hub for green and sustainable finance. Concurrently, the HKMA is strengthening market promotion efforts to introduce Hong Kong's financial services to stakeholders both overseas and on the mainland.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Fintech Facilitation Office continues to collaborate with various banking departments to implement the \"Fintech 2025\" strategy, promoting widespread adoption of fintech within the industry and enhancing Hong Kong's position as a leading fintech hub in Asia. Key initiatives launched this year include:\n- Promoting the application of regulatory technology and conducting fintech application assessments;\n- Advancing work on central bank digital currency (CBDC) at the wholesale level, aiming to improve cross-border payments;\n- Deepening research on the issuance of CBDC for retail use in Hong Kong (i.e., \"e-HKD\" or the digital Hong Kong dollar);\n- Launching the \"Commercial Data Gateway\";\n- Strengthening talent development;\n- Leveraging policy support to foster the fintech ecosystem;\n- Enhancing cross-border fintech cooperation; and\n- Promoting wider use of the Fast Payment System \"Faster Payment System\" (FPS).\n\nThe reliable and effective operation of financial infrastructure is crucial to maintaining Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial center. In 2022, the four real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems handling interbank transactions, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), and the Hong Kong Securities and Clearing Company Limited (HKSCC) all achieved a system availability rate of 100%, exceeding the target level of 99.95%. The settlement services for Bond Connect’s northbound and southbound trading links continued to operate smoothly. At year-end, the total outstanding foreign currency fund notes and bonds held in the CMU system amounted to HKD 12,075 billion, while the total outstanding amount of other bonds increased to the equivalent of HKD 15,733 billion, the highest level since 2013.\n\nThe usage of \"Faster Payments\" continued to grow in 2022. As of the end of 2022, there were a total of 11.48 million registered users, with the average daily transaction volume increasing by 40% compared to 2021. In addition to steady growth in person-to-person and business payments, the increasing use of \"Faster Payments\" to pay government bills, make payments to merchants, and top up e-wallets or bank accounts for stored-value payment instruments has been the primary driver of the significant growth in \"Faster Payments\" transaction volume.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority monitors six designated retail payment systems and regulates 17 licensed stored value facilities (four of which are issued by licensed banks) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (the “Payment Ordinance”). During the year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority coordinated and facilitated communication and cooperation between relevant government departments and the stored value facilities licensees appointed to implement the consumption voucher scheme, to assist the government in its smooth implementation.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Administration (FSA) released a summary of the discussion paper on crypto assets and stablecoins in January 2023, compiling the feedback received on the discussion paper and the FSA’s responses. The summary confirms that the FSA will regulate stablecoins in a risk-based and flexible manner, and outlines the anticipated scope of regulation, key regulatory requirements, and next steps.\n\nOn the international stage, the Financial Supervisory Commission actively participates in central banking affairs and holds leadership roles in numerous regional and international committees. Since 2018, the Commission has served as the Chair of the Financial Market Workstream under the East Asia and Pacific Regional Financial Cooperation (EMEAP) for three consecutive terms. Furthermore, the Commission serves as the Co-Chair of the Policy and Standard Group under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Non-Bank Supervision Expert Group and Financial Innovation Network under the Financial Stability Board, and also leads the group monitoring the progress and follow-up of regulatory matters related to the transition of financial benchmarks under the Financial Stability Board.\n\n## 2022 Year in Review\n\n# International Financial Leaders' Investment Summit\n\nThe International Financial Leaders Investment Summit will be held from November 1st to 3rd.\n\nFollowing the Financial Secretary’s announcement in the “Financial Budget for 2022-23,” the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) hosted the “International Financial Leaders Investment Summit” in November. The three-day summit was well-received and brought together 26 leading figures from the financial industry to share their insights and ideas on addressing economic, financial, technological, and geopolitical instability, as well as capitalizing on the opportunities presented. Over 200 participants from approximately 120 global financial institutions attended the summit, with more than 40 institutions represented by their chairmen or CEOs. Participants included institutions from various sectors of the financial industry, such as the world’s largest banks, securities firms, asset management companies, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and venture capital firms, hedge funds, and insurance companies.\n\nThe summit sent a clear message to the world, demonstrating that Hong Kong has returned to normal; global financial leaders can personally experience Hong Kong’s unique resilience and dynamism and understand the opportunities Hong Kong offers in developing businesses in Asia.\n\n# Hong Kong serves as a major gateway into mainland China and a global hub for offshore RMB business.\n\nHong Kong is committed to solidifying its position as a global hub for offshore Renminbi (RMB) business, including enhancing RMB liquidity, further strengthening connectivity with the mainland financial markets, and upgrading financial market infrastructure. Throughout the year, RMB business, encompassing bank deposits, trade settlement, payments, and offshore bond issuance, continued to achieve steady growth. Encouraging progress and achievements have been made in enhancing liquidity, product development, and expanding interconnectivity mechanisms. The 2022 triennial survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market turnover by the Bank for International Settlements once again confirmed Hong Kong’s leading position as an offshore RMB center.\n\nThe Bond Connect scheme, specifically the \"Northbound Trading Link,\" remains the primary channel for international investors to access the mainland's bond market through Hong Kong's market infrastructure and financial services. The average daily trading volume of Bond Connect's \"Northbound Trading Link\" reached RMB 32.2 billion in 2022, an increase of 25% compared to 2021, and accounted for 61% of the overall trading volume of overseas investors in the interbank bond market of China.\n\nThe Bond Connect “Northbound Trading” scheme introduced technical enhancements in July, including the digitization of the process for investors to participate in the primary market issuance of domestic bonds and a reduction in service fees. These market-oriented improvements have enhanced the operational efficiency of Bond Connect “Northbound Trading” and lowered transaction costs for investors.\n\nTo enhance the supporting infrastructure for Bond Connect (\"Northbound Trading\") and facilitate international investors in managing interest rate risks related to their mainland bond investments, Hong Kong and the mainland announced in July the launch of a two-way interest rate swap market interconnection cooperation scheme (\"Swap Connect\"). Initially, Swap Connect will open northbound trading, allowing international investors to trade mainland interest rate swap products through connections between Hong Kong and mainland infrastructure institutions, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's position as a risk management center. Preparatory work for Swap Connect is progressing in an orderly manner, with the aim of launching northbound trading as soon as possible. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to work with relevant authorities and institutions to explore providing more diversified risk management tools, including the launch of offshore government bond futures, to further support international investors' investment in the mainland bond market.\n\nSince the launch of Bond Connect's \"Southbound Trading Link\" in 2021, the market has responded positively and operations have proceeded smoothly, with trading covering major bond products that can be bought and sold in the Hong Kong market and priced in various currencies. \"Southbound Trading Link\" has promoted the development of the offshore Renminbi market, particularly the significant growth in the issuance of Renminbi-denominated debt instruments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working closely with mainland authorities to study optimizing Bond Connect's \"Southbound Trading Link\" and promoting the diversified development of the Hong Kong bond market.\n"}
{"zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n2022年的投資環境異常動盪，多種資產類別的價格同時下挫，不僅打破同時持有股票與債券可產生緩減風險作用的傳統投資智慧，更成為近半世紀以來唯一一次股票、債券及主要非美元貨幣匯兌同時錄得負回報的一年。在如此惡劣的投資環境下，外匯基金在2022年錄得投資回報率負4.5%。與年內大部分多元資產基金蒙受重大虧損的情況相比，外匯基金的表現反映金管局的多元化長期資產配置，以及因應外圍最新局勢變化而作出的防禦性部署及戰略性調整，有效減低市場風暴帶來的衝擊。\n\n# 外匯基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響港元匯價，亦可運用於保持香港貨幣及金融體系穩定健全，藉此保持香港作為國際金融中心的地位。金管局根據財政司司長轉授的權力及轉授權力的條款，就外匯基金的運用及投資管理向財政司司長負責。\n\n# 外匯基金的管理\n\n# 投資目標及組合架構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會為外匯基金制定下列投資目標：\n(i) 保障資本；\n(ii) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候都由流通性極高的美元資產提供十足支持；\n(iii) 確保流動資金足以維持貨幣及金融穩定；以及\n(iv) 在符合上述(i)至(iii)項的前提下盡量爭取投資回報，以保障外匯基金的長期購買力。\n\n以上目標全面顧及外匯基金的法定目的，並已於外匯基金的組合架構及目標資產配置中反映（圖示1）。\n\n圖示1 外匯基金的投資組合類別\n\n外匯基金大致上分成兩個主要組合：支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元資產，按照貨幣發行局制度的規定為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員經濟體的債市及股市，以保障資產的價值及長期購買力。\n\n為能更妥善管理風險及提高中長期回報，金管局以審慎及循序漸進方式將外匯基金的部分資產配置於較多元化的資產類別，包括新興巿場及內地債券與股票、私募股權（包括基建）及房地產。新興巿場及內地債券與股票由投資組合持有，私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合持有。長期增長組合的目標資產配置與其他資產類別的配置，按審慎的風險管理原則及資產組合多元化策略一起制定。\n\n策略性資產組合於2007年設立，一直持有政府基於策略性目的而為外匯基金帳目購入的香港交易及結算所有限公司股份。由於這個組合性質獨特，因此外匯基金的投資表現評估並無將其包括在內。\n\n# 於外匯基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定組織的存款，利率一般與投資組合的表現掛鈎，但未來基金屬主要個別例子。未來基金存款的利率與投資組合及長期增長組合的回報掛鈎，實際利率視乎組合比重而定。未來基金在投資組合與長期增長組合的比重於2022年約為35：65。\n\n# 投資程序\n\n外匯基金的投資程序分別以策略性資產配置及戰略性資產配置作基礎。策略性資產配置以投資基準方式反映，亦即外匯基金為達到投資目標而可作出的長線資產配置。外匯基金以策略性配置作為指引，透過戰略性的資產配置，以爭取超越基準的回報。因此，實際配置往往會與基準配置（亦即策略性配置）有所偏離，而實際與基準配置之間的差距稱為「戰略性偏離」。財政司司長經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會後制定投資基準及循跡誤差限額，金管局獲授權決定戰略性資產配置及定出戰略性偏離的容許範圍。投資組合經理可在戰略性偏離的容許範圍內管理倉盤，從短期市場變化中獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局的外匯基金投資辦公室專責外匯基金的投資及相關風險管理職能。該辦公室職員負責直接管理外匯基金約70%的投資，包括整個支持組合及部分投資組合。該部分內部管理的投資組合包括不同的環球定息市場投資，並透過衍生工具執行外匯基金的宏觀風險管理策略。\n\n# 外聘投資經理\n\n除透過內部職員管理資產外，金管局亦僱用外聘投資經理負責管理外匯基金約30%的資產，包括所有上市股票組合及其他特別資產類別。僱用外聘投資經理的目的是要運用市場上最佳的專業投資專才為外匯基金投資，獲取可持續回報，並讓外匯基金受惠於多元化及互補的投資方式，以及汲取市場心得與專門的投資知識。\n\n僱用外聘投資經理的相關支出包括基金管理與託管費、交易費、預扣稅及其他稅項。這些支出主要受市場因素影響而每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理及監察\n\n投資環境越趨複雜，風險管理的重要性不言而喻。金管局為內部及外聘投資經理所管理的投資組合均訂下嚴格管控措施及投資指引，並設立嚴謹的風險監察及合規制度。金管局為投資相關活動設有三重防線，以實施有效的風險管理及管治。金管局定期監察主要投資風險類別（包括信用、市場、流動性及業務操作風險），而風險管理程序的設置為外匯基金的策略性規劃及多元化投資提供穩健的框架。\n\n# 負責任投資\n\n金管局相信透過適度強調負責任投資及考慮各項投資的可持續長期表現，可更有效達致外匯基金的投資目標，並且減低投資活動涉及的環境、社會及管治(ESG)相關風險。當ESG投資與其他投資項目的經風險調整長期收益相若時，金管局一般會按既定指導性原則優先考慮ESG投資，並已將ESG因素併入外匯基金的公開市場及私募市場的投資管理過程中。有關金管局的負責任投資框架及落實情況，詳見《二零二二年可持續發展報告》之「負責任投資」一章。\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n# 2022 年的金融市場\n\n2022年環球金融市場異常波動，債市及股市分別累計下跌16.2%及19.8%，跌幅顯著。\n\n受累於全球通脹飆升、緊縮貨幣政策及經濟增長放緩，年內主要股市指數大幅下挫。儘管環球股市因市場出現通脹及利率見頂的憧憬而於年末稍作反彈，年內美國標準普爾500指數仍下跌19.4%，香港恒生指數則下跌15.5%。\n\n由於各國央行進取加息以對抗通脹，觸發主要市場國債收益率持續飆升。美國10年期國債收益率從2022年初的1.63%一直攀升，至第4季升穿4%，達2008年以來最高水平。美國國債收益率曲線自年中開始已出現倒掛，幅度不斷擴大，加深市場對經濟衰退的憂慮。\n\n貨幣市場方面，在美國聯邦儲備局連續加息帶動下，美元在2022年大幅走強。其他主要貨幣，包括歐元、英鎊、日圓及人民幣兌美元匯率大幅貶值，其中英鎊及日圓兌美元分別貶值10.7%及12.2%。\n\n表1列載主要貨幣、債巿及股市在2022年的表現。\n\n表1 2022年市場回報\n\n# 外匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金在2022年錄得2,054億港元的投資虧損，其中包括債券投資虧損532億港元、股票投資虧損805億港元（其中包括境外股票投資虧損610億港元及香港股票投資虧損195億港元）、非港元資產外匯估值下調400億港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的其他投資虧損317億港元。另一方面，策略性資產組合錄得87億港元估值虧損。\n\n於2022年年底，外匯基金的資產總值達40,080億港元。長期增長組合投資的總市值為4,847億港元，其中私募股權為3,700億港元，房地產為1,147億港元。長期增長組合中已承擔但尚未提取作投資的總額為2,708億港元。\n\n外匯基金（不包括策略性資產組合）在2022年的投資回報率為負4.5%，其中投資組合的回報率為負8.6%，支持組合為負0.4%。長期增長組合自2009年開展投資以來的內部回報率年率為12.6%。\n\n圖1列明外匯基金由1994至2022年的年度回報率。表2顯示外匯基金在2022年的投資回報率及不同年期的平均投資回報率。外匯基金在2020至2022年的平均回報率為1.5%、2018至2022年為2.3%、2013至2022年為2.4%，以及自1994年起計為4.5%。表3列載外匯基金資產於2022年12月31日的貨幣比重。\n\n有關外匯基金的經審計2022年度財務報表，見第173至281頁。\n\n圖1 外匯基金投資回報率（1994至2022年）\n","en":"# Inventory Management\n\nThe investment environment in 2022 was exceptionally volatile, with prices across various asset classes declining simultaneously. This not only challenged the traditional investment wisdom that holding both stocks and bonds could mitigate risk, but also marked the first time in nearly half a century that stocks, bonds, and major non-USD currency exchange rates all recorded negative returns in the same year. In such a challenging investment climate, the foreign exchange fund achieved a negative investment return of 4.5% in 2022. Compared to the significant losses suffered by most multi-asset funds during the year, the fund’s performance reflects the regulator’s diversified, long-term asset allocation, as well as defensive measures and strategic adjustments made in response to evolving external conditions, effectively reducing the impact of the market turmoil.\n\n# Exchange Fund\n\nAccording to the Exchange Fund Bill, the primary objective of the Exchange Fund is to directly or indirectly influence the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, and also to be used to maintain the stability and soundness of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems, thereby preserving Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is accountable to the Financial Secretary for the operation and investment management of the Exchange Fund, pursuant to the powers and delegated authorities transferred by the Financial Secretary.\n\n# Management of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee shall determine the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(i) preservation of capital;\n(ii) ensuring that the overall monetary base is at all times adequately supported by highly liquid US dollar assets;\n(iii) ensuring liquidity is sufficient to maintain monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) seeking investment returns to the extent possible, consistent with the above (i) to (iii), to safeguard the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives comprehensively consider the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund and are reflected in its portfolio structure and target asset allocation (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Categories of the Foreign Exchange Fund’s Investment Portfolio\n\nForeign exchange funds are broadly divided into two main portfolios: support portfolio and investment portfolio. The support portfolio holds highly liquid U.S. dollar assets, providing ample backing for the currency base as stipulated by the monetary authority system. The investment portfolio primarily invests in bond and equity markets of member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to safeguard asset value and long-term purchasing power.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance long-term returns, the Monetary Authority has, in a prudent and gradual manner, allocated a portion of the Exchange Fund’s assets to a more diversified range of asset classes, including emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate. Emerging market and mainland China bonds and equities are held through investment portfolios, while private equity and real estate investments are held through a long-term growth portfolio. The target asset allocation of the long-term growth portfolio, in conjunction with the allocation to other asset classes, is formulated based on prudent risk management principles and a diversified asset allocation strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Asset Portfolio was established in 2007 and has consistently held Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited shares purchased by the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes. Due to the Portfolio’s unique nature, its performance has not been included in the evaluation of the Exchange Fund’s investment returns.\n\n# Regarding deposits with the foreign exchange fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund occasionally accepts deposits from the Fiscal Reserves, government funds, and statutory bodies, with interest rates generally linked to the performance of the investment portfolio. The Future Fund is a prime example. The interest rate on Future Fund deposits is linked to the returns of both the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio, with the actual rate depending on the portfolio weighting. In 2022, the Future Fund’s allocation between the investment portfolio and the long-term growth portfolio was approximately 35:65.\n\n# Investment Procedures\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s investment process is based on both strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is reflected in the form of a benchmark, representing the long-term asset allocation the Exchange Fund can make to achieve its investment objectives. Guided by the strategic allocation, the Exchange Fund seeks to achieve returns exceeding the benchmark through tactical asset allocation. Consequently, the actual allocation often deviates from the benchmark allocation (i.e., the strategic allocation), and the difference between the actual and benchmark allocations is termed \"tactical deviation.\" The Financial Secretary, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, establishes the investment benchmark and tracking error limits. The Monetary Authority is authorized to decide on the tactical asset allocation and set the permissible range for tactical deviation. Portfolio managers can manage positions within the permissible range of tactical deviation, capitalizing on short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment Management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission's Foreign Exchange Fund Investment Office is responsible for the investment and related risk management functions of the foreign exchange fund. The office's staff directly manage approximately 70% of the fund's investments, including the entire supporting portfolio and portions of other investment portfolios. This internally managed investment portfolio includes investments in various global fixed income markets and utilizes derivative instruments to execute the foreign exchange fund's macroeconomic risk management strategies.\n\n# External Investment Manager\n\nIn addition to managing assets through internal staff, the Financial Supervisory Commission also engages external investment managers to oversee approximately 30% of the foreign exchange fund's assets, including all listed stock portfolios and other specialized asset classes. The purpose of hiring external investment managers is to leverage the best professional investment expertise available in the market to invest the foreign exchange fund, achieve sustainable returns, and allow the fund to benefit from diversified and complementary investment approaches, as well as gain market insights and specialized investment knowledge.\n\nExpenses related to engaging an externally hired investment manager include fund management and custody fees, transaction fees, withholding tax, and other taxes. These expenses are primarily influenced by market factors and vary annually.\n\n# Risk Management and Supervision\n\nAs the investment environment becomes increasingly complex, the importance of risk management is self-evident. The Financial Supervisory Commission has established strict control measures and investment guidelines for investment portfolios managed by both internal and external investment managers, and has implemented rigorous risk monitoring and compliance systems. The Commission has established a three-line defense system for investment-related activities to implement effective risk management and governance. The Commission regularly monitors major categories of investment risk (including credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk), and the establishment of risk management procedures provides a sound framework for the strategic planning and diversified investments of the foreign exchange fund.\n\n# Responsible Investing\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority believes that emphasizing responsible investing and considering the sustainable long-term performance of various investments can more effectively achieve the Exchange Fund’s investment objectives and reduce environment, social, and governance (ESG) related risks associated with investment activities. When the long-term risk-adjusted returns of ESG investments are comparable to those of other investment projects, the Authority generally prioritizes ESG investments in accordance with its established guiding principles and has incorporated ESG factors into the investment management process for both the Exchange Fund’s public and private markets. Details of the Authority’s responsible investment framework and implementation can be found in Chapter “Responsible Investment” of the “Sustainable Development Report 2022.”\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\n# The Financial Markets in 2022\n\nThe global financial markets experienced significant volatility in 2022, with bond and stock markets declining by a cumulative 16.2% and 19.8% respectively.\n\nWeighed down by soaring global inflation, tightening monetary policies, and slowing economic growth, major stock indices experienced significant declines throughout the year. Although global stock markets saw a slight rebound at year-end amid hopes of peaking inflation and interest rates, the S&P 500 in the United States still fell by 19.4%, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index dropped by 15.5%.\n\nAggressive interest rate hikes by central banks worldwide to combat inflation have triggered a sustained surge in major market government bond yields. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note has risen from 1.63% at the beginning of 2022 to above 4% in the fourth quarter, reaching its highest level since 2008. The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted since mid-year, with the inversion widening, deepening market concerns about an economic recession.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly in 2022, driven by consecutive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan, saw substantial depreciation against the dollar, with the British pound and Japanese yen depreciating by 10.7% and 12.2% against the dollar, respectively.\n\nTable 1 lists the performance of major currencies, bond markets, and stock markets in 2022.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Market Returns\n\n# Performance of the Foreign Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded investment losses of HKD 205.4 billion in 2022, including HKD 53.2 billion in bond investment losses, HKD 80.5 billion in equity investment losses (of which HKD 61 billion were from overseas equities and HKD 19.5 billion from Hong Kong equities), a HKD 40 billion foreign exchange valuation adjustment for non-Hong Kong dollar assets, and HKD 31.7 billion in other investment losses held by the Exchange Fund’s investment holding subsidiaries. On the other hand, the strategic asset portfolio recorded a valuation loss of HKD 8.7 billion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Exchange Fund’s total assets reached HKD 400.8 billion. The total market value of investments in the long-term growth portfolio was HKD 48.47 billion, of which private equity accounted for HKD 37 billion and real estate for HKD 11.47 billion. The total amount committed but not yet drawn for investment within the long-term growth portfolio was HKD 27.08 billion.\n\nThe foreign exchange fund (excluding strategic asset allocation) had a return on investment of -4.5% in 2022, with the investment portfolio returning -8.6% and the supporting portfolio returning -0.4%. The long-term growth portfolio has an annualized internal rate of return of 12.6% since commencing investments in 2009.\n\nFigure 1 shows the annual return rates of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2022. Table 2 displays the Exchange Fund’s investment return rates in 2022 and its average investment return rates for different time periods.

The Treasury Department prepares the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, with the assistance of independent auditors and other accounting professionals. Furthermore, the HKMA provides detailed disclosures and in-depth analysis of expenditure items and budgetary data in its Annual Report.\n\n# Accountability and Oversight\n\n# Risk Management\n\nManaging the risks of currency and banking systems is one of the most important tasks of the Financial Services and Markets Commission. Risk management is reflected not only in strategic planning but also in daily operations. The Commission’s risk management framework comprises two high-level committees: the Macroprudential Supervision Committee and the Risk Committee, both chaired by the Commission’s Chief Executive.\n\nThe functions of the Macroeconomic Surveillance Committee shall be as follows:\n- To identify potential risks and threats to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems and discuss feasible countermeasures;\n- To review the existing risk management measures of the monetary and financial systems, identify any potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the measures are comprehensive; and\n- To encourage cross-departmental sharing of macroeconomic surveillance information to enhance the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s macroeconomic surveillance capabilities.\n\nThe Risk Committee's responsibilities include:\n- Identifying potential risks and threats facing the Financial Supervisory Agency and formulating strategies to mitigate their impact;\n- Reviewing the current risk management systems of various departments, identifying potential vulnerabilities and significant risks, and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to address them;\n- Establishing uniform risk assessment criteria and methods, and prioritizing resource allocation based on identified risks; and\n- Promoting and strengthening a risk management culture within the Financial Supervisory Agency, and encouraging appropriate delegation and oversight.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission has established a robust operational risk management framework that covers organizational structure risks at both the institutional and departmental levels. Institutional-level risks generally refer to medium-term risks facing the entire institution or risks requiring cross-departmental collaboration. During implementation, each department must quarterly review and report on its potential and emerging risks, as well as the monitoring measures and mitigation strategies it proposes. This is further supported by a top-down institutional risk management model, whereby senior management in each department identifies major risks with broad impact and recommends mitigation measures. These assessments are regularly reviewed and decisions on appropriate follow-up actions are made by the Risk Committee.\n\n# Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Department independently and objectively assesses whether the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s governance, risk management, and monitoring procedures are adequate and effective. Operationally, the department reports to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and administratively to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The Internal Audit Department adopts a risk-based approach to its operations and information systems audits, covering all major risk areas.

{"zh":"# 外匯基金\n\n- 審計署署長報告\n- 外匯基金財務報表\n\n# 審計署署長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告致財政司司長\n\n# 意見\n\n茲證明我已審計列載於第179頁至281頁外匯基金及其附屬公司（「集團」）的財務報表，該等財務報表包括外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的資產負債表與截至該日止年度的收支帳目、全面收益表、權益變動表和現金流量表，以及財務報表的附註，包括主要會計政策概要。\n\n我認為，該等財務報表已按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》真實而中肯地反映外匯基金及集團於2022年12月31日的財務狀況及截至該日止年度的財務表現和現金流量，並已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條下所發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的基礎\n\n我已按照行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示及審計署的審計準則進行審計。我根據該等準則而須承擔的責任，詳載於本報告「審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任」部分。根據該等準則，我獨立於集團，並已按該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信，我所獲得的審計憑證是充足和適當地為我的審計意見提供基礎。\n\n# 關鍵審計事項\n\n關鍵審計事項是根據我的專業判斷，對截至2022年12月31日止年度財務報表的審計最為重要的事項。我對整體財務報表進行審計及形成意見時處理了這些事項，而我不會對這些事項提供單獨的意見。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n於2022年12月31日，集團按公平值列帳的金融資產共38,361.82億港元，金融負債共12,074.98億港元。\n\n87%的該等金融資產及所有該等金融負債的公平值為相同資產或負債於活躍市場的報價（第1級參數），或是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第2級參數）。\n\n其餘13%的該等金融資產的公平值，是以估值方法估計，而所用的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎（第3級參數）。有關金融資產共4,876.94億港元，主要包括非上市投資基金。\n\n鑑於所涉數額龐大及涉及估計，按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值屬關鍵審計事項。\n\n就按公平值列帳的金融資產及金融負債的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 了解不同類別金融資產及金融負債的估值程序，包括相關監控措施；\n- 評價及測試監控措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用程式監控措施；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的估值、存在、權利與責任及完整性取得函證；\n- 若使用市場報價，根據獨立來源核實價格；\n- 若所用估值方法的參數是以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合及有關假設是否合理，以及根據獨立來源核實參數；及\n- 若所用估值方法的參數並非以可觀察市場數據為基礎，評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n集團的投資物業按公平值列帳，於2022年12月31日共值233.94億港元。集團亦於4間聯營公司及22間合營公司擁有權益，該等公司主要業務為持有海外投資物業，有關權益共值396.31億港元。不論是由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有，該等投資物業的公平值均主要根據獨立專業估值師的估值釐定。該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括所用的估值方法及假設。\n\n就按公平值列帳的投資物業的估值，審計程序包括：\n- 獲取及審視由集團直接持有或由聯營公司或合營公司持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實公平值是根據有關估值報告所列的估值釐定；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評價估值方法是否適合，以及有關假設與參數是否合理。\n\n# 其他資料\n\n金融管理專員須對其他資料負責。其他資料包括金融管理局2022年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我的審計師報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資料，我亦不對其他資料發表任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就財務報表審計而言，我有責任閱讀其他資料，從而考慮其他資料是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中得悉的情況有重大矛盾，或者似乎存有重大錯誤陳述。基於我已執行的工作，如果我認為其他資料存有重大錯誤陳述，我需要報告該事實。在這方面，我沒有任何報告。\n\n# 金融管理專員及外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會就財務報表而須承擔的責任\n\n金融管理專員須負責按照香港會計師公會頒布的《香港財務報告準則》及行政長官在《外匯基金條例》第7條下所發出的指示擬備真實而中肯的財務報表，及落實其認為必要的內部控制， 使財務報表不存有因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在擬備財務報表時，金融管理專員須負責評估集團持續經營的能力，以及在適用情況下披露與持續經營有關的事項，並以持續經營作為會計基礎。\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會負責監督集團的財務報告過程。\n\n# 審計師就財務報表審計而須承擔的責任\n\n我的目標是就整體財務報表是否不存有任何因欺詐或錯誤而導致的重大錯誤陳述取得合理保證，並發出包括我意見的審計師報告。合理保證是高水平的保證，但不能確保按審計署審計準則進行的審計定能發現所存有的任何重大錯誤陳述。錯誤陳述可以由欺詐或錯誤引起，如果合理預期它們個別或滙總起來可能影響財務報表使用者所作出的經濟決定，則會被視作重大錯誤陳述。\n\n在根據審計署審計準則進行審計的過程中，我會運用專業判斷並秉持專業懷疑態度。我亦會：\n- 識別和評估因欺詐或錯誤而導致財務報表存有重大錯誤陳述的風險；設計及執行審計程序以應對這些風險；以及取得充足和適當的審計憑證，作為我意見的基礎。由於欺詐可能涉及串謀、偽造、蓄意遺漏、虛假陳述，或凌駕內部控制的情況，因此未能發現因欺詐而導致重大錯誤陳述的風險，較未能發現因錯誤而導致者為高；\n- 了解與審計相關的內部控制，以設計適當的審計程序。然而，此舉並非旨在對集團內部控制的有效性發表意見；\n- 評價金融管理專員所採用的會計政策是否恰當，以及其作出的會計估計和相關資料披露是否合理；\n- 判定金融管理專員以持續經營作為會計基礎的做法是否恰當，並根據所得的審計憑證，判定是否存在與事件或情況有關，而且可能對集團持續經營的能力構成重大疑慮的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，則有必要在審計師報告中請使用者留意財務報表中的相關資料披露。假若所披露的相關資料不足，我便須發出非無保留意見的審計師報告。我的結論是基於截至審計師報告日止所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致集團不能繼續持續經營；\n- 評價財務報表的整體列報方式、結構和內容，包括披露資料，以及財務報表是否中肯反映交易和事項；及\n- 就集團中實體或業務活動的財務資料獲取充足和適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表發表意見。我負責指導、監督和執行集團審計。我對我的審計意見承擔全部責任。\n\n我會與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通計劃的審計範圍和時間以及重大審計發現等事項，包括我在審計期間識別出內部控制的任何重大缺陷。\n\n我亦會向外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會提交聲明，說明我已符合有關獨立性的相關道德要求，並與他們溝通所有被合理認為可能會影響我獨立性的關係和其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的防範措施。\n\n從與外匯基金諮詢委員會轄下的審核委員會溝通的事項中，我會決定哪些事項對本期財務報表的審計最為重要，因而構成關鍵審計事項。我會在審計師報告中描述這些事項，除非法律法規不允許對某件事項作出公開披露，或在極端罕見的情況下，因為有合理預期在我報告中溝通某事項而造成的負面後果將會超過其產生的公眾利益而我決定不應在報告中溝通該事項。\n\n審計署署長\n林智遠教授\n\n審計署\n香港\n金鐘道66號\n\n2023 年 4 月 11 日\n","en":"# Exchange Fund\n\nAuditor General's Report\nForeign Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Auditor General's Report\n\n# Report of the Independent Auditor to the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinions\n\nWe hereby certify that we have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiary companies (the \"Group\") listed on pages 179 to 281, which include the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2022, and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2022, together with the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of the principal accounting policies.\n\nI am of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and the Group as of December 31, 2022, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in compliance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Bill (Chapter 66).\n\n# The Foundation of Opinions\n\nI have conducted the audit in accordance with the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Bill and the auditing standards of the Audit Commission. My responsibilities, as determined by those standards, are detailed in the section of this report entitled \"Responsibilities of the Auditor for the Audit of the Financial Statements. In accordance with those standards, I am independent of the Group and have fulfilled other ethical responsibilities as required. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those that, according to my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements as of December 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in forming my opinion on the overall financial statements, and I will not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nPlease refer to financial statement notes 2.5, 2.6, and 38.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Group’s financial assets carried at fair value amounted to HKD 38,361.82 billion, and financial liabilities totaled HKD 12,074.98 billion.\n\n87% of these financial assets and all of these financial liabilities are valued at fair value, either based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), or estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2).\n\nThe fair value of the remaining 13% of these financial assets was estimated using valuation techniques, and the parameters used were not based on observable market data (Level 3 parameters). These financial assets totaled HKD 487.69 billion, primarily consisting of unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the significant amounts involved and the need for estimates, the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value is a key audit matter.\n\nAudit procedures for the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities recognized at fair value include:\n- Understanding the valuation procedures for different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, including related monitoring measures;\n- Evaluating and testing the effectiveness of monitoring measures, including those related to computer system applications;\n- Obtaining confirmations regarding the valuation, existence, rights and obligations, and completeness of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- Verifying prices against independent sources when using market quotations;\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the related assumptions, and verifying parameters against independent sources when the valuation method’s parameters are based on observable market data; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the related assumptions and parameters when the valuation method’s parameters are not based on observable market data.\n\n# Valuation of investment property measured at fair value\n\nPlease refer to financial statement notes 2.11, 18, and 19.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are accounted for at fair value, totaling HKD 233.94 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group also holds interests in four associate companies and twenty-two jointly controlled entities, whose principal business is the holding of overseas investment properties, with these interests valued at a total of HKD 396.31 billion. The fair values of these investment properties, whether held directly by the Group, or by associates or jointly controlled entities, are primarily determined based on valuations by independent professional appraisers. These valuations involve significant judgment and estimates, including the valuation methods and assumptions used.\n\nAudit procedures for investment properties accounted for at fair value include:\n- Obtaining and reviewing valuation reports for investment properties directly held by the Group or held by associates or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair value is determined based on the valuations stated in the relevant reports;\n- Assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuer; and\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the assumptions and parameters used.\n\n# Other materials\n\nFinancial management officers are responsible for other data. This data includes all information contained within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s 2022 Annual Report, excluding the financial statements and my auditor’s report.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not extend to other materials, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on those other materials.\n\nWith regard to the audit of the financial statements, I have a responsibility to read other documents and consider whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with the information I obtained during the audit, or appear to contain material misstatements. Based on the work I have performed, if I believe that other documents contain material misstatements, I am required to report that fact. In this regard, I have nothing to report.\n\n# The responsibilities of the Audit Committee under the Financial Management Officer and Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee in relation to financial statements.\n\nFinancial management professionals are responsible for preparing true and fair financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and the directions issued by the Chief Executive under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Bill, and for implementing internal controls as they deem necessary to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatements resulting from fraud or error.\n\nWhen preparing financial statements, financial management professionals are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern and, where applicable, disclosing matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# The responsibilities of an auditor in relation to the audit of financial statements.\n\nMy objective is to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the overall financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, and to issue an audit report including my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Auditing Standards will detect all material misstatements. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if they could individually or in aggregate influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.\n\nThroughout the audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards, I will apply professional judgment and maintain a professional skepticism. I will also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures to respond to those risks; and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence upon which to base my opinion. The risk of failing to detect a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of failing to detect a material misstatement resulting from error, because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or overriding of internal controls.\n- Understand internal controls relevant to the audit to design appropriate audit procedures. However, this is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted by management and the reasonableness of their accounting estimates and related disclosures.\n- Determine whether management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there are material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that material uncertainty exists, it is necessary to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements. If the disclosures are inadequate, I will issue a qualified audit report. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the auditor’s report date. However, future events or circumstances may cause the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements fairly present the transactions and matters.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for directing, supervising, and performing the Group audit. I bear full responsibility for my audit opinion.\n\nI will communicate with the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding the scope and timeline of the planned audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any material deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit.\n\nI will also submit a statement to the Audit Committee under the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, confirming that I have met all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicating to them any relationships or matters that could reasonably be considered to affect my independence, along with any relevant safeguards where applicable.\n\nBased on discussions with the Audit Committee under the Foreign Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I will determine which matters are most important to the audit of the current financial statements and therefore constitute key audit matters. I will describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless legal or regulatory requirements prohibit public disclosure of a matter, or in extremely rare circumstances, because there is a reasonable expectation that communicating a matter in my report would result in adverse consequences that would outweigh the public interest, and I decide not to communicate that matter in the report.\n\nAuditor General\nProfessor Lin Chih-yuan\n\nOffice of the Auditor General\nHong Kong\n66 Connaught Road Central\n\nApril 11, 2023\n"}
