{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nThe year 2021 was a year of concurrent consolidation and development.\n\nIn 2021, the pandemic entered its second year unabated: global supply chains were disrupted, inflation pressures were on the rise, risk of premature tightening of global financial conditions increased.  Adding to the unpredictability were the emergence of mutant variants of COVID-19 and the intensification of geopolitical tensions.  Despite such a macro environment filled with uncertainties, we continued to safeguard monetary and financial stability and maintain operational resilience.\n\n2021 also brought hope for recovery with the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with the accommodative monetary and fiscal policies introduced in multiple economies.  The global economy began to recover from the severe contraction in 2020.  Locally, after having endured economic contraction in 2019 and 2020, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, thanks to the rollout of the vaccination programme and the Government’s pandemic relief measures which have lent crucial support to our economic recovery.\n\nWith financial and monetary stability maintained, as well as a steadying macro environment, 2021 gave us some room to pursue more development work.  We seized the opportunity and pressed ahead with developmental initiatives that will help our financial sector remain highly competitive. Significant progress has been made across our three strategic priorities, namely fintech, green finance and Mainland market opportunities arising from Hong Kong’s gateway role.\n\nAs we entered 2022, the global environment took a turn for the worse.  But as the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  We will continue to be proactive and pursue our developmental goals and priorities to be better prepared for the next challenge and to cement our status as an international financial centre.  We will also remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure the soundness of Hong Kong monetary and financial systems, as we have risen to the many challenges time and again as in the past.\n\n# Monetary and financial stability: foundation of an international financial centre\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system and has helped Hong Kong withstand numerous shocks and challenges.  Despite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and market concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner throughout the year, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.\n\nThis confidence in our systems did not happen overnight, but is based on the solid foundation which has been built up over the years.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy, and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nThe confidence is also a result of our efforts in public and market engagement, as well as effective surveillance.  On the latter, we have leveraged technology and data analytics to strengthen our capability for more timely and comprehensive analysis on financial stability and macroprudential surveillance.\n\nThe robustness of the banking system is of paramount importance to financial stability in Hong Kong.  Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, our banks remained resilient with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  As at end-2021, the capital adequacy ratio of local banks stood at 20.2%, well above the minimum requirement of 8%, while the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of large banks was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  Despite a challenging credit landscape amid the pandemic, the asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year. The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.\n\n# Banking sector: a pillar of support to the economy\n\nAs always, the banking sector is an important pillar of support to economic activity.  This is ever more crucial in the face of economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the past year, a main challenge was to strike a balance between managing credit risk in the banking sector and maintaining the sector’s support for the real economy.  With our supervisory work over the years, banks continued to manage credit risks effectively.  At the same time, we worked closely with banks to provide the much needed relief to corporate and personal customers through the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme (PPPHS) and other relief measures.  The PPPHS, launched together with the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism in 2020 allowing eligible corporate customers to defer loan principal payments by six months on a pre-approval basis, was again further extended twice during 2021 until April 2022 recognising that some economic sectors were still hard-pressed by the lingering pandemic and were in need of continued credit relief.  Subsequently, in light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the PPPHS was further extended until the end of October 2022.  It is encouraging to see that the banking sector has joined forces with the HKMA to help relieve cash-flow pressures on corporate and individual borrowers, even whilst the sector itself is experiencing its own difficult operating conditions due to the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the challenging credit landscape, the pandemic also brought about a more difficult operating environment and a digital landscape with escalating cyber threat. We have stepped up our efforts to enhance operational and cyber resilience of the banking sector, as well as consumer and investor protection amid increasing digitalisation and a surge in phishing scams.  In particular, the Code of Banking Practice was revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nBesides supervisory work, we are dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and customer-centric culture in the banking sector.  Enhancing accessibility to banking services by customers in need has been one of our priority areas and we have been working closely with the industry to develop industry guidelines.  Further to the guidance on barrier-free banking services and provision of banking services for persons with intellectual disabilities, the industry, with the support of the HKMA, published in December 2021 a guideline to set out the principles and good practices for the banking industry in providing banking services to persons with dementia and customers in need.\n\nTo support the continued development of the banking sector in the future where the new growth opportunities and challenges require a new set of skills from the workforce, the HKMA has formulated a holistic talent development strategy — “Connecting Talent to the Future” — to groom future talent and upskill existing practitioners in a more systematic and targeted manner.  Our new strategy is built on three “connect” directions: connecting students to the banking industry, connecting practitioners to the future of banking, and connecting the key stakeholders together to enhance collaboration in implementing the strategy.  We have launched a series of outreach and promotional campaigns to attract more students to enter the banking industry. To better prepare university students to be “future ready”, we have launched the Future Banking Bridging Programme jointly with the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers, which comprises a series of courses that cover practical banking knowledge and useful soft skills that are highly in demand in the banking industry.  For the existing banking practitioners, we have been working closely with the industry on developing opportunities for upskilling through providing more in-demand training programmes.  In December 2021, the new Fintech module under the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners was launched.\n\nFinancial talent is crucial to the future development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  We will work hand in hand with all stakeholders with a view to strengthening the talent pool for the further development of the industry.\n\n# International financial centre: strong position underpinned by an unparalleled access to opportunities\n\nThe competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre is underpinned by the unparalleled access to opportunities it offers.  There is general consensus that global fintech adoption, opening-up of Mainland’s financial markets, and the mainstreaming of green and sustainable finance present huge opportunities for the future development of Hong Kong’s financial sector.  At the HKMA, we have dedicated substantial efforts in leveraging Hong Kong’s unique edge to capture these opportunities.  Let me talk about the fintech and Mainland opportunities first.\n\n# Comprehensive adoption of fintech\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the power of fintech and permanently changed customers’ behaviour towards financial services.  To make sure we continue to stay at the forefront of the global fintech scene and are ready to tap all of the potential of fintech, we must build an ecosystem where the value of fintech is experienced across all levels and by all groups of people.\n\nThis vision has driven us to formulate a new strategy, “Fintech 2025”, which was unveiled in June 2021.  As its name suggests, it aspires to help the financial sector adopt technology comprehensively by 2025.  The strategy comprises five focus areas which cover the required elements to achieve a successful ecosystem, and also the right factors for the ecosystem to grow further in a virtuous cycle. The first two parts of the strategy, namely “all banks go fintech” and “future-proofing Hong Kong for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)” mainly sought to create more demand for fintech adoption.  The other parts of the strategy relate to data, infrastructure, talent and funding, which are vital to the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nUnder this strategy, a number of new initiatives were introduced, such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) fintech pilot trial facility which allows financial institutions and technology firms to conduct pilot trials and obtain early feedback from regulators and users on their cross-boundary fintech initiatives, and the pilot launch of the Commercial Data Interchange which leverages the use of alternative data to facilitate SME financing.  We have also stepped up research on the application of wholesale CBDC to cross-border payments, and explored the prospect of e-HKD, which will increase Hong Kong’s readiness in terms of adopting CBDCs and in turn future-proof our city’s financial infrastructure in the decades ahead.\n\nWhile we capitalise on the new opportunities presented by technological advancement, we also continue to build on our existing achievements as well as watch out for new risks that may arise.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) introduced in 2018 has grown rapidly over the years, with the number of registrations reaching 9.6 million at the end of 2021, up 40% year on year.  The average daily turnover also increased 90% from 2020, reaching about 673,000 real-time transactions in 2021.  Meanwhile, in view of the rapid development of crypto-assets particularly payment-related stablecoins, we have issued a discussion paper earlier this year to invite market feedback on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nOur new, forward-thinking strategy will set the scene for a healthy growth of the fintech ecosystem.  As the banking sector increasingly adopts fintech to capture the opportunities it offers, this will ultimately benefit both financial institutions and Hong Kong people, while strengthening Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre.\n\n# Hong Kong as the dominant gateway to the Mainland\n\nHong Kong has always played a strategic role in linking the Mainland market with international financial markets, providing international investors with a familiar regime and platform to conduct various kinds of financial, investment and wealth management activities.  The National 14th Five-Year Plan strengthens Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre, a global offshore renminbi business hub, as well as asset management and risk management centres. This together with global economic trends has reinforced our conviction that Hong Kong should continue to enhance its unique value as a bridge connecting the Mainland and international markets.\n\nIn 2021, we reached a milestone in enhancing connectivity, adding two new members to our family of Connect schemes, namely the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the GBA, and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect, essentially completing the two-way loop of mutual access in a wide spectrum of financial markets including equities, debts and wealth management.  The launch of the two schemes will bring new opportunities for Hong Kong in various aspects. By meeting the increasing diversification needs of Mainland investors, the two schemes will enlarge the customer base of our bond market and wealth management industry.  I am pleased to see that these two schemes have been operating smoothly.  The HKMA will continue to engage the Mainland authorities to further enhance these schemes over time.\n","zh":"# 行政長官聲明\n\n二零二一年是鞏固與發展並進的一年。\n\n二零二一年，疫情進入第二年，未有減緩之勢：全球供應鏈受阻，通脹壓力上升，全球金融環境過早收緊的風險亦隨之增加。 此外，COVID-19 變異病毒株的出現以及地緣政治緊張局勢的加劇，更增加了不確定性。 儘管宏觀環境充滿變數，我們仍持續維護貨幣及金融穩定，並保持營運韌性。\n\n二零二一年也帶來了復甦的希望，伴隨著新冠疫苗的順利推行，以及多個經濟體實施的寬鬆貨幣和財政政策。全球經濟開始從二零二零年的嚴重收縮中復甦。本地方面，香港經濟在經歷了二零一九年和二零二零年的經濟收縮後，在二零二一年成長了百分之六點三， وذلك 歸功於疫苗接種計劃的推行以及政府的抗疫紓困措施，這些措施為我們的經濟復甦提供了關鍵支持。\n\n得益於穩健的財政與貨幣穩定，以及趨於平穩的宏觀環境，二零二一年為我們提供了推進更多發展工作的空間。我們把握機會，積極推動一系列發展倡議，以協助我們的金融業保持高度競爭力。在我們的三大戰略重點——金融科技、綠色金融以及香港作為橋樑所帶來的內地市場機遇方面，都取得了顯著進展。\n\n隨著新年的到來，二零二二年全球環境趨勢惡化。但正如諺語所說：「逆境出英雄」。我們將繼續積極主動，推動發展目標和優先事項，為應對下一個挑戰做好更充分的準備，並鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。我們亦將堅守初心，致力維護香港貨幣及金融系統的穩健，正如過去一次又一次地克服重重挑戰。\n\n# 貨幣與金融穩定：國際金融中心的基石\n\n自一九八三年創立以來，聯繫匯率制度一直是香港金融體系的堅實支柱，並有助香港歷經多次衝擊與挑戰。儘管新冠疫情的持續不確定性以及市場對美國貨幣政策收緊步伐的擔憂，全年香港法定金幣匯率及貨幣市場持續有序運作，反映了聯繫匯率制度的穩健性。\n\n我們對這些系統的信心並非一蹴可幾，而是建立在多年來穩固的基礎之上。國際貨幣基金組織在其2021年的外部部門報告中再次強調，一套透明的規則、充裕的財政和外匯儲備、健全的金融監管與監督、靈活的經濟體以及謹慎的財政框架，共同確保了LERS的可信度。\n\n這份信心也源於我們在公共領域和市場的積極參與，以及有效的監察。在後者方面，我們利用科技和數據分析，強化了對金融穩定及宏觀審慎監察進行更及時、更全面的分析能力。\n\n香港銀行體系的穩健性對金融穩定至關重要。疫情爆發兩年後，本地銀行依然保持韌性，流動性狀況及資本化水平均遠超國際標準。截至2021年底，本地銀行資本充足率為20.2%，遠高於法定最低要求8%，而大型銀行在2021年第四季的平均流動性覆蓋率為151.9%，同樣遠高於法定最低要求100%。儘管疫情期間信貸環境充滿挑戰，但銀行業的資產質素在該年內大致保持穩定。截至2021年底，該行業不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均水平1.8%。\n\n# 銀行業：經濟發展的支柱\n\n一如既往，銀行業是支持經濟活動的重要支柱。尤其在面對新冠疫情對經濟造成的影響時，這一點更顯重要。過去一年，主要挑戰在於如何在銀行業管理信貸風險的同時，維持該行業對實體經濟的支持。在我們多年的監管工作下，各銀行持續有效地管理信貸風險。 同時，我們亦與銀行密切合作，透過預先批准本金償還寬限計劃（PPPHS）及其他紓緩措施，為企業及個人客戶提供亟需的減輕措施。 預先批准本金償還寬限計劃，於2020年與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制一併推出，允許符合資格的企業客戶在預先批准的情況下，延遲六個月的貸款本金償還，並於2021年再次延期兩次，直至2022年4月，以表彰部分經濟行業仍然受到疫情持續影響，並需要持續的信貸寬限。 隨後，鑑於本地冠狀病毒感染病例再次出現，於2022年2月，預先批准本金償還寬限計劃進一步延期至2022年10月底。 令人鼓舞的是，銀行業與香港金融管理局攜手合作，有助於減輕企業及個人借款人的現金流壓力，即使該行業本身正因疫情爆發而經歷自身的艱難營運環境。\n\n除了充滿挑戰的信貸環境之外，疫情也帶來了更艱難的營運環境，以及日益嚴峻的網絡安全威脅。我們已加強努力，提升銀行業的營運及網絡韌性，並在數位化進程加速和網絡釣魚詐騙激增的同時，強化消費者和投資者保護。特別是，《銀行業行為守則》已進行修訂，以增強數位金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n除了監管工作外，我們亦致力推廣金融普惠及以客戶為中心的文化於銀行界。提升弱勢客戶接觸銀行服務的可達性一直是我們的重點範疇之一，我們與業界緊密合作，制定行業指引。 繼無障礙銀行服務及為智力障礙人士提供銀行服務的指引後，在香港金融管理局的支持下，業界於2021年12月發布了一項指引，旨在為銀行業向患有失智症人士及有需要的客戶提供銀行服務，訂定原則及良好範例。\n\n為支持未來銀行業持續發展，應對嶄新的增長機遇與挑戰，香港金融管理局已制定一項全面的人才發展策略——「連接人才，展望未來」，旨在更系統、更有針對性地培養未來人才，並提升現職從業者的技能。 我們的全新策略基於三大「連接」方向：連接學生與銀行業、連接從業員與銀行業的未來，以及連接各關鍵持份者，以加強策略實施的協作。 我們已推出一系列外展及宣傳活動，吸引更多學生投身銀行業。 為更好地為大學生做好「迎接未來」的準備，我們與香港銀行同業公會合辦「未來銀行過渡計劃」，該計劃包括一系列涵蓋實用銀行知識及銀行業高度需求之軟技能的課程。 針對現有的銀行從業員，我們一直與業界緊密合作，開發提升技能的機會，提供更多市場緊缺的培訓課程。 二零二一年十二月，在「加強銀行業從業員能力發展框架」下，全新金融科技模組正式推出。\n\n金融人才對香港作為國際金融中心未來的發展至關重要。我們將與各方利益相關者緊密合作，以強化業界的人才儲備，促進進一步發展。\n\n# 國際金融中心：堅實的地位得益於無與倫比的機會之門。\n\n香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，源於其提供無與倫比的發展機會。普遍認為，全球金融科技的普及、中國內地金融市場的開放以及綠色和可持續金融的興起，為香港金融業的未來發展帶來了巨大的機遇。香港金管局一直致力於利用香港獨有的優勢，把握這些機遇。現在，容我先談談金融科技和內地市場的機會。\n\n# 全面採用金融科技\n\n疫情已充分展現了金融科技的力量，並永久性地改變了消費者對金融服務的行為模式。為確保我們能持續保持在全球金融科技領域的領先地位，並準備好充分發揮金融科技的潛力，我們必須構建一個生態系統，讓金融科技的價值在各個層面和所有人群中都能得到體驗。\n\n這項願景推動我們制定了新的策略，「金融科技2025」，於2021年六月正式發布。顧名思義，其目標是協助金融界在2025年前全面擁抱科技。這項策略包含五個重點領域，涵蓋了構建成功生態系統所需的各個要素，以及推動生態系統進一步以正向循環發展的關鍵因素。策略的前兩個部分，即「全體銀行擁抱金融科技」和「為香港的央行數位貨幣（CBDC）做好準備」，主要旨在創造更多金融科技採用需求。策略的其他部分則與數據、基礎設施、人才和資金有關，這些都是生態系統發展至關重要的要素。\n\n根據此策略，推出了一系列新舉措，例如允許金融機構和科技公司進行跨境金融科技試點，並從監管機構和用戶那裡獲得早期回饋的粵港澳大灣區（GBA）金融科技試點設施，以及利用替代數據促進中小企業融資的商業數據交換試點啟動。我們同時加強了對央行數字貨幣（CBDC）批發模式在跨境支付中的應用的研究，並探討了電子港元（e-HKD）的前景，這將提升香港在採用央行數字貨幣方面的準備程度，並為我市的金融基礎設施在未來幾十年內做好儲備。\n\n在把握科技進步帶來的新機遇的同時，我們亦持續鞏固現有的成就，並留意可能出現的新風險。例如，於2018年推出的快速支付系統（FPS），多年來發展迅速，截至2021年底，註冊人數已達960萬，按年增長40%。平均每日成交額亦較2020年上升90%，2021年達到約673,000宗即時交易。 另一方面，鑒於加密資產，特別是與支付相關的穩定幣的快速發展，我們今年稍早發布了一份討論文件，以徵詢市場對制定適當監管框架的意見。\n\n我們全新的、具有前瞻性的策略，將為金融科技生態系統的健康發展奠定基礎。隨著銀行業越來越多地採用金融科技以把握其所提供的機遇，這最終將有益於金融機構及香港市民，並強化香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。\n\n# 香港作為進入中國內地的主要樞紐\n\n香港一向在連接內地市場與國際金融市場方面扮演著戰略性角色，為國際投資者提供熟悉的制度和平台，從事各種金融、投資及財富管理活動。國家十四五規劃進一步鞏固了香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及資產管理和風險管理中心的地位。 加上全球經濟的發展趨勢，這有助於我們堅信香港應繼續提升其作為連接內地與國際市場的獨特價值。\n\n二零二一年，我們在提升連接性方面 достигли значительного прогресса，新增了兩個「連繫」計劃成員，分別是 Greater Bay Area 跨境財富管理連繫計劃（跨境財富管理連繫計劃）及債券交易互聯互通計劃的南向交易，基本上完成了在廣泛的金融市場（包括股票、債務和財富管理）中雙向暢通的循環。 兩項計劃的推出將為香港帶來各方面的全新機遇。 藉著滿足中國內地投資者日益增長的多樣化需求，兩項計劃將擴大我哋債券市場及財富管理行業的客戶群。 我很高興看到這兩項計劃運作暢順。 香港金管局將繼續與內地主管部門合作，致力於日後進一步完善這些計劃。\n"}

{"en":"# Priorities for 2022 and Beyond\n\nGlobal and local conditions deteriorated notably entering 2022. On the one hand, the escalation of the Ukraine situation and expectations of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve triggered market volatility. On the other hand, the local economy took a hit from the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic. That said, Hong Kong’s financial system remains well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given its resilience and buffers built up over the years. Looking ahead, the HKMA will continue to attach high importance to safeguarding monetary and financial stability. In doing so, we will endeavour to stay ahead of the curve by identifying emerging risks and responding to them in an agile manner. At the same time, the HKMA will seek opportunities that would help bolster Hong Kong’s status as a leading international financial centre. In managing the Exchange Fund in this complicated investment environment, the HKMA will continue to invest prudently, while remaining flexible, implementing defensive measures as appropriate, and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.\n\n# STABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe global economic outlook remains subject to significant uncertainties.  The HKMA will keep abreast of latest developments and stay vigilant against potential risks, with the aim of upholding the resilience and stability of the financial system, which are essential for the ongoing provision of critical financial services that support the functioning of the Hong Kong economy.\n\n# Staying vigilant against potential risks\n\nLooking ahead, markets may be subject to heightened volatilities amid increased uncertainties on various fronts. On the one hand, the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy normalisation, if continuing at a fast pace, may tighten global financial conditions visibly ahead and increase the global debt-servicing burden.  On the other hand, following the escalation of the Ukraine situation in early 2022, geopolitical uncertainties including the China–US tension may continue to stay high and trigger bouts of financial market volatility again.  Last but not least, with the evolving pandemic developments, there might be a potential downside scenario where lockdowns were to be re-imposed at a large scale, leading to persistent global supply bottlenecks and adversely affecting global growth and inflation.  Having said that, Hong Kong’s financial system is well-positioned to withstand adverse shocks given the resilience and buffers built up over the years.  The HKMA also has the capability, resources and commitment to safeguard Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nThe HKMA will continue to closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities in the domestic and external environments and stand ready to deploy appropriate measures where necessary to maintain Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability. Research programmes in 2022 will study issues affecting the Hong Kong economy and assess their potential risks. Meanwhile, the HKMA’s ongoing Digitalisation Programme will help enhance its surveillance capabilities to support more holistic surveillance and comprehensive analysis of the financial system.\n\n# Maintaining banking stability\n\nAs developed markets tighten monetary policies and the impact of the pandemic lingers, the credit landscape facing the banking sector is expected to remain challenging. At the same time, rapid technological advancement and digitalisation present both opportunities and challenges to the banking sector.  Facing an ever-changing financial landscape, the HKMA strives to ensure banks’ ability to withstand shocks through its ongoing supervisory efforts. At the same time, the HKMA will also continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# A risk-based supervisory focus\n\n# Credit risk\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will step up the surveillance of banks’ credit risk exposures and take proactive steps to ensure that overall risk levels remain well contained.\n\nThe HKMA will also continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and its effect on the operating conditions of corporates, as well as maintain close dialogue with the banking and commercial sectors while keeping the various relief measures under review.\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nWith the issuance of the new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience” in May 2022, the HKMA will continue to engage the industry and understand authorized institutions’ (AIs’) progress in developing their operational resilience frameworks.  In parallel, the HKMA will seek to raise the banking sector’s cyber resilience by following up with AIs on issues revealed by the assessments under the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and monitoring AIs’ implementation of secure tertiary data backup.  Another key supervisory focus will be evaluating and addressing the risks from AIs’ growing dependency on technology service providers.\n\nWith enhanced digital capabilities and extensive remote working experience accumulated during the pandemic, some AIs are planning to transition to a hybrid working model on a business-as-usual basis.  The HKMA will keep track of this development and assess whether the associated risks are adequately addressed by the industry.\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nThe HKMA will focus on the supervision of AIs’ liquidity and market risk management in 2022.  In particular, the HKMA will continue to monitor AIs’ progress in transitioning away from the remaining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings before these settings cease to be published by 30 June 2023.\n\n# Combating money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA’s work on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) will continue to focus on strengthening response to fraud and financial crime through collaboration and information sharing, pursuing closer co-operation with various stakeholders in the AML\/CFT ecosystem.  Other priorities are to implement a wider range of risk-sensitive supervisory techniques, by leveraging enhanced data and supervisory technology (Suptech) capabilities, and promote the use of Regtech by banks, including transaction monitoring systems.\n\nThe HKMA will also keep working closely with the Government, the banking and stored value facility (SVF) sectors to publish an updated Hong Kong money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and assist the industry in combatting new and emerging risks.  Work will also continue on understanding evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risks, implementing changes to AML law and related guidance to align with international standards, and maintaining proactive engagement with other regulators and international standard setters.\n\n# Wealth management and mandatory provident fund-related businesses\n\nIn 2022, the HKMA will carry out on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of AIs’ conduct in relation to wealth management and the selling of securities, mandatory provident fund (MPF) and other investment and insurance products, with a focus on the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Cross-boundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, digital advisory platforms, complex products, virtual assets and non-investment-linked long term insurance products.\n\nWhile maintaining close communication with other regulators and the banking industry, the HKMA will provide further guidance on regulatory standards in relation to the sale of investment, insurance and MPF products.  This will cover, among other things, investment services related to virtual assets and the selling of Protection Linked Plans, a new subset of investment-linked assurance scheme products with high level of insurance protection.  The HKMA, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority will jointly launch a mystery shopping programme on the selling practices of intermediaries in respect of Qualifying Deferred Annuity Policies and Tax-deductible Voluntary Contributions.\n\nFollowing the smooth launch of the Cross-boundary WMC, the HKMA will continue engaging the industry and relevant regulatory authorities to enhance the scheme.\n\nMoreover, the HKMA will embark on preparation work for supervising AIs’ trust business under a new SPM module and a new Code of Practice.\n\n# Oversight of financial market infrastructures\n\nThe HKMA will continue to promote the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructures (FMIs) under its oversight, in accordance with the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO), the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)1, and the various guidances issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).  It will fine-tune the FMI oversight framework taking into account the latest technological and market developments.\n\nThe HKMA will work with the FMIs on their observance of the PFMI, conducting and updating assessments as appropriate. In addition, the HKMA will continue to participate in the CPMI-IOSCO PFMI implementation monitoring and assessment exercise.  The HKMA will also participate in the work of international standard setting bodies and strengthen its oversight requirements in response to market and technology developments and in line with international practices.  The HKMA will work with relevant authorities to further strengthen co-operative oversight arrangements where appropriate.\n\n# Policy development\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance and refine its banking supervisory and regulatory frameworks and policies, taking into account international standards and best practices.\n\n# Implementation of Basel standards in Hong Kong\n\n# Capital standards\n\nThe HKMA will continue to enhance the capital framework with the implementation of the standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in recent years, which include the following:\n\nThe Capital Requirements for Banks’ Equity Investments in Funds of December 2013 (EIF standard), which will come into effect on 1 July 2022 with the Banking (Capital) (Amendment) Rules 2022 commencing operation after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe revised capital standards set out in the Basel III Finalising Post-crisis Reforms of December 2017, the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk of January 2019 (revised in February 2019), and the Targeted Revisions to the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Framework of July 2020, which are collectively referred to as the “Basel III final reform package”.  These revised capital standards set out the revised capital treatment of credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and operational risk, introduce an output floor requirement, and enhance the leverage ratio framework.  Amendments to the Banking (Capital) Rules (BCR) are being prepared in consultation with the industry with a view to them taking effect from 1 July 2023 as minimum requirements (except for those on market risk and CVA risk2).\n\nGiven that the capital treatment for sovereign concentration risk under the BCR was designed to complement the Basel Committee’s large exposure framework as implemented by the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the HKMA will propose amendments to the capital rules in parallel with relevant changes to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules.\n\n# Exposure limits\n\nThe HKMA will continue its work on the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules in consultation with the industry and the Department of Justice with a target implementation date aligned with the one for the Basel III final reform package, i.e. 1 July 2023.\n\n# Disclosure standards\n\nNew or revised disclosure requirements associated with the revised capital standards in the Basel III final reform package are mainly set out in the Pillar 33 Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework and the Revisions to Market Risk Disclosure Requirements, published by the Basel Committee in December 2018 and November 2021 respectively.  The Basel Committee also published the Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements in June 2019 amending the disclosure requirements for leverage ratio to address concerns regarding potential “window-dressing” (i.e. banks reducing the volumes of certain transactions around reporting dates to artificially inflate their leverage ratios for reporting and public disclosure).  Corresponding amendments to the Banking (Disclosure) Rules to implement these new or revised disclosure requirements are also being prepared, with a view to having them take effect in Hong Kong along the same timelines as their associated revised capital standards.\n\n# Other supervisory policies and risk management guidelines\n\nTo reflect developments in regulatory requirements and international standards, the HKMA plans to update certain SPM modules, including those relevant to the implementation of the revised capital and disclosure standards in the Basel III final reform package, “Countercyclical Capital Buffer – Approach to its Implementation”, “Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”, “New Share Subscription and Share Margin Financing” and “Stress Testing”.  The HKMA will also continue to work on the revised SPM modules on “Code of Conduct” and “Reporting Requirements Relating to Authorized Institutions’ External Auditors under the Banking Ordinance”, with an aim to finalising the revisions within 2022. Consequential to the proposed amendments to the Banking (Exposure Limits) Rules, the related Code of Practice and SPM modules, e.g. CR-G-8 on “Large Exposures and Risk Concentrations” and CR-G-9 on “Exposures to Connected Parties”, will be updated accordingly.\n","zh":"# 2022年及以後的優先事項\n\n進入2022年，全球及本地情況顯著惡化。一方面，烏克蘭局勢升級以及美國聯儲局加息預期，引發市場波動。另一方面，本地經濟受到新一波新冠疫情的影響。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉其韌性及多年來累計的緩衝，仍然處於有利地位，足以應對不利衝擊。展望未來，香港金管局將繼續高度重視維護貨幣及金融穩定。為達此目的，我們將努力保持領先一步，識別新興風險並以靈活的方式應對。與此同時，香港金管局亦將尋找機會，鞏固香港作為國際金融中心首要地位。在管理投資基金於此複雜的投資環境下，香港金管局將繼續謹慎投資，並保持靈活性，適時採取防禦措施，並維持高度的流動性。\n\n# 金融體系的穩定性與健全性\n\n全球經濟前景仍然存在不少不確定因素。香港金管局將密切關注最新發展，並時刻警惕潛在風險，以維護金融體系的穩健及穩定，而這對於持續提供支持香港經濟運作的關鍵金融服務至關重要。\n\n# 保持對潛在風險的警惕\n\n展望未來，市場可能面臨較高波動，原因是各方面的不確定性增加。一方面，如果美國聯邦儲備局的貨幣政策正常化持續快速進行，可能會在預期之上收緊全球金融環境，並增加全球債務償付負擔。另一方面，自2022年初烏克蘭局勢升級以來，包括中美關係緊張在內的地緣政治不確定性可能持續居高不下，並可能再次引發金融市場的波動。最後，隨著疫情發展變化，存在潛在的下行情境，即大規模重新實施封鎖，導致全球供應鏈持續受阻，並對全球經濟增長和通脹產生不利影響。儘管如此，香港的金融體系憑藉多年來積累的韌性和緩衝，具備承受不利衝擊的能力。香港金管局亦具備維護香港貨幣及金融穩定所需的實力、資源和承諾。\n\n金管局將繼續密切監察本地及外部環境中的風險及漏洞，並在必要時隨時部署適當措施，以維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。 2022年的研究計劃將探討影響香港經濟的問題，並評估其潛在風險。 另一方面，金管局持續進行的數碼化進程將有助提升其監察能力，以支持更全面的監察及對金融體系的全面分析。\n\n# 維護金融穩定\n\n隨著先進經濟體收緊貨幣政策，以及疫情影響持續存在，預期銀行業面臨的信貸環境將持續充滿挑戰。 同時，快速的科技進步和數位化為銀行業帶來了機遇，也帶來了挑戰。 面對瞬息萬變的金融環境，香港金管局致力於透過持續的監管工作，確保銀行應對衝擊的能力。 同時，金管局亦將繼續提升和完善其銀行監管和規管框架及政策，並參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 風險為本的監管重點\n\n# 信用風險\n\n二零二二年，香港金管局將加強對銀行信貸風險的監察，並採取主動措施，確保整體風險水平保持在可控範圍內。\n\n金管局將繼續監察疫情的發展及其對企業營商環境的影響，並將與銀行及商業界保持密切溝通，同時檢討各項紓緩措施。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n自二零二二年五月發布《監察指引手册》(SPM)「營運穩健」新模組以來，香港金融管理局將繼續與業界溝通，並了解持牌金融機構（AIs）在發展營運穩健框架方面的進展。與此同時，香港金融管理局亦將致力提升銀行業的網絡安全穩健程度，跟進根據《網絡安全穩健評估框架2.0》評估中揭示的問題，並監察持牌金融機構實施安全級別備份數據的情況。另一個重要的監察重點將是評估及應對持牌金融機構日益依賴技術服務供應商所帶來的風險。\n\n憑藉著強化了的數位能力，以及在疫情期間累積的豐富遠端工作經驗，部分人工智能系統正計劃在常態化的營運模式下轉向混合工作模式。香港金融管理局將會持續關注此發展，並評估業界是否已充分應對相關風險。\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n金管局將於二零二二年專注於監察人工智能（AI）的流動資金及市場風險管理。 尤其，金管局將繼續監察人工智能（AI）在逐步淘汰剩餘倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）的進展，以應對這些數據於二零二三年六月三十日停止發布。\n\n# 打擊洗錢和恐怖主義融資\n\n二零二二年，香港金管局在打擊洗錢及 терроризм融資（AML\/CFT）的工作將繼續重點關注加強對欺詐及金融犯罪的回應，透過合作和信息分享，並與反洗錢及 терроризм融資生態系統中的各方利益相關者加強合作。其他優先事項包括利用增強數據及監管科技（Suptech）能力，實施更廣泛的風險敏感監察技術，以及推廣銀行使用監管科技，包括交易監察系統。\n\n金管局將繼續與政府、銀行及Stored Value Facility（SVF）業界緊密合作，發布更新後的香港洗錢及恐怖融資風險評估報告，並協助業界應對新興風險。同時，將繼續研究不斷演變的洗錢及恐怖融資風險，實施修訂《洗錢及反恐融資條例》及相關指引，以符合國際標準，並與其他監管機構及國際標準制定機構保持積極聯繫。\n\n# 財富管理及強制性公積金相關業務\n\n二零二二年，香港金管局將會對人工智能（AI）在提供資產管理服務、銷售證券、強制性公積金（MPF）及其他投資及保險產品方面的行為進行現場審查及離線監察，重點關注粵港澳大灣區兩地通資產管理互聯互通計劃（兩地通WMC），數碼投顧平台、複雜產品、虛擬資產以及非投資相連長期保險產品。\n\n金管局將在與其他監管機構及銀行業界保持密切溝通的同時，就投資、保險及強積金產品的銷售，進一步提供監管標準指引。此指引將涵蓋多個方面，包括與虛擬資產相關的投資服務以及銷售「保障計劃連結保險計劃」，這是一類具有高水平保險保障的投資相連保險計劃的新範疇。金管局、保險監理處及強制性公積金計劃管理局將聯手推出一項「神秘顧客」計劃，以檢視中介人銷售「符合資格遞延年金保險計劃」及「可減稅自願供款」的銷售手法。\n\n跨境 WMC 順利推出後，香港金管局將繼續與業界及相關監管機構合作，以提升此計劃。\n\n此外，金管局將會展開為監督人工智能的信託業務而備妥工作，將採用新的SPM模組及新的行為守則。\n\n# 金融市場基礎設施的監督\n\n金管局將繼續推廣其監管下金融市場基礎設施（FMI）的安全及效率，並將依據《支付系統及預付卡發牌條例》，金融市場基礎設施原則（PFMI）¹，以及支付及結算基礎設施委員會（CPMI）發布的各項指引來執行。金管局亦將根據最新的科技發展及市場變化，調整金融市場基礎設施監管框架。\n\n金管局將與支付系統重要參與者合作，確保其遵守《支付系統風險管理原則》，並適時進行評估及更新。此外，金管局將繼續參與國際支付系統委員會（CPMI）及國際證券監督組織（IOSCO）聯合發起的《支付系統風險管理原則》執行情況監察及評估工作。金管局亦將參與國際標準制定機構的工作，並根據市場及科技發展以及國際慣例，加強其監察要求。金管局將與相關監管機構合作，適時加強合作監察安排。\n\n# 政策制定\n\n香港金管局將繼續完善及調整其銀行監察及監管框架和政策，並將參考國際標準及最佳實務。\n\n# 香港巴塞爾標準的實施\n\n# 資本標準\n\n香港金管局將繼續加強資本框架，並將落實近來巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（巴塞爾委員會）發布的標準，其中包括：\n\n銀行對基金股本投資的資本要求（二零一三年十二月（EIF 標準）），將於二零二二年七月一日，經立法會審議通過後，配合《銀行（資本）（（修訂））規例》二零二二年生效。\n\n二零一七年十二月制定的《巴塞爾三框架危機後改革最終版》中的已修訂資本標準、一九年一月發布的《市場風險最低資本要求》（一九年二月修訂）、以及二零年七月發布的《針對信用估值調整風險框架的定向修訂》，統稱為「巴塞爾三最終改革方案」。 這些已修訂的資本標準規範了信用風險、市場風險、信用估值調整（CVA）風險和操作風險的已修訂資本處理方式，引入了最低產出基準要求，並加強了杠杆率框架。 針對《銀行（資本）規則》（BCR）的修正案正在與業界協商擬定，預計將於二零二三年七月一日生效作為最低要求（市場風險和CVA風險除外）。\n\n鑒於在BCR框架下，針對主權集中風險的資本處理方式旨在補充香港銀行業（風險限額）規則所實行的巴塞爾委員會大型風險框架，香港金融管理局將於銀行業（風險限額）規則相關變動同時，建議修訂資本規章。\n\n# 暴露限值\n\n金管局將繼續就《銀行（風險限額）規則》的建議修改草案，與業界及司法署商討，目標是在與巴塞爾三框架最終改革方案一致的日期，即2023年7月1日生效實施。\n\n# 披露標準\n\n關於巴塞爾III最終改革方案所修訂的資本標準相關的新或修訂的披露要求，主要載於巴塞爾委員會於2018年12月及2021年11月分別發布的《披露要求第三 Pillar – 更新框架》及《市場風險披露要求修訂》。巴塞爾委員會亦於2019年6月發布《杠桿比率披露要求修訂》，修訂了杠桿比率的披露要求，以應對銀行在報告日期前後減少特定交易量以虛增其杠桿比率，從而進行「粉飾」的潛在問題。為實施這些新或修訂的披露要求，相關的銀行（披露）規則修訂亦正籌備中，目標是使之在香港生效的時間與其相關修訂的資本標準一致。\n\n# 其他監管政策及風險管理指引\n\n為反映監管要求及國際標準的發展，金管局計劃更新若干自律公佈編制 (SPM) 模組，包括與《巴塞爾三框架最終改革方案》中已修訂資本及披露標準的實施相關的模組，例如「逆周期資本緩衝 – 實施方法」、「銀行帳簿內利率風險」、「新股認購及股票資產融資」及「壓力測試」。金管局亦將繼續就「行為守則」及「《銀行條例》下獲授權金融機構外部審計師的報告要求」等已修訂的自律公佈編制 (SPM) 模組進行研究，目標於2022年完成修訂。 鑑於建議修改《銀行（風險限額）規則》，相關行為守則及自律公佈編制 (SPM) 模組，例如「大額風險及風險集中度」（CR-G-8）及「關聯方風險」（CR-G-9），將相應更新。\n"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nWith strong merchandise exports, reviving domestic demand and a boost from the Government’s supportive policy measures, the Hong Kong economy resumed positive growth in 2021, reversing the contraction experienced during 2019 and 2020. The labour market also improved, and inflation remained moderate albeit having edged up. While economic recovery is expected to continue after the fifth wave of COVID-19 subsides, its strength and speed are subject to uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nDriven by strong merchandise exports and improving domestic demand, the Hong Kong economy grew by 6.3% in 2021, ending the economic contraction in 2019 and 2020 (Table 1 and Chart 1).  Private consumption recovered, thanks to improved labour market conditions and a boost from the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme1. Overall investment spending also rebounded as the business environment and outlook improved2.  Externally, HongKong’s exports of goods saw strong growth for the whole year, in part supported by the continued global economic recovery.  Export of services recorded modest growth, reflecting active regional trade and cargo flows as well as stronger cross-border business and financial activities. Total imports rose appreciably, mainly because of greater domestic and re-export-induced demand.  On a net basis, external trade contributed positively to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 (Chart 1) as total exports grew faster than imports.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available. Source: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures edged up but remained moderate during the year.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the year-on-year underlying inflation rate3 picked up gradually to a mild 1.4% in December (Chart 2)4.  Prices of consumer items such as dining out, transport, clothing and footwear regained upward momentum as local consumption demand improved. Import prices also increased notably alongside bottlenecks in global supply chains and the surge in international energy and commodity prices.  By contrast, the housing component was a drag on overall inflation, reflecting the feed-through of the earlier decline in fresh-letting private residential rentals (Chart 2).  More broadly, slow growth in nominal wage and commercial rentals helped keep domestic business cost pressures in check.  For 2021 as a whole, the underlying and headline inflation rates5 stayed mild at 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nChart 2 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Labour market\n\nAlongside the domestic economic recovery, the labour market improved in 2021.  After reaching a 17-year high of 7.2% in February, the unemployment rate declined visibly to 4.0% in December6 (Chart 3) and the decline was broad based across most economic sectors.  Overall labour demand strengthened gradually as reflected by a pick-up in total employment (Chart 3) and private sector vacancies, though they were still below their pre-pandemic peaks.  On the other hand, the labour force shrank slightly by 1.3% in December compared with a year earlier, partly due to a modest decline in the labour force participation rate. The year-on-year growth in nominal wage and labour earnings, while moderate, showed signs of acceleration in the first three quarters of 2021, reversing the trend of deceleration during 2019–2020.\n\nChart 3 Labour market conditions\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe local stock market was broadly sluggish during the year, despite a continued rally in some major overseas equity markets (Chart 4).  Extending its rebound in late 2020, the Hang Seng Index rose to a high of 31,085 on 17 February 2021, but market sentiment had turned sharply negative since then owing to a host of factors, including concerns about the new COVID-19 virus variants, potential monetary policy tightening by major central banks and reduced inflows from southbound trading under Stock Connect7.  The Hang Seng Index closed the year at 23,398, down markedly by 14.1% from a year ago.\n\nChart 4 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market regained some upward momentum in the first half of 2021 alongside better economic prospects, but saw some consolidation in the second half amid weakened asset market sentiments (Chart 4).  Overall, housing prices and transaction volume still recorded an increase of 3.7% and 24.1% respectively in 2021. Household affordability also became even more stretched, partly reflecting reduced household income.  On the other hand, after going through sharp corrections in 2019 and 2020, the non-residential property markets generally improved, with prices and rentals of industrial properties generally rising to their pre-pandemic peaks, whereas those of retail and office spaces remained below their respective peaks.\n\nSee Table B: Major Economic Indicators on pages 326 to 327 for more details, including their trends during 2017–2021.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nIn early 2022, the fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on domestic economic activities. In response, the Government introduced the fifth and the sixth rounds of the Anti-epidemic Fund and additional countercyclical measures under the 2022–23 Budget to help support the economy.  The HKMA, together with the banking sector, also extended the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme to the end of October 2022.\n\nFor 2022 as a whole, economic recovery is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to 2021, partly reflecting the impact of the fifth wave of COVID-19, slower global economic growth, a less favourable base effect and US monetary policy normalisation.  The Government forecasts real GDP growth for 2022 to be in the range of 1–2% and the latest growth estimates by international organisations and private sector analysts averaged 1.1%.  That said, the strength and pace of the recovery are subject to a host of uncertainties and risks, especially those surrounding the pandemic, the Ukraine situation, and the path of US monetary policy normalisation.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nAlongside rising import prices and pandemic-induced logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures are expected to edge up in the near term, but should stay broadly in check owing to soft rentals and mild local labour cost pressures. Market consensus forecasts a headline inflation rate of 2.4% in 2022, while the Government projects the headline and underlying inflation rates to be 2.1% and 2.0% respectively. The fifth wave of local COVID-19 infections has exerted pressures on the labour market in early 2022, especially for contact-intensive sectors.  Further out, labour market conditions will depend on the pandemic developments and the pace of the domestic economic recovery.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be stable in 2021.  Total banking assets expanded moderately as both loans and deposits increased.  The capital and liquidity positions of the banking sector remained robust. Asset quality stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nThe banking sector’s balance sheet grew by 1.9% in 2021. Driven by the economic recovery, total loans recorded a growth of 3.8% during the year, compared with 1.2% in 2020.  Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong grew by 4.4%, loans for use outside Hong Kong grew by 1.1% and trade finance increased by 14.2%.  Mainland-related lending expanded by 3.6% in 2021, after remaining largely stable in 2020.\n\nOn the liability side, total deposits rose by 4.6% in 2021, compared with 5.4% in 2020.  As total deposits increased at a faster pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio edged down to 71.8% at the end of 2021 from 72.3% a year ago (Chart 5).\n\nChart 5 Loans and deposits of the banking sector\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Capital adequacy\n\nThe banking sector remained well capitalised. The consolidated total capital ratio of locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) stood at 20.2% at the end of 2021.  The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.2% (Chart 6). Both ratios were well above their respective international minimum requirements of 8% and 6%.\n\nThe Basel III leverage ratio was 7.9% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 3% (Chart 7).\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe liquidity position of the banking sector was sound.  The quarterly average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of category 1 institutions8 was 151.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well\n\nabove the statutory minimum requirement of 100%. The quarterly average Liquidity Maintenance Ratio (LMR) of category 2 institutions was 59.1%, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 25% (Chart 8).\n\nChart 8 Liquidity ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\nThe sources of funding of the banking sector remained stable.  The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of category 1 institutions was 135.3% at the end of 2021, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 100%.  The Core Funding\n\nRatio (CFR) of category 2A institutions9 was 150.3% at the end of 2021, also well above the statutory minimum requirement of 75% (Chart 9).\n\nChart 9 Funding ratios of designated AIs\nSource: HKMA.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nAsset quality remained stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards. The classified loan ratio was 0.88% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.90% at the end of 2020, with the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio edging down to 0.56% from 0.57% during the period (Chart 10).  The classified loan ratio for Mainland-related lending was 0.86% at the end of 2021 as compared to 0.96% at the end of 2020.  The delinquency ratios of residential mortgage lending and credit card lending remained low at 0.04% and 0.20% respectively (Chart 11). The HKMA will continue to closely monitor the change in the asset quality of the banking sector.\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe low interest rate environment continued to weigh on the profitability of the banking sector.  The aggregate pre-tax operating profit of retail banks declined by 19.8% in 2021 (Chart 12), mainly attributable to a decrease in net interest income (-13.6%) and an increase in total operating expenses (+7.1%).  These were partly offset by an increase in income from fees and commissions (+9.6%) and a drop in loan impairment charges (-25.1%).  The net interest margin further narrowed to 0.98% in 2021 from 1.18% in 2020 (Chart 13).\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio rose to 54.7% in 2021 from 47.0% in 2020 (Chart 14).\n","zh":"# 經濟與金融環境\n\n得益於強勁的商品出口、復甦的本地需求以及政府支持性政策的推動，香港經濟在2021年恢復正向增長，扭轉了2019年和2020年經歷的收縮。勞工市場也得到改善，通脹維持溫和，儘管有所上升。預期疫情第五波過後經濟復甦將持續，但其力度和速度仍受不確定因素和風險影響，尤其涉及疫情發展以及美國貨幣政策正常化的進程。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 真實活動\n\n得益於強勁的商品出口和改善的本地需求，香港經濟在2021年增長6.3%，結束了2019年和2020年的經濟收縮（見表1及圖1）。 私人消費支出隨著勞工市場狀況改善以及政府消費券計劃的推動而有所回升。 總體投資支出也隨著營商環境和前景的改善而反彈。 外部方面，香港的商品出口全年錄得強勁增長，部分原因是全球經濟持續復甦。 服務出口錄得溫和增長，反映了活躍的區域貿易和貨物流量，以及更強勁的跨境商業和金融活動。 總進口顯著上升，主要原因是本地需求和轉口貿易帶動的需求增加。 淨外部貿易對2021年的實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長貢獻了正向影響（見圖1），因為總出口增長速度快於進口。\n\n表一 實質 GDP 增長（按支出構成劃分）（期對期）\n\n由於沒有季節性調整後的國內固定資本形成量按季變動率數據。 資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通貨膨脹壓力有所上升，但全年仍屬溫和。剔除政府一次性紓緩措施的影響後，經調整後的按年通脹率3，於十二月溫和上升至1.4%（圖表2）4。外出用餐、交通、服裝及鞋履等消費品價格，隨著本地消費需求改善而回升。進口價格亦因應全球供應鏈瓶詰及國際能源及商品價格飆升而顯著上升。相反，房屋成份則對整體通脹構成拖累，反映了先前私人租屋市場租金下跌的影響（圖表2）。更廣泛地說，名義工資及商業租金的增長放緩有助於控制本地企業成本壓力。2021年全年，經調整後的通脹率及總體通脹率5分別維持在溫和水平，為0.6%及1.6%。\n\n圖表 2 隱藏的消費者物價膨脹\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n隨著國內經濟復甦，勞工市場在2021年有所改善。失業率在二月份達到近17年來的高點7.2%後，於十二月明顯下降至4.0%（圖3），且此下降趨勢廣泛地覆蓋了大多數經濟部門。總體勞動力需求逐漸增強，正如總就業人數的上升（圖3）以及民間部門空缺職位的增加所反映的一樣，儘管它們仍低於疫情前的峰值。另一方面，與一年前相比，勞動力規模在十二月縮小了1.3%，部分原因是勞動力參與率略有下降。名義工資和勞工收入的年增長率，雖然溫和，但在2021年首三季呈現加速跡象，扭轉了2019年至2020年間的減速趨勢。\n\n圖3 勞工市場狀況\n資料來源：香港政府統計處。\n\n# 股市\n\n儘管部分主要海外股市持續上漲（見圖4），但本地股市在當年表現普遍低迷。香港恆生指數延續了2020年末的反彈，於2021年2月17日上漲至31,085點的歷史高位，但自那以後市場情緒急轉直下，原因在於多項因素，包括對新型COVID-19病毒變種的擔憂、主要央行潛在的貨幣政策收緊以及透過滬港通南向交易減少的資金流入。截至當年年底，恆生指數收報23,398點，較一年前大幅下跌14.1%。\n\n圖四 資產價格\n資料來源：地政總署及香港交易所及結算所。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n2021年上半年，受益於經濟前景的改善，住宅物業市場恢復了一定的上漲勢頭，但下半年則因資產市場情緒疲弱而出現了一定程度的盤整（見圖4）。總體而言，2021年住宅價格和成交量分別錄得3.7%和24.1%的增長。家庭負擔能力也進一步惡化，部分原因是家庭收入減少。另一方面，經過2019年和2020年的大幅調整後，非住宅物業市場普遍有所改善，工業物業的價格和租金普遍回升至疫情前的峰值，而零售和辦公室空間的價格則仍低於各自的峰值。\n\n請參閱第326至327頁的B表：主要經濟指標，以了解更多詳情，包括2017年至2021年的趨勢。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n二零二二年年初，本地第五波新冠疫情對本地經濟活動造成壓力。 應對此情況，政府已推出第五輪及第六輪防疫抗疫基金，並於二零二二至二三年度財政預算中實施額外的逆周期措施，以支持經濟。 香港金管局與銀行界同時將先批准本金還款假期計劃延至二零二二年十月尾。\n\n2022年全年，經濟復甦預計將持續，但相較於2021年，增長速度將會較為溫和，部分原因反映了第五波疫情的影響、全球經濟增長放緩、基數效應轉差以及美國貨幣政策正常化。政府預測2022年實際GDP增長率將落在1%至2%之間，而國際機構和私營部門分析師的最新增長估計平均為1.1%。然而，復甦的力度和速度仍面臨諸多不確定性和風險，尤其是在疫情、烏克蘭局勢以及美國貨幣政策正常化的進程方面。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n隨著進口價格上漲及疫情引發的物流中斷，預計短期內通脹壓力將會上升，但由於租金疲軟及本地勞工成本壓力溫和，整體而言應能控制得宜。市場普遍預期2022年的整體通脹率為2.4%，而政府則預測整體及核心通脹率分別為2.1%及2.0%。今年初，本地第五波新冠疫情對勞動市場造成壓力，尤其是在接觸密集行業。展望未來，勞動市場狀況將取決於疫情發展以及本地經濟復甦的進程。\n\n# 銀行業表現\n\n二零二一年，香港銀行業持續保持穩定。銀行總資產溫和擴張，貸款及存款均有所增加。銀行業的資本及流動性狀況仍然穩健。資產質素在歷史及國際標準下均維持健康水平。\n\n# 資產負債表趨勢\n\n二零二一年，銀行業資產負債表增長1.9%。 經濟復甦的推動下，全年貸款總額錄得3.8%的增長，較二零二零年的1.2%為高。 其中，香港本地貸款增長4.4%，香港以外地區貸款增長1.1%，而貿易融資則上升14.2%。 內地相關貸款於二零二一年擴展3.6%，此前於二零二零年大致保持穩定。\n\n在負債方面，截至2021年底，存款總額較2020年增長4.6%，而2020年增長為5.4%。由於存款總額增長速度快於貸款總額，整體貸款與存款比率略微下降至71.8%，較去年底的72.3%有所降低（見圖5）。\n\n圖5 銀行業貸款及存款\n資料來源：香港金管局\n\n# 資本充足率\n\n銀行業的資本化狀況維持良好。截至2021年底，本地註冊認可金融機構（AI）的合併總資本充足率為20.2%。第一級資本充足率為18.2%（見圖6）。這兩個比率均遠高於其各自的國際最低要求，分別為8%和6%。\n\n2021年底，巴塞爾III 槓桿比率為7.9%，遠高於法定最低要求3%（見圖7）。\n\n# 流動性\n\n銀行業的流動性狀況良好。 2021年第四季，第一類金融機構的季平均流動性覆蓋率（LCR）為151.9%，遠高於…\n\n高於法定最低要求百分之百。第二類金融機構的季平均流動性維持率（LMR）為百分之五十九點一，同樣遠高於法定最低要求百分之二十五（見圖8）。\n\n圖表 8 指定人工智能的流動性比率\n來源：香港金管局\n\n銀行業的資金來源維持穩定。截至2021年底，第一類金融機構的淨穩定資金比率（NSFR）為135.3%，遠高於法定最低要求100%。核心資金…\n\n第二類機構的充足率（CFR）在2021年末為150.3%，同樣高於法定最低要求75%（見圖9）。\n\n圖9 指定人工智能的融資比例\n資料來源：香港金管局。\n\n# 資產品質\n\n全年資產品質維持穩定，並在歷史和國際標準下均保持健康水平。截至2021年底，不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%略為下降，逾期及重組貸款比率亦從同期內的0.57%降至0.56%（見圖表10）。與內地相關貸款的不良貸款比率，截至2021年底為0.86%，較2020年底的0.96%有所改善。住宅按揭貸款及信用卡貸款的不良貸款比率分別維持於低水平，分別為0.04%及0.20%（見圖表11）。香港金管局將繼續密切監察銀行業資產品質的變化。\n\n# 盈利趨勢\n\n低利率環境持續對銀行業的盈利能力造成壓力。 2021年零售銀行稅前經營利潤總額下降了19.8%（見圖12），主要歸因於淨利息收入的減少（-13.6%）和總營運費用的增加（+7.1%）。 儘管如此，手續費及佣金收入的增加（+9.6%）和貸款減損準備的下降（-25.1%）部分抵消了這些影響。 淨利息率進一步收窄至2021年的0.98%，較2020年的1.18%（見圖13）。\n\n零售銀行成本收入比率在2021年上升至54.7%，較2020年的47.0%有所提高（見圖14）。\n"}
{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite the lingering uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.  As the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability since it was implemented in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System has shown its strength and resilience to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability.  This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\n# The Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n\nCertificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks; Government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation; the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances kept with the HKMA; and Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs).  With the HKMA standing ready to sell (or buy) Hong Kong dollars to (or from) banks in exchange for US dollars upon request at 7.75 (or 7.85) per US dollar, when the strong-side (or weak-side) CU is triggered, the Aggregate Balance will expand (or contract) to push down (or up) Hong Kong dollar interest rates that would help move the Hong Kong dollar back to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nDriven by equity-related demand arising from fundraising activities and the southbound Stock Connects1, the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong-side CU at the beginning of the year.  Thereafter, the Hong Kong dollar weakened amid stock market correction and repatriation of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds by some newly listed firms before rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to corporates’ dividend payment needs and net inflows from the southbound Stock Connects.  Stepping into the second half of the year, while the Hong Kong dollar drifted lower amid softened equity market sentiment, it stayed mostly at the strong side of the Convertibility Zone and continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner (Chart 1).  Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2021.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2021\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,526.3 billion in 2021 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, which led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance from HK$457.5 billion at the end of 2020 to HK$377.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nReflecting the additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills and the issuance of EFBNs to absorb EFBNs’ interest payments according to the established practice, the outstanding EFBNs increased from HK$1,069.2 billion to HK$1,148.8 billion during the year.  The Monetary Base as a whole remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# HK$1,526.3 billion\n\nTotal Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance (before Discount Window) and outstanding Exchange Fund papers in 2021\n\n# Money market\n\nWith the sizeable Aggregate Balance, the Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained largely stable at low levels throughout the year (Chart 3).  While the demand for the Hong Kong dollar increased along with the IPO activities during the first quarter, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs) of various tenors saw little fluctuations.  Thereafter, HIBORs remained largely stable despite concerns about the pace of US monetary tightening.  Towards the end of 2021, HIBORs witnessed mild pick-ups, partly reflecting anticipated funding needs towards the year end.  On the retail front, banks kept their Best Lending Rates unchanged.  Overall, Hong Kong’s money markets continued to function normally.  Discount Window borrowing decreased to HK$6.8 billion in 2021 from HK$9.1 billion in 2020.\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2021\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nThe Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has been a strong anchor of Hong Kong’s financial system for more than three decades and has shown its strength and resilience to challenges.  Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic recovery, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to function in an orderly manner, reflecting the robustness of the LERS.  The Government is firmly committed to the LERS.  In its 2021 External Sector Report, the International Monetary Fund once again reiterated that the credibility of the LERS has been assured by a transparent set of rules, ample fiscal and foreign reserves, strong financial regulation and supervision, a flexible economy and a prudent fiscal framework.\n\nA robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS.  Hong Kong’s banking sector continued to operate smoothly with liquidity positions and capitalisation faring very well by international standards.  To ensure resilience of the banking sector, the HKMA has been closely monitoring banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and has maintained its supervisory efforts on bank lending.\n\nTo improve transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998.  The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a range of 109.8–110.5% during 2021, without touching the Upper or the Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 110.2% on 31 December (Chart 4). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.  The ample financial resources of the Exchange Fund, together with the sound banking system, provide a powerful backstop to Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\nChart 4 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2021\n\n# Currency Board Sub-Committee\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong.  In 2021, the CBC considered issues, including an assessment of inflation in the US, implications of the US dollar depreciation on Hong Kong, assessment of the taper tantrum risk and its impact on Hong Kong, and understanding the influence of Mainland-related fund flows on monetary conditions in Hong Kong.  Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and reports on the Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2021, the total value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks in circulation was HK$592.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from a year earlier (Charts 5, 6 and 7). The total value of Government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$12.9 billion at the end of 2021, up 1.7% year on year (Charts 8 and 9).\n\n# HK$592.6 billion, +5.9%\n\nTotal value of banknotes issued by note-issuing banks\n\n# HK$12.9 billion, +1.7%\n\nTotal value of notes and coins issued by Government\n\n# Chart 5\n\nBanknotes in circulation by note-issuing banks at the end of 2021\n\n# Chart 6 \n\nDistribution of banknotes in circulation at the end of 2021\n\n# Hong Kong banknotes\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged 14 seminars for more than 4,000 participants, including professionals in the banking and retail industries as well as students, to help enhance their knowledge and skills in differentiating between authentic and counterfeit banknotes.  These public education programmes on the design and security features of Hong Kong banknotes are well received.\n\n# Coin Collection Programme\n\nThe Coin Collection Programme continued to be well received by the public.  More information about the Programme can be found in the Sustainability chapter on page 198.\n\n# Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\nThe EFBN Programme continued to operate smoothly. To meet the ongoing demand for Exchange Fund paper by banks amid the abundance of liquidity in the banking system, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills in the second half of 2021.  The additional issuance resulted in a corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Balance.  At the end of 2021, the nominal amount of outstanding Exchange Fund papers stood at HK$1,148.6 billion (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Outstanding issues of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes\n\n# Monetary research\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR)  maintained a steady research output in 2021 despite the ongoing pandemic.  During the year, the HKIMR released 30 working papers and held nine webinars, which encompassed a wide range of topics including monetary policy, banking stability, market microstructure and financial technology (fintech) development.  The HKIMR also organised an international conference and a webinar in hybrid format.\n\nThe webinar, titled RMB Exchange Rate Formation Mechanism and Exchange Rate Outlook, was co-organised with the Hong Kong Academy of Finance on 17 August.  It was live-streamed on a number of online platforms and attracted a total of over 1.16 million real-time views.\n\nThe 11th Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled On the Path to Common Prosperity: China’s Economic Development in Dual Circulation, was held on 11 November.

{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe banking sector in Hong Kong remained sound and stable in 2021, despite the emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants, causing uncertainty to global economic recovery.  During the year, the HKMA remained focused on the supervision of authorized institutions’ risk management.  Supervision of authorized institutions’ operational and cyber resilience was also stepped up in light of escalating cyber threats and accelerating digitalisation in the banking sector.\n\nOn conduct supervision, the HKMA provided guidance to banks to facilitate the use of non-face-to-face channels for distributing investment and insurance products, and worked with fellow regulators to formulate supervisory requirements on new products in the market such as insurance-linked securities and virtual assets.  The Code of Banking Practice was also revised to enhance consumer protection in digital financial services.\n\nIn the area of anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT), the HKMA’s priority has been to further strengthen banks’ gatekeeper role in the ecosystem and their ability to prevent and detect illicit fund flows associated with increases in online fraud, mule account networks and other financial crimes during the pandemic.  To increase protection for customer accounts against fraud and financial crimes, the HKMA scaled up collaboration and information sharing with other stakeholders via public-private partnerships.  While supporting remote customer on-boarding, the HKMA also encouraged adoption of other technologies including network analytics through the launch of the first AML Regtech Lab in November.  Internationally, proactive engagement has kept the HKMA at the forefront of global AML\/CFT efforts in the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nOn the development front, the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Pilot Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area was launched smoothly in September.  During the year, the HKMA continued to execute its two-year roadmap for promoting Regtech adoption in Hong Kong.  Several initiatives were rolled out to lay the foundation for banks’ climate risk management and promote green and sustainable banking more broadly, as discussed in the Sustainability chapter. Further efforts were also made in the area of soft infrastructure, including promoting a customercentric corporate culture, as well as working with the banking industry to roll out capacity-building initiatives to facilitate talent development.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA has worked closely with the banking industry in optimising supervisory policies and processes. Good progress was made on implementing international supervisory standards locally, including those on capital adequacy and disclosure.  The HKMA continued to advance its work to ensure a credible resolution regime for authorized institutions, including developing new resolution standards and implementing rules on loss-absorbing capacity requirements to enhance authorized institutions’ resolvability.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system.  Achieving this objective is contingent upon a highly resilient financial system that is capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their businesses and, in extreme cases, by failing in a disorderly manner.  The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that banks are resilient to shocks and able to recover their positions in crises, ultimately helping to prevent failures.  The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banks and is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system.  Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that, in the event of an AI becoming non-viable, its failure can be managed in an orderly manner.  To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong has been established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, among other types of institutions.  To operationalise the resolution regime in Hong Kong, it is important to lay down resolution rules and policy standards, undertake resolution planning to remove impediments to AIs’ resolvability and develop the HKMA’s operational capability to resolve a failing AI.  In order to carry out these tasks effectively, the HKMA adopts an internationally harmonised and co-ordinated approach.\n\nThe Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs). In overseeing FMIs, the HKMA aims to promote their general safety and efficiency, limit systemic risk and foster transparency.  Making FMIs more resilient to financial crises protects the monetary and financial systems in Hong Kong from possible destabilising effects arising from disruption to the FMIs.  Information regarding the HKMA’s oversight approach is available on the HKMA website.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Licensing\n\nAt the end of 2021, Hong Kong had:\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA granted two banking licences and one restricted bank licence to three non-local banks. The HKMA also granted a money broker approval to a foreign trading platform operator.  The authorizations of three licensed banks and two restricted licence banks were revoked during the year.\n\nMore information about the AIs and local representative offices in Hong Kong can be found in the Annex and Tables D to F on pages 321 to 324, and 330 to 333 respectively.\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nThe HKMA conducted 189 off-site reviews covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL rating assessment1, corporate governance, risk management and financial technology (fintech) strategies.  As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance, 40 meetings were held with the AIs’ boards of directors, independent non-executive directors or board-level committees.  A further 38 tripartite meetings were held among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA conducted regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk.  A total of 679 on-site examinations and thematic reviews were carried out during the year with credit risk management as a key focus. Amid growing adoption of technology by banks, management of operational risk and technology risk was another major area of attention.  The HKMA also increased the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeting liquidity and market risk management.  In addition, specialist teams performed on-site examinations and thematic reviews of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF)- related businesses, as well as their anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) controls. Table 1 contains a summary of the HKMA’s supervisory activities in 2021.\n\n# Credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal loans increased by 3.8% in 2021, compared with a growth of 1.2% in 2020.  Table 2 shows the breakdown of growth in loans and advances.\n\nMainland-related lending increased by 3.6% to HK$4,725 billion in 2021 (Table 3).\n\nThe asset quality of the banking sector remained largely stable during the year and stayed at a healthy level by both historical and international standards.  The classified loan ratio of the industry was 0.88% at the end of 2021, down from 0.90% at the end of 2020, well below the long-run historical average of 1.8% since 2000.  The ratio for Mainland-related lending also decreased to 0.86% from 0.96% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on some sectors of the economy, while credit events in the Mainland property sector caught the attention of the market.  The HKMA enhanced the breadth and depth of its surveillance, with deep-dive reviews focused on banks’ exposures to highly leveraged borrowers. Close communication with banks has been maintained to facilitate up-to-date assessment of the impact of economic and market developments as well as the adequacy of banks’ risk management measures.  The overall credit risk facing the banking sector is assessed to be manageable.  The latest results of the HKMA’s solvency stress tests confirm that the banking sector continues to maintain sufficient capital buffers to withstand extreme stress.\n\nTargeted and thematic examinations were conducted during the year to evaluate AIs’ systems and controls over loan classification and loan loss provisioning, overseas lending operations, and collateralised lending to private banking and wealth management customers.\n\n# Alleviating cash-flow pressure faced by customers\n\nIn September, the HKMA and the Banking Sector Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Lending Coordination Mechanism announced a six-month extension of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme until the end of April 2022.  This scheme was first launched in May 2020 to defer loan principal payments of eligible corporate customers by six months.  In light of a resurgence of local coronavirus infections, in February 2022, the scheme was further extended until the end of October 2022.  In addition, the scheme was enhanced to offer a one-year partial principal repayment option to those customers who are financially capable and willing to resume principal repayment gradually.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, banks had approved loan tenor extensions and other forms of relief in over 83,000 cases, involving an aggregate amount of over HK$920 billion. For personal customers, banks had approved more than 52,000 cases of principal payment holidays for residential mortgages and other personal relief loans, amounting to over HK$53 billion.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nThe successive rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced by the HKMA since 2009 have strengthened banks’ risk management and the banking sector’s resilience to a possible abrupt downturn in the local property market.  The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of new residential mortgage loans (RMLs) approved in December 2021 was 53%, compared with 64% in September 2009 before the countercyclical measures were first introduced.  The average debt servicing ratio (DSR) of new mortgages remained low at 36% in December 2021, compared with 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\n# Operational and technology risks\n\nIn light of banks’ increasing reliance on technology to support their operations, the HKMA stepped up supervision of operational and technology risks.  Key supervisory focuses during the year included controls over cloud outsourcing and remote working arrangements.  The HKMA launched an industry consultation in December on a draft new Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module on “Operational Resilience”. The new SPM module seeks to provide guidance to banks on developing a holistic and integrated operational resilience framework.\n\nThe HKMA introduced the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 in January to reflect the latest sound practices on cyber security risk management.  During the year, the HKMA monitored AIs’ implementation of the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework 2.0 and reviewed their cyber resilience capabilities.  In view of the growing risk of destructive cyber-attacks, in May, the HKMA requested all AIs to critically assess the need for a secure tertiary data backup, taking reference from the Secure Tertiary Data Backup Guideline issued by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nIn response to heightened risks and rising numbers of phishing attacks, the HKMA worked closely with the industry to strengthen the security of internet and mobile banking services.  A large-scale joint HKMA-HKAB public awareness campaign, themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” began in July (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Raising public awareness of phishing attacks\n\nSlogan icon for the public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!”\n\n# Liquidity and market risks\n\nTo enhance monitoring of AIs’ liquidity risk exposures, the HKMA introduced additional scenarios into its liquidity stress testing framework to evaluate AIs’ ability to cope with liquidity shocks over a prolonged period.\n\nDuring the year, thematic reviews were conducted to assess the adequacy of AIs’ liquidity stress testing programmes and evaluate the sufficiency of their monitoring metrics and control limits for managing liquidity risk.  The HKMA also carried out reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of AIs’ market risk management frameworks for debt securities investments and operational controls over treasury activities.\n\nThe HKMA closely monitored AIs’ progress in preparing for the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  It collaborated with industry associations and developed tools to assist AIs in supporting their customers’ migration to alternative reference rates, including a leaflet to raise corporates’ awareness of the transition and an information note on options available in the loan markets to replace US dollar LIBOR.  AIs have substantially remediated contracts referencing LIBOR settings which ceased to be published after the end of 2021.  They were reminded not to enter into new LIBOR contracts from 1 January 2022 onwards.\n","zh":"# 銀行穩定性\n\n儘管新型冠狀病毒變異株出現，為全球經濟復甦帶來不確定性，香港的銀行業在2021年仍然保持穩健和穩定。 該年，香港金管局繼續專注於監察持牌金融機構的風險管理。 隨著網絡威脅加劇以及銀行業的數字化加速，持牌金融機構的營運及網絡韌性監察亦有所加強。\n\n在監察銀行營運方面，金管局已向銀行提供指引，以便利銀行利用非面對面渠道分銷投資及保險產品，並與其他監管機構合作，制定有關市場上新產品（例如：保險相關證券及虛擬資產）的監察要求。銀行業行為守則亦已更新，以加強在數碼金融服務中的消費者保護。\n\n在打擊洗錢及 терроризм融資（AML\/CFT）領域，香港金管局的首要任務是進一步強化銀行在生態系統中的把關角色，以及其在疫情期間，應對因網絡欺詐、水客網絡及其他金融犯罪增加而導致的非法資金流動的能力。為提升客戶帳戶免受欺詐及金融犯罪的保護，金管局透過公私合作夥伴關係，加強與其他持份者的合作及資訊交流。在支持遠程客戶開戶的同時，金管局亦鼓勵採用其他技術，包括透過於十一月成立首個洗錢防範科技實驗室，推廣網絡分析技術。在國際上，金管局積極參與，使其在金融行動任務執行機構的全球 AML\/CFT 努力中處於領先地位。\n\n在發展方面，粵港澳大灣區跨境財富管理互聯互通試驗計劃於九月順利啟動。年內，香港金管局持續推行為期兩年的香港鼓勵採用金融科技的路線圖。多項倡議推出，為銀行氣候風險管理奠定基礎，並更廣泛地推動綠色和可持續性銀行業，詳情請參閱「可持續發展」章節。此外，亦在軟基礎設施領域加強了努力，包括推廣以客戶為中心的企業文化，以及與銀行業界合作，推出能力建設倡議，以促進人才發展。\n\n同時，香港金管局一直與銀行業緊密合作，優化監管政策和流程。在本地實施國際監管標準方面取得了良好進展，包括資本充足率和信息披露方面的標準。香港金管局繼續推進工作，以確保為持牌金融機構建立可信的解決機制，包括制定新的解決方案標準，以及實施損失吸收能力要求，從而提升持牌金融機構的可解決性。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港金管局的一般目標是促進銀行體系的穩定和安全。實現此目標取決於一個高度穩健的金融體系，能夠為香港經濟所需提供關鍵的金融服務。\n\n銀行在營運方式及極端情況下的無序倒閉，都可能影響整個金融體系的穩定性。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演著關鍵角色，致力於確保銀行能夠承受衝擊並在危機中恢復其狀況，從而最終有助於預防倒閉事件。 金融管理局負責對銀行進行審慎監察，並有權在香港授權持牌銀行、限牌銀行和從事存款業務的公司，這些機構統稱為持牌金融機構（AIs）。\n\n然而，金管局無法保證，亦無香港的審慎監管框架旨在保證零風險的金融體系。相反，金管局作為解決機制權威，致力於確保在人工智能機構（AI）出現不可行情況時，其失敗能夠有序處理。為此，香港已建立金融機構解決機制，根據該機制，金管局是人工智能機構（AI）等其他機構的解決機制權威。為在香港推行解決機制，制定解決機制規則和政策標準、進行解決機制規劃以消除人工智能機構（AI）可解決性上的障礙，以及發展金管局解決失敗人工智能機構（AI）的運作能力至關重要。為有效執行這些任務，金管局採取國際協調一致的方法。\n\n金管局亦負責指定及監察若干金融市場基礎設施（FMI）。在監察FMI時，金管局旨在促進其整體安全及效率，限制系統性風險，並鼓勵透明度。提升FMI對金融危機的韌性，有助於保障香港的貨幣及金融系統免受FMI中斷可能造成的 destabilizing 影響。有關金管局監察方法的資訊，可在金管局網站上找到。\n\n# 2021 回顧\n\n# 授權條款\n\n截至2021年底，香港擁有：\n\n年內，香港金管局批出兩項銀行牌照及一張有限制銀行牌照予三間外地銀行。香港金管局同時亦批准一間外國交易平台營運商成為貨幣經紀。年內，三間持牌銀行及兩間有限制牌照銀行被吊銷牌照。\n\n有關人工智能及香港本地代表處的更多資訊，請參閱附件及第321至324頁、以及第330至333頁的D至F表格。\n\n# 監督活動概述\n\n金管局已進行了189項離地審核，涵蓋了廣泛議題，包括CAMEL評級評估、企業管治、風險管理及金融科技（Fintech）策略。為持續加強風險監管，金管局共舉行了40場會議，與持牌金融機構的董事會、獨立非執行董事或董事層級委員會進行交流。此外，金管局、持牌金融機構及其外部審計師還舉行了38場三方會議。\n\n除了離地檢查外，金管局亦有進行定期實地審查，並配合針對評估風險較高的範疇進行主題審查。 該年共進行了679項實地審查和主題審查，其中信貸風險管理是重點關注的領域。 隨著銀行對科技的應用日益普及，營運風險和科技風險的管理亦是另一大關注點。 金管局同時增加了針對流動性風險和市場風險管理的實地審查和主題審查數量。 此外，專業團隊亦對金融科技公司的證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動，以及其反洗錢及打擊恐怖融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施進行實地審查和主題審查。 第一節載有金管局2021年的監管活動概要。\n\n# 信用風險\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n2021年貸款總額較2020年增長3.8%，而2020年增長了1.2%。第二表顯示貸款及墊款的增長細節。\n\n中國內地相關貸款於2021年增長3.6%，至4,7250億港元（見表3）。\n\n銀行業資產品質在年內大致保持穩定，並維持在歷史和國際標準下皆健康的水平。截至2021年底，該行業的不良貸款比率為0.88%，較2020年底的0.90%有所下降，遠低於自2000年以來的長期歷史平均水平1.8%。與中國大陸相關的貸款比率也從一年前的0.96%下降至0.86%。\n\n全年，新冠疫情持續對部分經濟領域構成壓力，而內地物業領域的信用事件亦引起市場關注。香港金管局加強了監察的廣度和深度，並進行深入審查，重點關注銀行對高杠杆借款人的風險敞口。與銀行保持密切溝通，以促進對經濟及市場發展影響的即時評估，以及評估銀行風險管理措施的充分性。評估銀行體系面臨的整體信貸風險可控。香港金管局最新壓力測試結果顯示，銀行體系持續維持充足的資本儲備，足以應對極端壓力。\n\n為評估人工智能系統在貸款分類、貸款損失準備、海外貸款業務以及向私人銀行和資產管理客戶提供擔保貸款方面的系統及控制，全年進行了有針對性和主題性的審查。\n\n# 紓解客戶面臨的現金流壓力\n\n金管局與銀行業中小企業貸款協調機制於九月宣布，延遲償還本金計劃（Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme）將會延期六個月，至二零二二年四月底為止。此計劃最初於二零二零年五月推出，旨在讓合資格的公司客戶延遲貸款本金償還六個月。 鑑於本地新冠肺炎疫情再次爆發，金管局於二零二二年二月進一步將計劃延期至二零二二年十月底。 此外，計劃亦已加強，為財務能力較佳且有意逐步恢復本金償還的客戶提供一年的部分本金償還選擇。\n\n截至2021年12月底，銀行已批准超過83,000宗貸款寬限延期及其他紓緩措施，涉及總金額超過9200億港元。就個人客戶而言，銀行已批准超過52,000宗住宅按揭及其他個人紓緩貸款的本金還款寬限，總額超過530億港元。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n自二零零九年起，香港金管局陸續推出的逆周期宏觀審慎措施，已強化了銀行業的風險管理，以及對本地物業市場可能出現急挫的抵禦能力。截至二零二一年十二月，獲批新住宅按揭貸款（RML）的平均貸款按值（LTV）比例為百分之五十三，較二零零九年九月首次推出逆周期措施前的百分之六十四有所下降。截至二零二一年十二月，新按揭貸款的平均還款壓力比率（DSR）維持在低水平，為百分之三十六，較二零一零年八月首次應用還款壓力比率上限時的百分之四十一更低（見圖一）。\n\n# 營運及科技風險\n\n鑒於銀行對技術的依賴日益增加，以支持其營運，香港金管局加強了對營運及科技風險的監察。 年內的主要監察重點包括對雲端外包及遠程工作安排的管控。香港金管局於十二月展開業界諮詢，就《監察政策指引》 (SPM) 新編章「營運穩健」的草案版本。 該新編章旨在為銀行提供指引，以制定全面且整合的營運穩健架構。\n\n香港金管局於一月推出《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》，以反映最新的網絡安全風險管理良好做法。 期間，金管局監察了持牌金融機構（AIs）對《網絡韌性評估框架2.0》的落實情況，並審閱了它們的網絡韌性能力。 鑒於破壞性網絡攻擊的風險日益增加，金管局於五月要求所有持牌金融機構嚴格評估是否需要安全的輔助數據備份，並可參考香港銀行同業公會（HKAB）發布的《安全輔助數據備份指引》。\n\n為應對日益增加的風險及釣魚網絡襲擊事件，香港金融管理局與業界緊密合作，加強互聯網及流動支付銀行服務的安全性。一項大型的香港金融管理局及香港銀行同業公會聯合公眾教育宣傳活動，以「保護您的個人數碼密匙，小心詐騙連結！」為主題，已於七月展開（見圖1）。\n\n圖一 提高公眾對釣魚攻擊的認識\n\n保護您的個人數位密鑰，小心詐騙連結！\n\n# 流動性及市場風險\n\n為加強監控人工智能（AI）的流動性風險，香港金管局已將更多情境納入其流動性壓力測試框架中，以評估人工智能應對長時間流動性衝擊的能力。\n\n在年內，進行了主題審查，以評估金融機構的流動性壓力測試計劃是否充分，並評估其監測指標和控制限度在管理流動性風險方面的有效性。香港金管局亦進行了審查，評估金融機構就債務證券投資的市場風險管理框架及對庫務活動的營運控制是否有效。\n\n金管局密切監察金融機構為過渡脫離倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）所作的準備。 金管局與業界協會合作，並開發工具以協助金融機構支持客戶轉向替代參考利率，包括一份旨在提高企業對過渡變化的關注的單張宣傳資料，以及一份關於貸款市場中可取代美元LIBOR的選項的資訊摘要。 金融機構已大幅度修補了參考LIBOR報值的合約，這些報值已於2021年底停止發布。 金融機構獲提醒，自2022年1月1日起，切勿訂立新的LIBOR合約。\n"}
{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nDuring 2021, the HKMA achieved good progress in strengthening Hong Kong’s status as a globally competitive international financial centre through a multi-pronged approach.\n\nThe HKMA unveiled “Fintech 2025” strategy to promote the wide adoption of fintech by the financial sector and bolster Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub more broadly.  On the Faster Payment System, it has seen a surge in turnover during the year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn enhancing connectivity, significant progress was made during the year with the addition of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect and Southbound Trading under Bond Connect to the suite of Connect schemes.  Thanks to its world-class market infrastructure and the Connect schemes, Hong Kong is the favoured platform for Mainland funds to tap into global markets and for international investors to access the fast-growing Mainland markets.\n\nAlso during 2021, the HKMA devoted significant efforts in creating new business opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform, in areas including bond issuance, asset and wealth management, corporate treasury centres, and green and sustainable finance.  To promote Hong Kong’s financial services, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to overseas and Mainland stakeholders to keep them informed about the resilience of Hong Kong’s financial system and the prospects it presents.\n\nMeanwhile, the HKMA is active in international and regional central banking and regulatory forums, contributing to global efforts in maintaining financial stability and promoting financial market developments.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA announced its “Fintech 2025” strategy, covering a series of initiatives to promote wide adoption of financial technology (fintech) and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.  The HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments, played a pivotal role in driving various key initiatives during the year including the following:\n\n- Promoting regulatory technology (Regtech) adoption\n- Rolling out the Tech Baseline Assessment to understand banks' adoption of fintech\n\nHong Kong’s position as an offshore renminbi hub remained firm, with offshore renminbi businesses registering robust growth during the year.  Inflows into renminbi assets continued to gather pace as the inclusion of onshore securities in major financial market indices continued. Hong Kong plays an indispensable role in facilitating international investors’ increased allocation to renminbi assets, with the Mainland–Hong Kong Connect schemes being widely accepted as the channels of choice for international investors to access onshore capital markets. In 2021, daily turnover under Northbound Bond Connect increased 34% to around RMB25.8 billion.\n\nFollowing the success of Northbound Bond Connect, Southbound Bond Connect was launched in September, completing the two-way connection between the Mainland and international bond markets.  In the same month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Macao promulgated the implementation details for the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (Crossboundary WMC) Scheme in the Guangdong–Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).  In October, eligible banks in Hong Kong started providing Cross-boundary WMC services together with their Mainland partner banks.\n\n\n\nTo enhance Hong Kong’s role as a key offshore renminbi centre, a working group comprising the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) was formed to conduct a feasibility study on promoting trading of renminbi-denominated equity securities in Hong Kong.  A joint seminar was also co-organised by the PBoC and the HKMA in December, showcasing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a leading renminbi business hub.\n\nThe HKMA continues to make progress towards strengthening the competitiveness of Hong Kong’s financial platform.  In particular, to increase Hong Kong’s appeal as a preferred fund domicile, the HKMA worked closely with the Government and the financial industry to provide a more facilitating tax and regulatory environment for fund formation.  Significant strides were also made in further elevating Hong Kong’s position as a regional green and sustainable finance hub, and as a bond issuance centre. At the same time, the HKMA stepped up market outreach to promote Hong Kong’s financial services to overseas and Mainland stakeholders.\n\nSafe and efficient operation of financial infrastructure is fundamental for reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a leading international financial centre.  In 2021, the four interbank Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the Hong Kong Trade Repository achieved 100%1 system availability, outperforming the target of 99.95%.  Following the launch of Southbound Bond Connect in September, the CMU became the settlement and custodian service provider for transactions conducted under both Northbound and Southbound Bond Connect.\n\nAdoption of the FPS continued to expand in 2021. The number of registrations grew to 9.6 million at the end of 2021 and the average daily turnover for the year rose by 90% from 2020.  Increased use of the FPS for settling Government bills, making merchant payments and topping up stored value facility (SVF) e-wallets or bank accounts were the key drivers for the continued rise in transaction volume, on top of a steady growth in person-to-person and business payments.\n\nTo promote the safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA oversees six designated retail payment systems (RPSs) and supervises 15 licensed SVFs under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO).  During the year, the HKMA facilitated the smooth implementation of the Government’s Consumption Voucher Scheme by co-ordinating and promoting dialogues and co-operation between the relevant Government parties and the SVF licensees appointed for the scheme.\n\nIn January 2022, the HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, setting out the HKMA’s thinking on the relevant regulatory approach and inviting views from stakeholders.  Relevant factors, including feedback to this discussion paper and recommendations of relevant international bodies, will be taken into account when drawing up the appropriate regulatory regime.\n\nInternationally, the HKMA is an active member of the central banking community and plays a leadership role in a number of regional and international committees.  For example, the HKMA chairs the Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) established under the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)2.  The HKMA also co-chairs the Policy and Standards Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the Non-Bank Monitoring Experts Group and the Financial Innovation Network of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and leads a team that looks into supervisory issues associated with financial benchmark transition.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2021\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Fintech 2025\n\nIn June, the HKMA unveiled its “Fintech 2025” strategy to drive fintech development in Hong Kong.  The strategy aims to encourage the financial sector to adopt technology comprehensively by 2025, as well as to promote the provision of fair and efficient financial services for the benefit of Hong Kong citizens and the economy.  The five focus areas of the strategy are:\n\n- All banks go fintech\n- Future-proofing Hong Kong for CBDCs\n- Creating the next-generation data infrastructure\n- Expanding the fintech-savvy workforce\n- Nurturing the ecosystem with funding and policies\n\nThe HKMA’s “Fintech 2025” strategy drives fintech development in Hong Kong\n\n# Fintech Adoption in the Banking Sector\n\nTo support the “All banks go fintech” initiative of the “Fintech 2025” strategy, the HKMA rolled out the Tech Baseline Assessment in June 2021.  The assessment aims to help the HKMA develop a better understanding of the current fintech landscape in the banking sector, and identify which fintech areas may warrant the HKMA’s support.  All licensed banks with significant operations in Hong Kong were requested to develop a three-year plan for fintech adoption by the end of 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA also continued to implement its two-year roadmap to promote Regtech adoption by banks in Hong Kong, and incorporate technology in its own supervisory processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  See page 98 of the Banking Stability chapter for more details.\n\n# Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nThe HKMA and the Bank of Thailand expanded the scope of their joint research project with the joining of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC in February 2021.  Renamed as “Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge)” and strongly supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the project further explores the capabilities of distributed ledger technology to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24\/7 basis.  A joint report was published in September to deliver the interim findings, followed by the publication of potential use cases and a future roadmap in November.\n\n# Retail Central Bank Digital Currency\n\nTo future-proof Hong Kong in terms of CBDC readiness, the HKMA started a study on the prospect of issuing retail CBDC in Hong Kong, i.e. e-HKD, covering both technical and policy considerations.  In collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Hong Kong, the HKMA embarked on a study called Project Aurum to explore the technical aspect of issuing retail CBDC.  Separately, an internal cross-departmental working group was set up to study the relevant technical, policy and legal issues.  In October, the HKMA released a technical white paper titled e-HKD: A technical perspective to explore and invite comments on potential technical design options for issuing and distributing retail CBDC.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA supports the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC on the technical pilot testing of using e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.  This will help promote interconnection in the GBA and bring greater convenience to Hong Kong and Mainland tourists by enhancing the efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payments.\n\n# Commercial Data Interchange\n\nIn July, the HKMA hosted a virtual symposium to encourage banks and SVF operators to join the CDI, a next-generation financial data infrastructure that aims to enable more efficient financial intermediation in the banking system.  To further facilitate development and adoption, the launch of the CDI Innovation Hub was announced during the symposium. To facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, the HKMA completed two phases of proof-of-concept study examining the technical feasibility of the CDI.  Applying alternative data to facilitate credit assessment and the underwriting of loans, more than 550 SME loans exceeding HK$900 million in total were approved by the participating banks during the study.  Based on the encouraging results, the HKMA announced the pilot launch of the CDI in November.\n\nSME owners commend the CDI for streamlining their loan applications\n\n# Talent development\n\nTo expand the fintech talent pool, the HKMA continued to run the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme 2.0 in collaboration with its strategic partners3 to nurture young talent at various stages of their career development. More than 180 students benefitted from the scheme in 2021. Separately, the Industry Project Masters Network scheme was piloted in September to provide opportunities for master’s degree students majoring in fintech to work on real-life fintech projects.  To form strategic partnerships and foster collaboration in areas including fintech talent development, the HKMA entered into memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four local universities in October.\n\nMr Colin Pou (middle), Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of HKMA, at the MoU signing ceremony with four local universities\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe use of Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) continued to rise during the year.  As of end-December 2021, a total of 234 pilot trials of fintech initiatives had been allowed in the FSS since its launch in 2016, compared with 193 as of end-2020.  As of end-December 2021, the HKMA had also received in total 666 requests to access the FSS Chatroom for supervisory feedback at the early stage of fintech projects since the introduction of the Chatroom in 2017.  Over 63% of the Chatroom requests were made by technology firms (tech firms) .\n","zh":"# 國際金融中心\n\n在2021年，香港金管局透過多管齊下的方式，在鞏固香港作為全球具競爭力的國際金融中心地位方面取得顯著進展。\n\n金管局公佈《金融科技2025》策略，旨在推廣金融界廣泛採用金融科技，並進一步鞏固香港作為金融科技樞紐的地位。在快速支付系統方面，在新冠疫情期間錄得交易額顯著增長。\n\n在加強互聯互通方面，年內取得顯著進展，跨境財富管理聯繫計劃及債券通南向交易已納入「互聯互通」計劃體系。 憑藉世界一流的市場基礎設施以及「互聯互通」計劃，香港已成為內地基金連接全球市場，以及國際投資者接觸快速增長的內地市場的首選平台。\n\n在2021年，香港金管局亦投入了大量資源，致力於開拓新的商機，以強化香港金融平台的競爭力，重點領域包括債券發行、資產及財富管理、企業財務中心，以及綠色及可持續金融。為推廣香港的金融服務，香港金管局加強了與海外及內地持份者的市場聯繫，向他們介紹香港金融體系的穩健性以及其所蘊含的發展前景。\n\n同時，香港金管局亦積極參與國際及區內中央銀行和監管機構的論壇，為維護全球金融穩定及促進金融市場發展貢獻力量。\n\n# 總覽\n\n香港金管局宣布其「金融科技2025」策略，涵蓋一系列推動金融科技（Fintech）廣泛應用及鞏固香港亞洲金融科技樞紐地位的舉措。香港金管局金融科技促進辦事處（FFO）與銀行部門合作，在過去一年中在推動多項關鍵倡議方面發揮了關鍵作用，其中包括：\n\n推動監管科技（Regtech）的應用。\n發布科技基礎評估，以了解銀行對金融科技的採用情況。\n\n香港作為離岸人民幣樞紐的地位穩固，年內離岸人民幣業務錄得強勁增長。 隨著主要金融市場指數持續納入內地證券，流入人民幣資產的步伐持續加快。 香港在促進國際投資者增加配置於人民幣資產方面扮演著不可或缺的角色，而粵港兩地通互市機制已廣泛被視為國際投資者進入內地資本市場的首選途徑。 截至2021年，北向通的每日成交額增長34%，達到約258億元人民幣。\n\n繼滬港債券通成功推出後，深港債券通於九月啟動，完成了內地與國際債券市場的雙向互聯互通。同月，中國人民銀行、香港金管局及澳門金融管理局聯合頒布了粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通計劃的具體執行細則。十月份，香港合資格銀行開始與其內地合作銀行一同提供跨境理財通服務。\n\n\n\n為提升香港作為主要離岸人民幣中心的作用，香港金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及香港交易所（港交所）組成工作小組，進行一項可行性研究，探討在香港推廣人民幣計值股本證券交易。中國人民銀行與香港金管局亦於十二月合辦研討會，展示香港作為國際金融中心及領先人民幣業務樞紐的地位。\n\n金管局持續推進香港金融平台的競爭力提升工作。尤其為提升香港作為首選基金托管地的吸引力，金管局與政府及金融業界緊密合作，為基金成立提供更具促進性的稅務及監管環境。在進一步提升香港作為區域綠色及可持續金融中心，以及債券發行中心的地位方面，亦取得顯著進展。同時，金管局加強市場推廣，向海外及內地持份者宣介香港的金融服務。\n\n維護金融基礎設施的安全高效運作，是鞏固香港作為國際金融中心領導地位的根本。 2021年，四個銀行間即時總額結算系統（RTGS）、中央貨幣市場服務單位的（CMU）及香港交易存儲庫均實現了100%系統可用率，超出目標的99.95%。 隨著 southbound 債券通於九月推出，中央貨幣市場服務單位成為了 northbound 及 southbound 債券通交易的結算及保管服務提供者。\n\n二零二一年，即時支付系統（FPS）的使用持續擴展。截至二零二一年底，註冊人數已增至九百六十萬，全年平均每日交易額較二零二零年上升了九十分之九十。政府賬單繳付、商戶付款以及為儲值易（SVF）電子錢包或銀行戶口充值等用途的增加，是交易量持續增長的主要推動力，再加上個人對個人和企業之間的付款穩步增長。\n\n為促進本地零售支付業界的安全及效率，香港金管局監察六個指定零售支付系統（RPSs），並根據《支付系統及預付卡發牌條例》（PSSVFO）對十五間已發牌預付卡發行商（SVFs）進行監管。 於本年度，金管局協調各相關政府部門及獲委任為此計劃的預付卡發行商，並促進行對話及合作，以促成政府消費券計劃的順利推行。\n\n二零二二年一月，香港金融管理局發布了一份關於加密資產及穩定幣的討論文件，闡述了金管局對相關監管方法的構想，並邀請各持份者提供意見。 制定適當的監管制度時，將會考慮相關因素，包括對該討論文件的回饋以及相關國際機構的建議。\n\n國際上，香港金管局是中央銀行社群的積極參與者，並在多個地區和國際委員會中發揮領導作用。例如，香港金管局主持由東亞太平洋地區中央銀行理事會（EMEAP）下設立的金融市場工作小組（WGFM）。此外，香港金管局同時擔任巴塞爾銀行監管委員會（Basel Committee）的政策與標準組、非銀行監察專家組以及金融穩定理事會（FSB）的金融創新網絡的共同主席，並領導一個團隊，研究與金融指標轉換相關的監管問題。\n\n# 2021 回顧\n\n# 亞洲金融科技樞紐：香港\n\n# 金融科技2025\n\n六月，香港金融管理局發布《金融科技2025》策略，旨在推動香港的金融科技發展。該策略力求在2025年前鼓勵金融界全面採用科技，並促進提供公平且高效的金融服務，以惠及香港市民和經濟。該策略的五個重點領域如下：\n\n各銀行紛趨擁抱金融科技\n為香港做好中央銀行數字貨幣的準備\n構建下一代數據基礎設施\n擴充具備金融科技知識的勞動力\n以資金和政策扶持生態系統發展\n\n香港金融管理局的「金融科技2025」策略，推動香港的金融科技發展。\n\n# 銀行業金融科技應用\n\n為支持「全體銀行擁抱金融科技」的「金融科技2025」策略，香港金管局於2021年六月推出「科技基礎評估」。此評估旨在幫助金管局更深入地了解香港銀行業現時的金融科技發展現況，並識別出哪些金融科技領域可能需要金管局的支持。所有在香港擁有重要業務的持牌銀行，被要求於2021年底前制定為期三年的金融科技應用計劃。\n\n在年內，香港金管局亦繼續推行為期兩年的路線圖，以促進香港銀行採用監管科技（Regtech），並將科技融入其自身的監察流程，藉此提升效率及成效。有關更多詳情，請參閱《銀行穩定性》一章第98頁。\n\n# 批發中央銀行數字貨幣\n\n香港金管局及泰國銀行於2021年2月擴大了其聯合研究項目的範圍，並加入了阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行及中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所。該項目被更名為「多中央銀行數字貨幣互聯橋」(mBridge)，並得到國際結算銀行（BIS）香港創新中心的大力支持，進一步探討區塊鏈技術在多司法管轄區範圍內，以24小時不間斷方式促進實時跨境外匯支付對付支付(PvP)交易的能力。一份聯合報告於九月發布，匯報了中期發現，其後於十一月發布了潛在應用案例及未來發展藍圖。\n\n# 零售中央銀行數字貨幣\n\n為確保香港在央票（CBDC）準備方面的前瞻性，香港金管局已展開一項研究，探討在香港發行零售央票（即電子港元，e-HKD）的可行性，涵蓋技術及政策層面。香港金管局與香港BIS創新中心合作，啟動名為「金脈計劃」（Project Aurum）的研究，以探討發行零售央票的技術層面。 另外，金管局亦成立了一個跨部門內部工作小組，研究相關的技術、政策及法律問題。 十月份，金管局發布了一份名為《電子港元：技術視角》（e-HKD: A technical perspective）的技術白皮書，旨在探討並徵求公眾對發行及分發零售央票的潛在技術設計方案的意見。\n\n此外，香港金管局亦支持中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所，就利用eCNY進行跨境支付的技術試點合作。此舉有助於促進大灣區互聯互通，並透過提升跨境支付的效率及用戶體驗，為香港及內地旅客帶來更大的便利。\n\n# 商業數據交換\n\n七月份，香港金管局舉辦了一場虛擬研討會，鼓勵銀行和 SVF 營運商加入中央數據基礎設施（CDI），這是一項旨在促進銀行體系更有效率的金融中介的新一代金融數據基礎設施。為進一步促進發展和採用，研討會上宣布成立中央數據基礎設施創新中心。為促進中小企業（SME）融資，香港金管局完成了中央數據基礎設施的兩個概念驗證階段，以研究其技術可行性。在研究期間，參與銀行應用替代數據進行信貸評估和貸款承保，共批准了超過 550 筆中小企業貸款，總額超過 9 億港元。 根據令人鼓舞的結果，香港金管局宣布於十一月展開中央數據基礎設施試點上線。\n\n中小企業老闆們稱讚CDI簡化了他們的貸款申請流程。\n\n# 人才發展\n\n為擴充金融科技人才庫，香港金融管理局持續與策略合作夥伴共同推行「金融科技職涯加速計劃2.0」，致力於各個職業發展階段培養年輕人才。 2021年，超過180名學生從計劃中受益。 另外，為提供金融科技專業碩士學位課程學生參與真實金融科技專案的機會，於九月試行「業界項目碩士網絡」計劃。 為建立策略合作關係，並在包括金融科技人才發展等領域促進合作，香港金融管理局於十月與四所本地大學簽訂諒解備忘錄。\n\n香港金管局執行董事（金融基礎設施）周凱文先生（中）於與四所本地大學簽署諒解備忘錄儀式上。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n金融科技監管沙盒（FSS）的使用量在年內持續上升。截至2021年12月底，自2016年推出以來，共有234項金融科技倡議的試點計劃獲得在FSS進行，較2020年底的193項有所增加。截至2021年12月底，香港金融管理局自2017年引入聊天室以來，總共收到666項請求，以尋求金融科技項目早期階段的監管回饋，透過FSS聊天室進行。超過63%的聊天室請求均由科技公司提出。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global financial markets embarked on a recovery path in 2021.  Although the global economy continued to be affected by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic situation, a number of factors, including an increasing vaccination rate as well as accommodative monetary policies and fiscal measures around the world, have contributed to notable recovery in the global economy and financial markets.  Against this background, a number of overseas equity markets achieved record highs during the year, and the Exchange Fund’s overall equity holdings were able to achieve a decent return despite the sluggish performance in Hong Kong equities. During 2021, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion, representing an investment return of 4.1%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.  The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre.  The HKMA, under the delegated authority of the Financial Secretary and within the terms of the delegation, is responsible to the Financial Secretary for the use and investment management of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(i) to preserve capital;\n(ii) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(iii) to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(iv) subject to (i)–(iii), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Exchange Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Portfolio Segregation of the Exchange Fund\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP).  The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP invests primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of its assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA diversifies part of the Exchange Fund’s investments in a prudent and incremental manner into a wider variety of asset classes.  This includes emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity (including infrastructure), and real estate.  Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP).  The HKMA has put in place a cap1 to guide the pace of diversification into the LTGP since its inception.  As the LTGP has become increasingly mature in investment scale and asset diversity, the EFAC decided in January 2022 to replace the cap by a target asset allocation that is determined concurrently with that of other asset classes, subject to prudent risk management principles.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007, holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that have been acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes.  The Strategic Portfolio is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of its unique nature.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by Fiscal Reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP2, with the major exception of the Future Fund3, which links its interest rate to the return of both the IP and the LTGP in accordance with the portfolio mix.  The portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 40:60 in 2021.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation.  The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents long-term asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund.  Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark.  This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark (or strategic) allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”.  While the benchmark and tracking error4 limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with the EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority.  Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may assume positions to take advantage of short-term market movements (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Asset allocation of the Exchange Fund\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nThe HKMA’s Exchange Fund Investment Office houses its investment and related risk management functions. Exchange Fund Investment Office staff members directly manage about 71% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, comprising the entire BP and part of the IP.  This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 29% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes.  The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to realise sustainable returns, draw on diverse and complementary investment styles, and gain market insights and technical expertise in investment.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes.  The expenditure is determined primarily by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe growing complexity of the investment environment underlines the importance of risk management.  The HKMA sets stringent controls and investment guidelines for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and ensures a proper risk monitoring and compliance system is in place. Three lines of defence are in place to implement effective risk management and governance of investment-related activities.  Key risk categories (including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks) are regularly monitored, and the risk management process provides a robust framework to support strategic planning and investment diversification.\n\n# RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\n\nThe HKMA believes that, by putting an appropriate emphasis on responsible investment and sustainable long-term economic performance, it can better achieve the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund and reduce risks associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related matters of its underlying investments.  The HKMA supports responsible investment by integrating ESG factors into the investment processes for both public and private market investments of the Exchange Fund, underpinned by the guiding principle that priority will generally be given to ESG investments if the long-term risk-adjusted return is comparable with other investments.  For more details about the HKMA’s responsible investment framework and implementation, see the Sustainability chapter on pages 184 to 191.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2021\n\nGlobal equity markets rose sharply and hit new record highs on the back of ultra-loose monetary policies and fiscal measures, driving an accelerated recovery of the global economy and financial markets.  However, Hong Kong and Mainland equity markets underperformed amid market reforms.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the US rose by 27%, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 14%.\n\nFor the bond markets, rising inflation expectations and tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a rise in US Treasury yields and falling bond prices during 2021.  Ten-year US Treasury yields increased by about 60 basis points from 0.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.5% at the end of the year.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against other major currencies, particularly towards the end of 2021, on the back of expectations about the Fed’s tapering pace. In particular, the euro and the yen depreciated by 7.1% and 10.3% against the US dollar respectively.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2021 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$191.9 billion in 2021.  This comprised gains on bonds of HK$12.6 billion, net gains on equities of HK$47.8 billion (with gains of HK$68.8 billion from foreign equities, and losses of HK$21.0 billion from Hong Kong equities), a positive currency translation effect of HK$16.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$114.7 billion on other investments held by the investment-holding subsidiaries of the Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$3.1 billion.\n\nTotal assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,570.2 billion at the end of the year.  The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$515.3 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$392.5 billion and real estate HK$122.8 billion.  Outstanding investment commitments of the LTGP amounted to HK$225.7 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund in 2021, excluding the Strategic Portfolio, was 4.1%.  Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 3.7%, while the BP gained 0.4%.  The LTGP has recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 15.4% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual returns of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2021 are set out in Chart 1.  Table 2 shows the 2021 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons.  The average return was 5.3% during 2019–2021, 4.7% during 2017–2021, 3.3% during 2012–2021 and 4.8% since 1994.  Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund’s assets on 31 December 2021.\n\nSee pages 211 to 319 for the audited 2021 financial statements of the Exchange Fund.\n","zh":"# 儲備管理\n\n二零二一年，全球金融市場展開了復甦之路。儘管全球經濟持續受到不斷演變的 COVID-19 疫情影響，但包括疫苗接種率上升、各國寬鬆的貨幣政策和財政措施等因素，共同促成了全球經濟和金融市場的顯著復甦。在此背景下，多個海外股票市場在當年創下歷史新高，而投資基金的整體股票投資組合亦能取得理想回報，儘管香港股票表現不佳。二零二一年，投資基金錄得投資收益一千九百一十九億港元，投資回報率為百分之四點一。\n\n# 基金會\n\n據《金融管理局條例》規定，金融管理局的主要目標是直接或間接影響香港的貨幣匯率。 基金亦可被用作維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定及健全，以協助維護香港作為國際金融中心的地位。 金融管理局在財政司長的授權下，並於授權範圍內，對金融管理局的運用及投資管理負責。\n\n# 投資基金之管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會（聯匯諮詢委員會）已為聯匯基金訂定了以下投資目標：\n\n(i) 保持本金；\n(ii) 確保貨幣基礎全盤以高流動性美元計息資產充抵，並隨時維持足額備抵；\n(iii) 確保有足夠的流動性，以維持貨幣及金融穩定；及\n(iv) 於(i)-(iii)項的前提下，達致有助於維護投資基金長期購買力的投資回報。\n\n這些目標完全顧及投資基金的法定職能，並已納入基金的投資組合架構及目標資產配置中（見圖1）。\n\n圖一 聯匯基金投資組合劃分\n\n廣泛來說，外匯基金擁有兩個主要投資組合：支持性投資組合（BP）和投資組合（IP）。支持性投資組合以高度流動性的美元計價資產為主要持有物，以應付貨幣牌照安排所需，為貨幣基礎提供全額支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場，旨在維護其資產的價值和長期購買力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升中長期回報，香港金管局會以審慎及循序漸進的方式，將部分投資基金的投資分散至更廣泛的資產類別。當中包括新興市場及內地債券及股本，私募股本（包括基礎建設）及房地產。新興市場及內地債券及股本由投資工具組合（IP）持有，而私募股本及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。自成立以來，金管局已制定上限以指導LTGP的投資分散步伐。隨著LTGP的投資規模及資產多元化日益成熟，投資基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）於2022年1月決定，將上限改為與其他資產類別同步釐定的資產配置目標，並在審慎風險管理原則下執行。\n\n策略投資組合於二零零七年創立，持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，此股份乃由政府為策略目的，代表投資基金收購所得。由於其獨特性，策略投資組合不納入評估基金投資表現的指標之中。\n\n# 聯匯基金的投資部署\n\n時時金匯基金會不時接受財政儲備、政府基金及法定機構的存款。利率通常與IP2的表現掛鈎，但未來基金3除外，其利率則根據投資組合配置，與IP及長期政府債券投資組合（LTGP）的回報掛鈎。 截至2021年，未來基金的投資組合配置在IP與LTGP之間約為40:60。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n聯匯基金的投資過程以兩種資產配置的決策為基礎：策略性資產配置和戰術性資產配置。策略性資產配置反映在投資標竿中，代表著聯匯基金的投資目標所決定的長期資產配置。在策略性配置的指導下，資產會以戰術方式配置，試圖在標竿之上取得超額回報。這意味著實際配置通常與標竿（或策略性）配置有所不同。實際配置與標竿配置之間的差異被稱為「戰術性偏差」。雖然標竿和追蹤誤差上限由財政司長諮詢聯匯基金監察委員會（EFAC）後決定，戰術性決策以及戰術性偏差的可接受範圍則由香港金管局在授權下制定和設定。在戰術性偏差允許的範圍內，投資組合經理可以建立 позиции，以利用短期的市場波動（見圖2）。\n\n圖2 投資基金資產配置\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金管局的投資基金投資處負責投資及相關風險管理職能。投資基金投資處的職員直接管理投資基金約71%的投資，包括全部指定銀行存款及部分投資組合。此部分投資組合包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的資產組合，以及一系列實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合，以服務基金。\n\n# 外聘管理人員的使用\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金管局還聘用外部基金經理管理約佔投資基金約29%的資產，包括所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產類別。聘用外部經理的目的是利用市場上最佳的投資專業知識，以實現可持續的回報，發揮多元且互補的投資策略，並獲取投資方面的市場洞察力和專業技術。\n\n聘用外部管理人所產生的支出，包括基金管理費、保管機構費用、交易成本，以及預扣稅款及其他稅費。此項支出主要由市場因素決定，並可能逐年變動。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n投資環境日益複雜，突顯了風險管理的重要性。香港金管局為內部及外部管理的投資組合，都制定了嚴格的監控措施和投資指引，並確保已建立完善的風險監察及合規系統。為有效實施風險管理及投資相關活動的治理，已建立三道防線。關鍵風險類別（包括信貸風險、市場風險、流動性風險及營運風險）會定期監察，而風險管理流程提供了一個穩健的框架，以支持策略規劃和投資多元化。\n\n# 責任投資\n\n金管局認為，透過著重負責任投資及可持續的長期經濟表現，有助於更好地實現投資基金的投資目標，並降低與其基礎投資的環境、社會及管治（ESG）相關風險。金管局支持負責任投資，將ESG因素融入投資基金公共市場及私人市場投資的投資流程，其指導原則是，若風險調整後的長期回報與其他投資相若，一般會優先考慮ESG投資。有關金管局負責任投資框架及落實的更多詳情，請參閱第184至191頁的「可持續發展」章節。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n\n# 2021年金融市場\n\n在全球股市受到寬鬆貨幣政策和財政措施的推動下，大幅上漲並創下新紀錄高點，推動全球經濟和金融市場加速復甦。然而，香港和中國內地股市表現不佳，原因在於市場改革。美國標準普爾500指數上漲了27%，而香港恆生指數則下跌了14%。\n\n對於債券市場而言，2021 年，通膨預期上升以及美國聯準會（Fed）縮減資產收購，導致美國國庫券殖利率上升，債券價格下跌。 十年期美國國庫券殖利率從年初的 0.9% 上升至年底的 1.5%，增長約 60 依點（basis points）。\n\n在外匯市場上，美元兌其他主要貨幣走強，尤其是在2021年末，主要受到對聯準會縮減購幣規模速度的預期所影響。其中，歐元和日圓對美元分別貶值了7.1%和10.3%。\n\n表一顯示了2021年主要貨幣、債券和股票市場的表現。\n\n# 投資基金表現\n\n聯邦投資有限公司於二零二一年錄得投資收益一千九百一十九億港元。其中包括債券收益十二點六億港元，股本淨收益四十七點八億港元（其中外地股本收益六十八點八億港元，而香港股本虧損二十一點零億港元），非港元資產的匯兌收益十六點八億港元，以及基金投資控股附屬機構持有的其他投資所得收益一千一十四點七億港元。 另外，策略投資組合錄得公平值收益三點一億港元。\n\n年結時，外匯基金總資產達至4,570.2億港元。 根據長期投資計劃（LTGP）的投資總值為515.3億港元，其中私募股權佔392.5億港元，而房地產則佔122.8億港元。 該長期投資計劃的未履行投資承諾總額為225.7億港元。\n\n聯邦投資局2021年的投資回報（不包括策略投資組合）為4.1%。其中，知識產權投資組合（IP）的回報率為3.7%，而商業投資組合（BP）則增長0.4%。自2009年成立以來，長期投資組合（LTGP）的年化內部報酬率為15.4%。\n\n圖一列出了自一九九四年至二零二一年外匯基金的年度回報。表二顯示了二零二一年的投資回報以及基金在不同時間段的平均投資回報。二零一九年至二零二一年期間的平均回報為百分之五點三，二零一七年至二零二一年期間為百分之四點七，二零一二年至二零二一年期間為百分之三點三，自一九九四年以來則為百分之四點八。表三顯示了截至二零二一年十二月三十一日，基金資產的貨幣構成。\n\n請參閱第211至319頁，以了解聯匯基金已審核的2021年度財務報表。\n"}

By end-2021, the HKMA had opened up 148 sets of Open APIs on its website, in line with the targeted schedule.\n\n# Information Centre\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre, located on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre, is an important facility introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters.  It consists of an exhibition area and a library. The exhibition area presents an overview of the HKMA’s work and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong in an interactive manner.  It also contains information and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.  The library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 26,000 books, journals and other publications on Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs as well as central banking topics.  It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices, as well as the register of securities staff of AIs, for public access as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nTo safeguard public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, special operational arrangements were put in place at the Information Centre.  Cleansing and disinfection were stepped up, and facilities and exhibits were sanitised regularly with anti-microbial coating.\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre’s exhibition area comprises the Policy Section, the Currency Section and the Historical Timeline\n\n# Community engagement and public education\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, a public education programme has been running since 1998.  In 2021, a webinar was organised for over 2,300 students and teachers from 84 secondary schools.  The webinar covered an overview of the HKMA’s work, the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, protection of personal digital keys, the Deposit Protection Scheme and career opportunities in the banking industry.  To date, more than 63,000 people have participated in the public education programme.\n\nThe HKMA educates and engages the public on how to be smart and responsible financial consumers.  In view of the increase in phishing scams, the HKMA conducted a public awareness campaign themed “Protect your Personal Digital Keys; Beware of Fraudulent Links!” with cross-media promotion to urge the public to stay vigilant against fraudulent hyperlinks embedded in SMS messages and emails purportedly from banks.\n\nCross-media promotion reminding the public to beware of fraudulent hyperlinks\n\nThe HKMA also seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of the financial industry and raise the young generation’s interest in pursuing a career in the industry.  Following positive feedback to the online drama series “STEPS” in 2020, the HKMA launched a new series titled “Four Faces of Talents in Central” featuring four growing areas of the financial industry: data science, fintech, green and sustainable finance, and wealth management.  In the video series, the characters of the market practitioners were portrayed in a humorous manner, and seasoned industry players and young talents shared first-hand information on the nature and requirements of jobs, career opportunities and prospects across the above four growing areas.\n\n“Four Faces of Talents in Central” series keeps the young generation abreast of career opportunities in the financial market\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” launched in 2020 was recognised with a Silver Award in the “Best Event — Corporate Social Responsibility” category of the MarketingInteractive’s Marketing Events Awards 2021.  Building on the campaign’s success and to sustain momentum, the HKMA rolled out additional initiatives, including a parenting financial education workshop where child education experts shared tips on how to teach kids good money sense and demonstrated a DIY (do-it-yourself) financial educational toy, as well as an animated virtual tour of the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nThe “Online Parenting and Educational Campaign” wins an award at the Marketing Events Awards 2021.  The campaign promotes money management concept and skills to let parents and kids learn in an amusing and entertaining way.\n\nTo enhance financial literacy among secondary school students, the HKMA and various stakeholders co-organised the “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship”, which featured a fintech theme.  Apart from an online quiz, a new financial design thinking workshop on personal financial management was added to train the participating students to develop innovative proposals on money management tools.  This initiative won the “Highest Student Participation Award” offered by the Business-School Partnership Programme under the Education Bureau, and the “Investor and Financial Education Award (Corporate) — Gold Award” offered by the Investor and Financial Education Council2 (IFEC).\n\nThe “Hong Kong Financial Literacy Championship” educates students on fintech and design thinking concepts and achieves record-high participation\n\nOther community engagement initiatives included talks or webinars for students and retirees.  The HKMA also participated in a teacher training webinar on economic security organised by the Education Bureau.  Online educational materials offering smart tips on using automated teller machines (ATMs) are available in eight languages3 to cater for people of different backgrounds living in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA supports the IFEC in promoting financial literacy and capacity in Hong Kong, and will explore further collaboration with stakeholders to maximise the impact of community engagement.\n\n# Financial disclosure\n\nTo maintain a high level of transparency, the HKMA adopts international standards in financial disclosure insofar as these are applicable to central banking operations.  These include the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and other applicable reporting requirements, for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.  The Finance Division works with external auditors and other accounting professionals to prepare and present the Exchange Fund’s financial statements in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.  The HKMA also provides detailed disclosures and thorough analyses of a wide range of expense items and budgetary information in its Annual Report.\n\n# ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS\n\n# Risk management\n\nOne of the HKMA’s most important tasks is to manage risks to the monetary and banking systems.  Risk management is undertaken both at a working level in the day-to-day operations and at a higher level through strategic planning. Under the HKMA’s risk management framework, there are two high-level committees — the Macro Surveillance Committee and the Risk Committee — both of which are chaired by the Chief Executive of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Macro Surveillance Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the monetary and financial system in Hong Kong and discuss possible measures to address such risks;\n- to review existing measures for managing risks in the monetary and financial system to identify possible gaps and ensure the adequacy of these measures; and\n- to encourage cross-departmental sharing of relevant information on macro surveillance with a view to enhancing the macro surveillance capability of the HKMA.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Risk Committee are:\n\n- to identify potential risks and threats to the organisation and devise strategies to reduce the impact of such events;\n- to review the existing system for managing risks across different departments to identify possible gaps and significant risks and ensure the adequacy of measures to address them;\n- to harmonise the criteria and methods of risk measurement and prioritise the resources management of risks identified; and\n- to encourage a stronger risk management culture institutionally which promotes the proper levels of authorisation and controls.\n\nA robust operational risk management framework is in place covering organisational risks at two levels: the entity level and the department level.  Entity-level risks refer mainly to those which concern the entire organisation in the medium term, or which might call for a cross-departmental response. Potential and emerging risks identified by business units, and the adequacy of the control measures and mitigating strategies they devise, are reviewed and reported every quarter.  This is supplemented by a top-down approach to manage entity-level risks, in which senior colleagues heading different business units actively identify risks of wider impact and propose mitigating measures.  The Risk Committee discusses these assessments and decides on appropriate follow-up actions.\n","zh":"# 企業職能\n\n公司支援職能為香港金管局的運作提供保障，並以高度的透明度、問責制、效率和專業精神為之。為方便公眾了解其政策及運作，香港金管局透過傳統及社交媒體、其網站、資訊中心及其他渠道，與社會和市場保持有效的溝通。在機構內部，香港金管局致力構建立一支靈活且可持續的團隊，實施嚴謹的財務紀律，並提升資訊科技能力，以適應變遷，確保其政策和倡議的有效執行。\n\n# 透明度\n\n# 媒體關係與社交媒體\n\n金管局與傳媒緊密合作，以提升透明度，並促進公眾對其政策及營運的理解。 於二零二一年，金管局舉行或參與了共169項實體及虛擬活動，包括八場新聞發佈會、八次即席訪問及153項其他公開活動。 另外，安排了27次媒體專訪。 整個年度共發佈了632份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n為提高對香港金融管理局主要職能的認識，我們為本地、內地及外地傳媒舉辦了新聞發佈會及簡報會。 議題包括「互聯互通」機制、金融科技（Fintech）以及利率指標改革。\n\n為及時與公眾溝通互動，香港金融管理局維持五個社交媒體平台（Facebook、Instagram、LinkedIn、Twitter及YouTube），擁有超過八萬名關注者。 金融管理局利用這些社交媒體平台，提高公眾對各項議題的關注，尤其是在疫情期間顯著增加的網絡釣魚騙案。 此外，亦透過社交媒體進行了廣泛的綠色金融、金融科技及「連通」計劃的宣傳活動，讓公眾隨時掌握最新的發展趨勢。\n\n香港金管局首席行政員於江謹慎先生主持了2021年香港金融科技週的虛擬論壇。\n\n香港金管局副行政總裁李 Howard 先生，將會主持一場關於金管局「金融科技 2025」策略的記者會。\n\n香港金管局副行政總裁溫志強先生，將會舉行一場記者會，介紹香港銀行業為應對倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）過渡所做的準備。\n\n香港金管局副行政總裁劉健先生接受一間國際新聞台專訪。\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公共查詢服務為公眾更深入了解金管局的主要職能和運作提供了一個有效途徑。 於二零二一年，該服務處理了九千七百八十一宗查詢。 其中約一半與銀行政策及法規、消費銀行問題、紙幣硬幣，以及金融基礎設施和債務市場發展相關。 一些值得注意的查詢包括有關金幣換領計劃、銀行產品及服務、與銀行相關的指引及通函，以及零售債券發行計劃。\n\n圖一顯示自2018年以來所收到的公共諮詢數量，圖二則提供了2021年按諮詢性質劃分的詳細分類。\n\n圖一 公共諮詢總數\n\n圖表 2 2021 年收到的諮詢性質\n\n# 出版物\n\n除了香港金管局年度報告外，金管局還發布了兩期《半年貨幣及金融穩定局勢報告》及四期《季刊》，並定期更新《月度統計通報》，以提供香港貨幣、銀行及經濟議題的最新及主題性資訊及分析。金管局同時亦發布了11期《inSight1》文章，介紹其主要的新舉措及政策，並討論香港關注的時事議題。\n\n香港金管局二零二零年年報，於香港管理專業人員協會二零二一年最佳年報頒獎禮上，榮獲「非牟利及慈善機構」組別的銀獎，以及環境、社會及管治報告組別的卓越獎。\n\n# 公司網站\n\n香港金管局網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供超過四萬四千頁的內容，分別以英文、繁體中文及簡體中文呈現，為公眾獲取香港金管局最新資訊的主要途徑。網站載有受認可金融機構（Authorized Institutions，AIs）及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及根據《銀行條例》第20條維護的受認可金融機構證券人員登記冊，還包括根據《支付系統及儲值易介數發牌條例》而維護的儲值易介數發牌機構登記冊。\n\n自二〇一八年起，香港金融管理局已分階段在其網站上透過開放應用程式介面（API）發布金融數據及重要資訊。截至二〇二一年底，香港金融管理局已在其網站上開放了148組開放API，並按原定進度完成。\n\n# 資訊中心\n\n香港金管局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是一個向社會大眾介紹金管局工作、宣揚貨幣及銀行事務的重要設施。中心設有展覽區及圖書館。展覽區以互動方式呈現金管局的工作概要，以及香港的貨幣及銀行發展歷程，並提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的資訊及展品供公眾學習。圖書館則位於展覽區旁，收藏超過二萬六千本關於香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務，以及中央銀行相關主題的書籍、期刊及其他出版物。此外，圖書館亦遵照《銀行條例》第20條規定，供公眾查閱獲授權機構及本地代表辦事處的登記冊，以及獲授權機構的證券從業員登記冊。\n\n為保障疫情期間公眾的健康及安全，資訊中心已實施特別的營運安排。清潔消毒工作已加強，設施及展覽亦會定期使用抗菌塗層進行消毒。\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心之展覽區包括政策組、貨幣組及歷史時間軸。\n\n# 社區參與與公眾教育\n\n為向社會宣傳及提高公眾對香港金融管理局工作之認識，一項公眾教育項目自一九九八年起持續推出。於二零二一年，該局為超過二千三百名來自八十四間中學的學生及教師舉辦了一場網絡研討會。研討會涵蓋了香港金融管理局的工作概要、聯繫匯率制度、香港鈔票、個人數字密匙的保護、存款保障計劃以及銀行業的職業發展機會。截至目前，已有超過六萬三千人參與了這項公眾教育項目。\n\n金管局致力教育市民，成為精明及負責任的金融消費者。 鑑於網絡釣魚騙案日益增加，金管局展開一項以「保護您的個人數碼密匙，小心詐騙連結！」為主題的公眾教育宣傳活動，並透過多媒體平台進行推廣，呼籲市民時刻警惕，提防以銀行名義發出的短訊及電郵中嵌入的詐騙連結。\n\n跨媒體宣傳，提醒公眾警惕詐騙連結。\n\n金管局亦致力加強公眾對金融業的了解，並提升年輕一代對從事金融行業的興趣。 繼2020年網上電視劇《STEPS》取得良好回響後，金管局推出新一輯名為《中環人才四面睇》的劇集，介紹金融業的四大增長領域：數據科學、金融科技、綠色及可持續金融，以及財富管理。 該劇集以幽默的方式刻劃了市場從業者的角色，並邀請資深業界人士及年輕人才分享在上述四大增長領域的工作性質、要求、職位機會及前景的實情。\n\n「中央人才四面特輯」系列讓年輕世代掌握金融市場的職涯機會。\n\n二零二零年推出的「網上親子教育活動」於二零二一年的《市場互動》市場活動大獎中，榮獲「最佳活動—企業社會責任」類別的銀獎。為延續活動的成功及保持動力，香港市場營銷公會進一步推出多項活動，包括一場親子財務教育工作坊，邀請兒童教育專家分享如何向孩子培養正確的金錢觀念，並示範一款DIY財務教育玩具，以及一場香港市場營銷公會資訊中心的虛擬動畫導賞。\n\n「線上育兒教育活動」於2021年行銷活動大獎中獲得殊榮。此活動旨在以趣味和娛樂的方式，向家長和孩子們推廣理財觀念和技能。\n\n為提升中學生區金融知識，香港金融管理局及各持份者合辦「香港金融知識錦標賽」，主題為金融科技。除了網上測試外，新增了一個個人財務管理財務設計思維工作坊，旨在培訓參與學生，讓他們能構思創新的理財工具方案。此項倡議獲得了教育局「商界與學界合作夥伴計劃」頒發的「最高學生參與獎」，以及投資者及金融教育諮詢委員會（IFEC）頒發的「投資者及金融教育獎（企業）——金獎」。\n\n「香港金融知識錦標賽」向學生普及金融科技及設計思考的概念，並創下歷來最高參與人數。\n\n其他社區參與活動包括為學生和退休人士舉辦講座或網絡研討會。 金融管理局亦參與了教育局舉辦的關於經濟安全的教師培訓網絡研討會。 提供智能提示，教導如何使用自動櫃員機（ATM）的線上教育資源，有八種語言版本，以滿足居住在香港的不同背景人士的需求。\n\n金管局一向支持香港金融教育基金會，致力推廣香港的金融知識及能力，並將會與各持份者進一步探討合作，以 максимально 提升社區參與的成效。\n\n# 財務披露\n\n為維持高透明度，香港金管局在財務披露方面，盡可能採納國際標準，以適用於中央銀行營運的情況。這些標準包括香港財務匯報準則及其他適用性的報告要求，例如國際貨幣基金組織的特別資料發布標準。財務部與外部審計師及其他會計專業人士合作，根據香港財務匯報準則編製及呈列投資基金的財務報表。香港金管局亦在其年度報告中提供詳盡的披露及對大量開支項目和預算信息的全面分析。\n\n# 責任與管制\n\n# 風險管理\n\n香港金管局最重要的職責之一是管理對貨幣及銀行系統構成的風險。風險管理的工作在日常運作中以操作層面進行，同時亦透過策略規劃在高層次上實施。根據香港金管局的風險管理架構，設有兩個高層次的委員會，分別是宏觀監察委員會及風險管理委員會，兩會均由香港金管局總裁主持。\n\n宏觀監察委員會的職權範圍如下：\n\n- 識別香港貨幣及金融系統潛在的風險及威脅，並討論應對這些風險的可能措施；\n- 審閱現有的貨幣及金融系統風險管理措施，以識別可能存在的不足之處，並確保這些措施的充分性；及\n- 鼓勵各部門就宏觀監察相關資訊進行交流，藉此提升金管局的宏觀監察能力。\n\n風險委員會的職權範圍如下：\n\n- 識別組織潛在的風險與威脅，並制定策略以降低此類事件的影響；\n- 審查各部門現有的風險管理體系，以找出可能存在的漏洞和重大風險，並確保應對措施的充分性；\n- 調和風險評估的標準和方法，並優先管理已識別風險的資源；以及\n- 鼓勵組織內建立更強的風險管理文化，促進適當的授權和控制。\n\n已建立健全的營運風險管理框架，涵蓋組織層面的風險，分為兩個層次：實體層次和部門層次。實體層次的風險主要指那些關乎整個組織的中長期風險，或可能需要跨部門協作的回應。各業務部門識別出的潛在和新興風險，以及其制定的控制措施和緩解策略的充分性，將每季進行審查和報告。此舉輔以自上而下的方式來管理實體層次的風險，由各業務部門負責的資深同事主動識別具有更廣泛影響的風險，並提出緩解措施。風險委員會將討論這些評估結果，並決定適當的後續行動。\n"}
{"en":"# Sustainability\n\nThe HKMA is publishing its first sustainability report, as an integral part of its Annual Report 2021, to set out its strategy on sustainability and document its own efforts, as well as its joint efforts with the financial industry, to support the Government’s climate strategies and contribute to a more climate resilient and sustainable world.\n\nThe HKMA embeds sustainability considerations across its main roles and functions, whether as a banking supervisor, a market facilitator, a responsible investor, or in maintaining financial and monetary stability.  Moreover, the HKMA collaborates with local and overseas counterparts in strengthening the management and disclosures of climate risks, as well as the development of the green and sustainable finance market.\n\nIn addition, the HKMA is committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and aims to be a responsible and sustainable organisation. This commitment is manifested in various areas, including promoting a sustainable, financially inclusive and environmentally friendly marketplace, supporting the wider community, protecting the environment and nurturing a caring workplace.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.  To combat climate change, countries agreed, under the Paris Agreement1, to take actions to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and eventually achieve carbon neutrality within this century.  Meeting the Paris Agreement climate change target will require investments of an estimated US$1–2 trillion a year globally2, making sustainability one of the biggest drivers of capital flows in the decades ahead.\n\nHong Kong is determined to be at the forefront of this transition.  The Government announced that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in line with developed economies globally.  Hong Kong is also the first Asian jurisdiction that has committed to specifically aligning disclosure requirements with recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2025 across relevant sectors.\n\nTo the financial sector, climate change is both a source of risk and opportunity.  While the financial sector cannot be spared from the threats posed by climate change, it has a key role to play in the transition by channelling more financing to activities that are consistent with a pathway towards lower GHG emissions and climate-resilient developments.\n\nThe HKMA is committed to strengthening Hong Kong’s financial system to support a greener and more sustainable future, driving actions to support the Government’s climate goal and contributing to the global agenda.  In doing so, the HKMA incorporates sustainability considerations in carrying out its main functions and in running its operations.\n\nFirst, as a banking supervisor, the HKMA aims to strengthen resilience of the banking system against climate risks and to accelerate banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  To accomplish this, the HKMA has formulated a regulatory framework setting out supervisory requirements for banks to manage and disclose climate risks.  A pilot exercise on climate risk stress test to assess the resilience of the banking sector was also concluded successfully in 2021.  Meanwhile, on an ongoing basis, the HKMA takes into account climate change in monitoring financial stability risks.\n\nSecondly, in its market development role, the HKMA is focusing its efforts in enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, including the Greater Bay Area (GBA).  Hong Kong, being Mainland’s offshore financial centre, is well-positioned to channel global investments into Mainland’s plans to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  The HKMA is also working through the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (CASG)3, which the HKMA co-chairs, to build industry capacity, address data gaps and explore the development of a local green classification framework.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is a leader in green finance solutions, having established the world’s first government Global Medium Term Note Programme dedicated to green bond issuances under the Government Green Bond Programme, and increased gradually the diversity of its issuances since 2019, both in terms of currencies and tenors.  To support the issuance of green and sustainable bonds and loans in the private sector, the Government set up the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May 2021. Administered by the HKMA, this scheme has incentivised more corporates to seek green and sustainable financing in Hong Kong, and encouraged more green advisers and external reviewers to establish or expand their presence here.\n\nThirdly, as the manager of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has ensured that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are an integral part of its investment process and asset allocation decisions.  In the latter part of this report, the HKMA makes its inaugural disclosures on its climate scenario analysis and carbon footprint metrics of the Exchange Fund’s portfolios.\n\nFourthly, the HKMA is stepping up its own green office initiatives to ensure its own operations conform to best practices in the management and mitigation of climate risks.  As a start, the HKMA has established its carbon profile across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions4, and made corresponding disclosures.  At the same time, the HKMA has implemented measures to enhance industry-wide operational efficiency and minimise resource consumption.  In addition, the HKMA holds itself to high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and works with its stakeholders to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy.\n\nGreening the financial system requires close collaboration amongst central banks and supervisors.  The HKMA is an active member of the international community in global policymaking and alignment of sustainability standards. The HKMA has also issued a statement to support the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Glasgow Declaration5, reaffirming its commitment to delivering on the NGFS recommendations in taking the necessary measures to foster a greener financial system.\n\nIn driving these sustainability initiatives and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks, sustainability and green considerations are embedded in the HKMA’s governance and risk management frameworks, in which the leadership is actively involved in setting the overarching objectives and guiding principles, in consultation with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and its sub-committees. The HKMA’s CSR and Sustainability Committee (CSC) also assesses the potential impacts of sustainability and climate-related issues on the organisation, and devises strategies to reduce the impacts.  Execution of the relevant strategies and initiatives is closely monitored and reported to the top management regularly.  In addition, external consultants have been engaged to advise the HKMA in selected areas of work.\n\nThe subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the HKMA’s governance, strategies and risk management measures in undertaking green finance and sustainability work in each of its roles.\n\nThis report is prepared with reference to the disclosure elements recommended in the NGFS’s Guide on Climaterelated Disclosure for Central Banks, published in December 2021.  In addition, information in relation to the HKMA’s office operations makes broad reference to the reporting principles under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards6 and the ESG Reporting Guide promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\n# Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System\n\nThe NGFS provides a platform for central banks and prudential supervisory authorities to exchange experiences, share best practices, contribute to the development of environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable economy.  Its purpose is to define and promote best practices to be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS, and to conduct or commission analytical work on green finance.\n\n# Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nIn December 2015, the Financial Stability Board created the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures by companies to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters that could promote more informed decisions.  The TCFD’s recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n# BANKING SUPERVISOR\n\nAs the core part of the financial system, banks should be proactive in managing climate risks, and support channelling more capital to green and sustainable activities.  As a banking supervisor, the HKMA focuses on building banks’ resilience against climate risks and accelerating banks’ efforts in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n# Overview of the HKMA’s three-phased approach\n\nSince May 2019, the HKMA has been promoting green and sustainable banking in three phases:\n\n# Phase I\n\nDeveloping a common framework to assess the “greenness baseline” of individual banks, and collaborating with international bodies to provide technical support to banks in Hong Kong.\n\n# Phase II\n\nConsulting the industry and other stakeholders on the supervisory expectations and requirements of green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Phase III\n\nFocusing on the implementation of supervisory requirements, monitoring and evaluation of banks’ progress in green and sustainable banking.\n\n# Guidance\n\n# Supervisory requirements on climate risk management\n\nIn 2020, the HKMA developed a common framework for assessing the “greenness baseline” of individual banks in collaboration with the industry.  The HKMA also conducted the first greenness assessment of banks, which marked the completion of Phase I.  To help banks prepare for the new supervisory requirements, a white paper was published in June 2020, which outlined the HKMA’s initial thinking on supervisory expectations for climate risk management.\n\nIn December 2021, following an industry consultation, the HKMA issued the supervisory requirements for banks to incorporate climate considerations into governance, strategy, risk management and disclosure.  In particular, specific requirements and concrete timeline were set out in mandating climate-related disclosures based on the recommendations of the TCFD before 2025. The requirements will set a benchmark to help banks upgrade their risk management capability.\n\nThe next step is for the HKMA to monitor banks’ implementation of the relevant requirements.  In this regard, the HKMA has stepped up its supervisory capacity by setting up a new dedicated team within its Banking Supervision Department to carry out climate risk supervision.\n\nThis three-phased approach is an iterative and evolving process.  Further to the first round of greenness assessment conducted in 2020, the HKMA is reviewing the framework to encompass the new supervisory requirements on climate risk management and potentially cover a wider scope, such as other environmental risks and measures for supporting the net zero transition.   The HKMA intends to launch an updated framework in the second half of 2022.\n\n# Sound practices supporting the transition to carbon neutrality\n\nApart from incorporating climate risk considerations into the risk management framework, some banks have devoted resources and taken measures to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and contribute to achieving global net zero emissions.  The HKMA issued a circular in December 2021 to share with the industry the sound practices of these banks which would be of reference value to other banks in the industry in formulating their climate strategies.  These sound practices are grouped into four areas: reducing GHG emissions of the banks’ own operations, reducing financed emissions through portfolio alignment, assisting clients to transition, and promoting collective efforts to assist the economy to achieve a net-zero transition.\n\n# Green classification framework to facilitate green finance flows\n\nTo increase transparency across the financial markets and enable consistent policy making on green finance, the HKMA has been working with other financial regulators to explore a local green classification framework, which will facilitate navigation among the Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) developed by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF)8 and the green definitions adopted by China and European Union, for adoption across different financial sectors.  The work will be guided by the principles of interoperability, comparability and inclusiveness, taking into account other definitions of green, transitional activities and local considerations.  This initiative will reduce the risk of green washing, improve product comparability and ultimately enhance investor protection.\n\n# Assessment: climate risk stress test\n\nTo assess the banking sector’s ability to cope with potential shocks brought about by climate change, the HKMA undertook a pilot exercise on climate risk stress test (CRST), which included the participation of 20 major retail banks and seven branches of international banking groups.  A report summarising the results of the pilot CRST exercise was published in December 2021.  The results showed that the banking sector remained resilient even in the face of extreme climate-related shocks, although these shocks could potentially give rise to significant adverse impacts on banks’ financials.  The CRST exercise helped to enhance banks’ capabilities for measuring and assessing climate risks. In light of the CRST results, the participating banks have devised plans to strengthen their climate strategies and risk governance frameworks.  The HKMA will continue to engage the industry to strengthen banks’ capability and enhance the CRST framework, taking into account the lessons learnt from the pilot exercise.\n","zh":"# 可持續發展\n\n金管局現正於其《2021年度年報》中刊發首份可持續發展報告，旨在闡述其在可持續發展方面的策略，並記錄其自身的工作，以及與金融業界共同努力，以支持政府的氣候策略，為構建更具韌性及可持續的地球貢獻力量。\n\n香港金管局將可持續發展的考慮融入其主要職能和範疇，無論是以銀行監管、市場促進者、負責任的投資者，還是維持金融及貨幣穩定為目標。此外，金管局亦與本地及海外同業合作，加強對氣候風險的管理與披露，以及發展綠色及可持續金融市場。\n\n此外，香港金管局亦致力履行其企業社會責任，並力求成為一個負責任且可持續的機構。 這種承諾體現在多個方面，包括促進可持續、金融普惠和環境友善的市場，支持更廣泛的社會，保護環境以及營造關懷備至的工作場所。\n\n# 總覽\n\n氣候變化是當今世界面臨的最嚴峻挑戰之一。為應對氣候變化，各國在《巴黎協定》下達成共識，承諾採取行動減少溫室氣體排放，並在本世紀實現碳中和。 達成《巴黎協定》的氣候變化目標，預計需要全球每年投入 1 到 2 萬億美元的資金，這將使永續發展成為未來幾十年裡資本流動的主要驅動力。\n\n香港決心於此轉型中處於領先地位。政府宣布，將力爭於2050年前實現碳中和，以配合全球發達經濟體。香港同時也是首個承諾於2025年前，在相關行業中，將資訊披露要求與氣候相關財務資訊揭露工作小組（TCFD）的建議具體對齊的亞洲地區管轄範疇。\n\n對金融界而言，氣候變化既是風險也是機會。儘管金融界無法倖免於氣候變化帶來的威脅，但它在轉型過程中扮演著關鍵角色，透過將更多資金導向與降低溫室氣體排放及具備氣候韌性的發展相符的活動。\n\n金管局致力加強香港的金融體系，以支持更環保和可持續的未來，並推動行動以支持政府的氣候目標，為全球議程做出貢獻。為達此目的，金管局在履行其主要職能和日常運作時，都會納入可持續發展的考量。\n\n首先，作為銀行監管機構，香港金管局旨在加強銀行體系應對氣候風險的能力，並加速各銀行支持向低碳經濟轉型的步伐。為達此目的，金管局已制定監管框架，訂明銀行管理及披露氣候風險的監管要求。此外，於2021年已成功完成一項評估銀行體系韌性的氣候風險壓力測試試驗。同時，金管局持續將氣候變化納入監測金融穩定風險的考量之中。\n\n其次，在市場發展方面，香港金管局正著力提升香港作為區域內綠色和可持續融資中心的地位，包括大灣區。 作為內地的離岸金融中心，香港在引導全球投資以支持內地在2030年前實現碳達峰和2060年前實現碳中和的目標方面，具有得天獨厚的優勢。香港金管局同時亦透過金管局共同主持的綠色及可持續融資跨部門協調委員會（CASG）³，致力於提升業界能力、填補數據缺口，並探討發展本地綠色分類框架。\n\n事實上，香港在綠色金融解決方案方面處於領先地位，早在2019年便已推出全球首個政府發行的全球中期票據計劃，專門用於政府綠色債券計劃項下的綠色債券發行，並自此逐步增加了發行工具的多樣性，涵蓋不同貨幣和期限。為支持私營機構綠色及可持續債券和貸款的發行，政府於2021年5月設立了綠色及可持續金融資助計劃。此計劃由香港金融管理局管理，已鼓勵更多企業在香港尋求綠色及可持續融資，並促使更多綠色顧問及外部審核機構在此設立或擴展業務。\n\n第三，作為投資基金的總管理機構，香港金管局已確保環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素已融入其投資流程及資產配置決策之中。在本報告的後段，香港金管局將會首次披露投資基金的氣候情景分析及碳足跡指標。\n\n第四點，金管局正積極推動自身的綠色辦公室計劃，以確保其運作符合氣候風險管理和減緩的最佳實務。作為開端，金管局已確立其第一類和第二類排放的碳足跡，並相應地進行披露。同時，金管局亦已實施措施，提升業界的營運效率，並盡量減少資源消耗。此外，金管局堅持高度的企業社會責任（CSR）標準，並與各利益相關者合作，推廣金融普惠和金融知識普及。\n\n發展綠色金融需要各國中央銀行和監管機構緊密合作。香港金管局是國際社會積極參與者，在國際政策制定和可持續發展標準協調方面發揮作用。金管局已發布聲明，支持《綠色金融系統中央銀行和監管機構網絡》（NGFS）格拉斯哥宣言，重申其承諾，將採取必要措施，落實NGFS建議，以促進更綠色金融系統的發展。\n\n在推動可持續發展倡議，並評估與氣候相關的機遇和風險時，香港金管局已將可持續發展及綠色考慮融入其監管及風險管理框架之中。領導層積極參與訂定總體目標及指導原則，並諮詢投資基金審核委員會（EFAC）及其轄下委員會。香港金管局的企業社會責任及可持續發展委員會（CSC）亦會評估可持續發展及與氣候相關議題對組織的潛在影響，並制定策略以減輕這些影響。相關策略和倡議的執行情況會得到密切監察，並定期向高級管理層匯報。此外，金管局還聘請了外部顧問，就部分工作領域提供建議。\n\n本章後續各節將深入探討香港金管局在履行各項職能時，推動綠色金融及可持續發展工作的治理、策略和風險管理措施。\n\n本報告的編制，參考了國際永續金融研討會（NGFS）於2021年12月發布的《中央銀行氣候相關資訊揭露指南》中建議的揭露要素。此外，與香港金管局辦公室運作相關的資訊，廣泛參考了《全球報告倡議組織》（GRI）標準6及香港交易所頒佈的ESG報告指引。\n\n# 中央銀行及監管機構綠色金融網絡\n\nNGFS 提供了一個平台，讓中央銀行和審慎監管機構交流經驗、分享最佳實務、促進金融部門環境與氣候風險管理發展，並動員主流融資以支持邁向永續經濟的轉型。 其目的在於定義並推廣可在 NGFS 會員內部及外部實施的最佳實務，並進行或委託綠色金融分析研究。\n\n# 氣候相關財務揭露工作小組\n\n二零一五年十二月，金融穩定理事會設立氣候相關財務資訊揭露工作小組（TCFD），旨在為企業向投資者、貸款機構及保險承保人提供更有效的氣候相關資訊揭露建議，以促進更明智的決策。TCFD的建議構建於四個主題領域，這些領域代表了組織運營的核心要素：公司治理、策略、風險管理以及指標與目標。\n\n# 銀行主管\n\n作為金融體系的核心，銀行應積極應對氣候風險，並支持更多資金投入綠色和可持續活動。作為監管機構，香港金融管理局著重於提升銀行應對氣候風險的能力，並加速銀行支持邁向低碳經濟的努力。\n\n# 香港金管局三階段方案概述\n\n自二零一九年五月起，香港金管局已分三個階段推廣綠色及可持續的銀行業：\n\n# 第一階段\n\n建立共通的評估框架，以評估各銀行「綠色基線」水平，並與國際機構合作，向香港的銀行提供技術支援。\n\n# 第二階段\n\n就綠色和永續性銀行業的監管期望和要求，向業界及其他利益相關者徵詢意見。\n\n# 第三階段\n\n著重於監督要求的落實、監測和評估銀行在綠色及永續性金融方面的進展。\n\n# 指引\n\n# 監管對氣候風險管理的規定\n\n於二零二零年，香港金管局與業界合作，制定了一個評估各銀行「綠色基線」的通用框架。金管局同時亦進行了首次銀行綠色評估，標誌著第一階段的完成。為協助銀行為新的監察要求作準備，金管局於二零二零年六月發布了一份白皮書，闡述了金管局對氣候風險管理監察期望的初步構想。\n\n二零二一年十二月，香港金管局在諮詢業界後，發布了針對銀行將氣候因素納入公司治理、策略、風險管理及披露的監管要求。 尤其，為符合《氣候相關財務資訊披露建議》(TCFD) 的建議，訂定了具體要求及時間表，規定銀行在二零二五年之前必須進行氣候相關資訊披露。 這些要求將為銀行提升風險管理能力設定基準。\n\n接下來，香港金管局將會監察銀行對相關要求的落實情況。為此，金管局已加強其監管能力，在銀行監察部設立了一個新的專責團隊，以負責氣候風險監察工作。\n\n此三階段方案是一個反覆迭代且不斷演進的過程。 繼2020年進行的首次綠色評估後，金管局正檢討此框架，以涵蓋新的氣候風險管理監管要求，並可能擴大範圍，例如納入其他環境風險以及支持淨零轉型的措施。 金管局計劃於2022年下半年發布更新後的框架。\n\n# 邁向碳中和的良好實踐\n\n除了將氣候風險納入風險管理框架外，部分銀行已投入資源並採取措施，以支持《巴黎協定》的目標，並為實現全球淨零排放做出貢獻。香港金管局於2021年12月發布一項通函，與業界分享這些銀行的良好做法，供業界其他銀行制定氣候策略的參考。這些良好做法可歸納為四個方面：減少銀行自身運營的溫室氣體排放，透過投資組合調整減少融資排放，協助客戶轉型，以及促進集體努力，協助經濟實現淨零轉型。\n\n# 綠色分類框架以促進綠色資金流動\n\n為提高金融市場的透明度，並為綠色金融政策制定提供一致性基礎，香港金管局正與其他金融監管機構合作，探討本地綠色分類框架，以方便各金融部門採用國際可持續金融平台（IPSF）制定的《共同基礎分類法》（CGT），以及中國和歐盟所採納的綠色定義。此項工作將以互操作性、可比性及包容性原則為指導，並會考慮其他綠色定義、過渡性活動及本地實際情況。此舉旨在降低綠色洗滌的風險，提升產品的可比性，並最終增強投資者保護。\n\n# 氣候風險壓力測試\n\n為評估銀行體系應對氣候變化可能帶來的潛在衝擊的能力，香港金管局進行了一項氣候風險壓力測試（CRST）的試驗項目，參與者包括二十家主要零售銀行和七家國際銀行集團的分行。香港金管局於2021年12月發布了一份總結該試驗項目結果的報告。結果顯示，即使面對極端氣候相關的衝擊，銀行體系仍具韌性，但這些衝擊也可能對銀行財務狀況造成重大不利影響。這項CRST 試驗有助於提升銀行衡量和評估氣候風險的能力。 鑒於CRST的結果，參與銀行已制定計劃，以加強其氣候策略和風險監管框架。香港金管局將繼續與業界合作，提升銀行能力，並在考慮到試驗項目所汲取的經驗教訓的基礎上，完善CRST框架。\n"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit Exchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Audit Commission The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 217 to 319, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.5, 2.6 and 38.1 to the financial statements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had financial assets totalling HK$4,502,475 million and financial liabilities totalling HK$1,150,861 million valued at fair value.\n\nFor 89% of these financial assets and all these financial liabilities, their fair values were quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\n\nFor the remaining 11% of these financial assets, their fair values were estimated using valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data (Level 3 inputs).  Such financial assets totalled HK$517,316 million, including mainly unlisted investment funds.\n\nGiven the substantial amount and the estimations involved, valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value was a key audit matter.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining an understanding of the procedures, including relevant controls, for valuing different categories of financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- evaluating and testing the controls, including relevant application controls of the computer systems;\n- obtaining external confirmations on the valuation, existence, rights and obligations and completeness of the financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- where quoted market prices were used, verifying the prices to independent sources;\n- where valuation techniques with inputs based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions, and verifying the inputs to independent sources; and\n- where valuation techniques with inputs not based on observable market data were used, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Valuation of investment properties at fair value\n\nRefer to notes 2.11, 18 and 19 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group’s investment properties were stated at their fair values, totalling HK$27,089 million as at 31 December 2021. The Group also had interests in one associate and twenty one joint ventures totalling HK$45,172 million, whose principal activities were holding overseas investment properties.  The fair values of these investment properties, whether held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, were mainly determined based on valuations by independent professional valuers.  Such valuations involved significant judgments and estimates, including the valuation methodologies and the assumptions used.\n\nThe audit procedures on valuation of investment properties at fair value included:\n\n- obtaining and reviewing the valuation reports of investment properties held by the Group directly or by associate or joint ventures, and verifying that the fair values were based on the valuations stated in the valuation reports;\n- assessing the independence and qualifications of the valuers; and\n- evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions and inputs.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2021 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nJohn Chu Director of Audit\n","zh":"# 匯儲基金\n\n審核基金財務報表總監報告\n\n# 審計署\n香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 呈呈財政司長\n\n# 意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）載於第217至319頁的財務報表，該財務報表包括截至2021年12月31日聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及截至該日止年度的收入及支出表、全面收益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，其中包括重要會計政策概要。\n\n依我之見，截至2021年12月31日止，該基金及該集團的財務狀況，以及截至該日止年度的財務表現及現金流量，在香港會計師公會（「香港會計師公會」）頒佈的香港財務報告準則（「香港財務報告準則」）下，均有真實而公平的列報，並且已根據《交易基金條例》（第66章）第7節首長行政長官的指示妥為編製。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我已按照行政長官根據《金融管理局條例》第七條發出的指示，以及審計署的審計準則進行審計。根據該等準則，我的職責在我的報告中「審計師對審計財務報表的責任」一節中進一步闡述。我已按照該等準則保持獨立於本集團，並且已按照該等準則履行其他道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計憑證已足夠且適當，足以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 審核關鍵事項\n\n我認為，於截至2021年12月31日止年度，我對財務報表審計中，最具重要性的事項，即為關鍵審計事項。 這些事項是在我對整體財務報表進行審計的過程中處理的，並且在形成我對該等財務報表的意見時予以考慮。 我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 金融資產及金融負債之公允價值衡量\n\n請參閱財務報表中的附註2.5、2.6及38.1。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團按公允價值計算的金融資產總額為港幣4,502,475百萬元，金融負債總額為港幣1,150,861百萬元。\n\n這類金融資產和金融負債中，有 89% 的公允價值，乃為活躍市場中相同資產或負債的報價（第一等級輸入），或基於可觀察市場數據的估值技術估算而得（第二等級輸入）。\n\n至於此類金融資產剩餘的11%，其公允價值乃採用以非可觀察市場數據為基礎的估值技術（第三層輸入）估計得出。 這些金融資產總計港幣5173億1600萬元，主要包括未上市投資基金。\n\n鑒於大量涉及的金額及估計，以公允價值評估金融資產及金融負債，為本次審計中的重要議題。\n\n財務資產及金融負債以公允價值計量之審計程序包括：\n\n- 了解評估不同類別金融資產及金融負債的程序，包括相關的控制措施；\n- 評估及測試控制措施，包括電腦系統的相關應用控制；\n- 就金融資產及金融負債的評估、存續、權利義務及完整性，取得外部確認；\n- 若採用公開市場價格，驗證該價格與獨立來源是否一致；\n- 若採用以可觀察市場數據為基礎的評估技術，評估評估方法是否恰當，以及假設是否合理，並驗證輸入數據與獨立來源是否一致；\n- 若採用以不可觀察市場數據為基礎的評估技術，評估評估方法是否恰當，以及假設及輸入數據是否合理。\n\n# 投資物業之公允價值評估\n\n請參閱財務報表附註2.11、18及19。\n\n截至2021年12月31日，本集團的投資物業按公允價值列賬，總額為27,089百萬港元。本集團同時在一家聯營公司及二十一家合營企業中擁有權益，總額為45,172百萬港元，其主要業務為持有海外投資物業。 這些投資物業的公允價值，無論由本集團直接持有、聯營公司或合營企業持有，主要乃根據獨立專業評估師的估值而定。 該等估值涉及重大判斷及估計，包括估值方法及所用假設。\n\n投資物業按公允價值評估的審計程序包括：\n\n- 取得並審閱本集團直接或透過聯營公司或合資企業持有的投資物業的估值報告，並核實其公允價值乃基於估值報告所載的估值；\n- 評估估值師的獨立性及資歷；及\n- 評估估值方法是否恰當，以及假設及輸入的合理性。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n金管局負責其他資料。該等其他資料包括香港金管局二零二一年年報內的所有資料，但不包括財務報表及我對該等財務報表的審計報告。\n\n我對財務報表的意見不涵蓋其他資訊，且對此類資訊不表達任何形式的鑒證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，評估該等其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計過程中取得的知識存在重大不一致，或以其他方式顯著失實。若根據我所執行的工作，我認為該等其他資訊存在重大失報，我必須報告該事實。在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的事項。\n\n# 貨幣顧問委員會及投資基金審核委員會審核基金財務報表的職責\n\n金管局負責編製財務報表，該財務報表應按照香港會計師公會頒佈的香港財務報告準則及根據《流通資金條例》第7節所發出的行政長官指示，真實、公平地反映財務狀況，並負責建立金管局認為為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤而必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣審查局負責評估本集團持續經營的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，並採用持續經營的會計基礎。\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會審核委員會轄下審計小組，負責監察本集團的財務報告流程。\n\n# 審計人對審計財務報表的責任\n\n我的目標是就財務報表整體是否免於重大錯誤表示合理確信，無論是因欺詐或錯誤所致，並出具包含我的意見的審計報告。合理確信是一種高度的確信，但並非保證，即使按照審計委員會的審計準則進行審計，也未必能在存在重大錯誤時發現。錯誤可能源於欺詐或錯誤，且若單獨或總計而言，可能合理預期會影響基於此等財務報表所做的使用者經濟決策，則被視為重大。\n\n作為遵照審計總署審計準則進行審計的一部分，我會運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑態度。我亦：\n\n識別並評估財務報表重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤造成，設計並執行對應於這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計憑證，為我的意見提供依據。因欺詐所導致未發現重大錯誤陳述的風險，高於因錯誤所導致的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛偽不實或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n取得對審計而言相關的內部控制瞭解，以設計適當於當時情況的審計程序，但非為表達對該集團內部控制成效的意見之目的；\n評估所使用的會計政策的恰當性，以及貨幣機關所做的會計估計及相關披露的合理性；\n對貨幣機關採用持續經營會計基礎的恰當性做出結論，並根據所取得的審計憑證，判斷是否存在與可能對該集團持續經營能力造成重大疑慮的事件或情況相關的重大不確定性。如果我認為存在重大不確定性，我須在我的審計報告中對財務報表中的相關披露事項加以提示，或若此等披露事項不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論乃基於截至我的審計報告日所取得的審計憑證。然而，未來事件或情況可能導致該集團無法持續經營；\n評估財務報表的整體呈現、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以實現公允表達的方式反映了相關交易和事件；以及\n取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務資訊的足夠且適當的審計憑證，以對財務報表表達意見。我對集團審計的指導、監督和執行負有責任。我對我的審計意見負有單獨的責任。\n\n我會向聯絡基金諮詢委員會審核小組匯報事項，包括審核的計劃範圍及時間，以及重要的審核發現，其中包含我在審核過程中識別到的任何重要的內部監控不足之處。\n\n我亦會向聯絡匯豐銀行顧問委員會的審核委員會提交聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的相關倫理要求，並向他們披露可能影響我獨立性的所有關係及其他事項，以及在適用的情況下，相關的保障措施。\n\n經與聯絡基金諮詢委員會審計小組溝通的事項，我判斷在截至本期財務報表審計中，最具重要性的事項，即為關鍵審計事項。我會在審計報告中描述這些事項，除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極其罕見的情況下，我認為將某事項不予披露，其可能產生的負面後果合理預期將會超過公開溝通所能帶來的公共利益。\n\n朱约翰審計主管\n"}
