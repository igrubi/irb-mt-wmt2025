{"en":"# Chief Executive’s Statement\n\nIn 2017, the global economy and financial markets performed much better than expected: the real economy saw steady growth; inflation remained subdued; the three interest rate hikes and the reduction in the balance sheet by the US Federal Reserve during the year did not result in capital outflows from emerging market economies or a strengthening of the US dollar. Amid bullish sentiment, global stock markets, including the three major US stock indices, kept hitting new highs. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged by 34%. The Hang Seng Index gained nearly 8,000 points (or 36%) in 2017 and surpassed the 30,000-point level to reach an all-time high in January 2018.\n\nMany investors were filled with optimism, even exuberance, in such a favourable environment. However, this was until early February this year when the latest data showed a higher than expected wage increase in the US, prompting investors to reappraise inflation risks and triggering significant corrections to global stock markets. The Dow Jones Index fell more than 1,000 points in two days during the second week of February, and the Hang Seng Index dropped more than 3,000 points in the same week. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to as high as 2.95%. The swift reversal of fund flows indicated that the record high market valuation was not built on a solid foundation. It also reminded us of the importance of a sound and robust financial system for Hong Kong to meet the challenges brought by asset market volatility and capital outflows.\n\n# Banking system resilience boosted by precautionary measures\n\nAs the saying goes, “prevention is better than cure”. The HKMA implemented further risk mitigation measures in 2017 to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong’s banking and financial systems. In May, we introduced the eighth round of countercyclical measures for banks’ mortgage loans and strengthened banks’ credit risk management on lending to property developers, with the aim of enhancing the banking system’s resilience to shocks arising from any downturn in the property market. With the several rounds of measures, the average loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% at the end of 2017 from 64% in September 2009, while the average debt servicing ratio also declined to 35% from 41% in August 2010.\n\nIn 2017, we established the Resolution Office to implement international standards on the resolution of non-viable financial institutions that are considered “too big to fail”. This will help prevent a recurrence of a global financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 where public money was used to save failing financial institutions, and will minimise the impact of their closures on the financial system, the economy and the community at large.\n\nRobust risk management is the cornerstone of steady and sustainable development of the banking sector. The liquidity ratio and capital adequacy ratio of Hong Kong’s banking system are well above the applicable statutory requirements and among the highest in the world. This undoubtedly reflects the high resilience of Hong Kong’s banking system. Indeed, the banking sector registered strong growth in 2017, with total loans increasing by 16%, while the asset quality also held up well. The classified loan ratio of retail banks fell to 0.54% from 0.72% in 2016, well below the long-term average of 2.2% since 2000. The banking industry’s overall return on equity (based on pre-tax operating profits) reached 11.74% in 2017, a very healthy level compared with other international financial centres.\n\n# Sound banking the key to long-term financial stability\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis revealed the limitations of relying solely on rules and regulations to restrain the financial industry from pursuing profitability without regard to their primary responsibilities. In light of this, the HKMA has stepped up the promotion of “sound banking” practices in recent years, encouraging banks to develop and pursue good corporate culture and values. In particular, to address the issue of bank staff pursuing short-term profits at the expense of the long-term interests of their customers or banks, we are encouraging banks to put in place appropriate incentive systems that are in line with their corporate culture and values. As part of this campaign, we arranged the inaugural Annual Conference for Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs) in March 2017 to highlight the importance of establishing a good banking culture and to empower the INEDs to perform their oversight and monitoring roles more effectively.\n\nWith the support of the banking industry, 2017 was a successful year for the HKMA in the advancement of financial inclusion. Six physical bank branches and three mobile branches began operating in remote areas. The Hong Kong Association of Banks worked out an arrangement with EPS and a convenience store chain to launch a pilot scheme allowing the elderly to withdraw cash from the stores in remote areas without the need to make purchases. Hongkong Post is also launching this year a cash withdrawal service for the elderly at seven Post Offices mainly on outlying islands and in the New Territories. Regarding account opening, the HKMA last year set up a webpage and an email account with a dedicated team to follow up public enquiries or complaints relating to the opening of bank accounts. Thanks to the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, there has been a significant improvement in customer experience in opening individual and corporate bank accounts.\n\n# Fintech a game changer for the banking industry\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, fintech has been gradually integrated into our daily lives. In this ever changing technological environment, banks must embrace new developments and pursue innovation in their application of fintech. With the new era of Smart Banking, the HKMA launched seven initiatives in September (see page 106 for details) promoting the adoption of fintech in banking to improve the quality of banking products and services for customers. While these initiatives are independent of one another, they are complementary and will be a game changer for the future landscape of payment and banking services in Hong Kong. Customers will not only enjoy more convenient, efficient and secure payment and banking services, they will also have more choices and greater control over their financial transactions. Fintech will be the key to banks’ future business success, and moving into the new era of Smart Banking will be a great opportunity for the banks to upgrade and transform themselves.\n\n# Enormous opportunities created by the Belt and Road and the Bay Area Initiatives\n\nWith competition among international financial centres becoming more intense, a diversified financial industry is of paramount importance to Hong Kong. In 2017, the HKMA stepped up its work on enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Given Hong Kong’s unparalleled advantage of “having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook”, the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area) will offer enormous opportunities for the financial and banking sectors and give new impetus to the economic growth of Hong Kong. The HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office, which was established in response to the Belt and Road Initiative, saw the number of its partners grow to around 90 since launch, laying a solid foundation for promoting Hong Kong as a financing hub for infrastructure investments. The issuance of the first Belt and Road bond in Hong Kong by the China Development Bank in 2017 highlighted the pivotal role Hong Kong can play in facilitating the financing of these infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure financing, we are actively involved in the development of Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres, private equity funds and Asian derivatives businesses, by attracting multinational corporations and major financial institutions to manage their funds, assets and various financial risks in the city. These initiatives will further consolidate and upgrade Hong Kong’s financial and related professional services sectors. The HKMA also maintains close dialogue with the relevant authorities responsible for the development of the Bay Area to strengthen collaboration with a view to contributing to the financial development of the area as a world-class city cluster.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong’s financial industry has been developing under the theme of “leveraging Hong Kong’s advantages, meeting the country’s needs”. With the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2016 and the Northbound Trading of Bond Connect in July last year, the mutual market access between the Mainland and the rest of the world through Hong Kong’s financial platform has been expanded from stock markets to bond markets. This underscores Hong Kong’s unique role as a financial intermediary in facilitating global investors’ access to the Mainland’s financial markets. In 2017, Hong Kong maintained its position as the leading global hub for offshore renminbi business. Average daily turnover of the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement system stood at RMB900 billion. In addition, according to SWIFT statistics, more than 70% of global renminbi payment transactions were handled through Hong Kong during the year. The offshore renminbi market continued to operate smoothly and develop steadily.\n\n# Nurturing talent to strengthen the soft power of the banking industry\n\nWith the continuing growth of the financial industry, nurturing talent is crucial to its sustainable development. The HKMA attaches great importance to the soft power of the banking industry, and we have been encouraging and supporting ongoing capacity building of banking practitioners. Following the introduction of two modules on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism and cybersecurity under the Enhanced Competency Framework, we expanded its coverage last year by including retail wealth management and treasury management to enhance the level of core competence of banking practitioners through continuing professional development. The HKMA is also committed to nurturing young talent for the banking industry. In 2017, we launched the Pilot Apprenticeship Programme for Private Wealth Management and the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the industry. Given the overwhelming response, the coverage of these programmes will be further expanded in the future.\n\n# Prudent investment strategy achieving a reasonable and stable return over the medium to long term\n\nOn the back of strong global economic growth, the Exchange Fund achieved a record high investment income of HK$264 billion last year with gains across the board, including equities, bonds and foreign exchange. The overall investment return was 7.4%. The Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the Backing Portfolio gained 1.8%. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP)’s annualised internal rate of return since its inception in 2009 reached as high as 13.7%. While the investment performance last year was satisfactory, the increasingly complex investment environment requires the HKMA to continue its prudent management of the Exchange Fund. We will remain agile and nimble, monitor market developments closely and deploy defensive measures as and when appropriate. Investments under the LTGP will also be further expanded. As always, the investment principle of “capital preservation first, long-term growth next” within acceptable risk levels will be adhered to when managing the wealth for the people of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the global real economy is extending last year’s growth momentum, uncertainties and risks still abound in 2018. These include a faster-than-expected pace of US interest rate hikes in case inflation picks up, escalating trade frictions and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape. Should these downside risks materialise, they will have significant and widespread implications for global financial markets, and knock-on effects for Hong Kong’s fund flows, asset prices and real economy. It is therefore advisable that we should all manage the risks prudently.\n\nIn the coming months, it is likely Hong Kong dollar interest rate movements will remain in the spotlight. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since December 2015. With widening spreads between Hong Kong dollar interest rates and their US dollar counterparts, there is a greater incentive for funds to flow from the Hong Kong dollar into the US dollar. The Hong Kong dollar has been under weakening pressure recently and the 7.85 weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered. As we have repeatedly stated, when the 7.85 weak-side CU is triggered, the HKMA will act as a “super money changer” by buying Hong Kong dollars and selling US dollars in the market to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will not weaken beyond the 7.85 level. Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System. This should not cause any concern. Indeed, the Exchange Fund currently holds more than HK$4 trillion worth of assets, of which the Hong Kong dollar Monetary Base amounts to about HK$1.7 trillion, providing a strong buffer in the event of fund outflows. Over the years, the HKMA has put in place various lines of defence to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems. From a positive perspective, capital outflows will lead to a gradual increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, which will be conducive to the normalisation of the interest rate environment in Hong Kong and hence the sustainable development of the local economy and asset markets. During this process, the HKMA will stay vigilant and make every effort to maintain monetary and banking stability in Hong

行政長官聲明\n\n在2018年，全球經濟和金融市場表現理想，遠超預期：實體經濟見到穩定增長；通脹仍然溫和；美國聯邦儲備局在當年進行的三次加息以及資產負債表縮減並未造成新興市場經濟體資本外流或美元升值。在牛氣沖天氣氛下，全球股市，包括美國三大指數，持續錄得新高。摩根士高聯 Emerging Markets 指數上漲了34%。恆生指數在2017年錄得近8,000點（或36%）的漲幅，突破30,000點水平，並在1月創下歷史新高。\n\n許多投資者在新高有利的環境下充滿了樂觀，甚至欣喜若狂。然而，直到今年2月最新數據顯示美國工資顯著上升，促使投資者重新評估通貨膨脹風險，並觸發全球股市的調整。道瓊斯指數在2月的第二同周內兩天下跌超過1,000點，恆生指數在同一同周下跌超過3,000點。10年期美國國債殖利率飆升至2.95%。資金流動的迅速逆轉顯示，創紀錄的高市盈率並非建立在紥實的根基上。它亦提醒我們，香港建立穩健的金融體系，以應對資產市場波動和資本外流所帶來的挑戰的重要性。\n\n# 銀行系統韌性因防患未然的措施而提升。\n\n有云：「預防勝於治療」。金管局於2017年進一步實施風險減輕措施，旨在保障香港銀行和金融體系的穩定。5月，我們推出第八輪針對銀行按揭貸款的逆轉措施，並加強地產商貸款的銀行信貸風險管理，以加強銀行體系對房地產市場任何逆轉所引起的衝擊的保障。經過多個措施，新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率在2017年底跌至49%，而2009年9月的平均貸款價值比率為64%，平均償債比率亦下降至35%，而2010年8月為41%。\n\n2017年，我們設立了解決方案辦公室，以落實國際標準，處理被 考慮 “難以倒” 的不具備可行性的金融機構。這將 幫助 避免 重蹈 類似 2008年 發生的全球金融危機，當時 動用 公眾資金來拯救 面臨倒 境的金融機構，同時減低 他們 結業 對金融體系、經濟和社會的影響。\n\n健全的風險管理是銀行業穩定和可持續發展的基石。香港銀行體系的流動比率和資本充足率遠高於適用法定要求，在全球位居…前列。顯示香港銀行體系具有很強的韌性。事實上，銀行業在2017年錄得強勁增長，貸款總額增加16%，資產品質亦表現良好。零售銀行的不良貸款比率跌至2016年的0.72%的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來的長期平均水平2.2%。銀行業的整體股東回報率（基於除稅前經營利潤）在2017年達11.74%，相較於其他國際金融中心而言，是一個非常健康的新高。\n\n# 穩健的銀行業是長期金融穩定的關鍵。\n\n2008年全球金融危機暴露了單憑規則和法規來制約金融業追求利潤，而未有顧及其主要責任的局限。 鑑於此，香港金管局近年來加強了“穩健”銀行業務 практики 的推廣，鼓勵銀行發展和追求良好的企業文化和價值觀。 特別是為了解決銀行員工追求短期利潤，損害其顧客或銀行長期利益的問題，我們鼓勵銀行將適當的激勵制度安排在與其企業文化和價值觀相符的主軸上。 作為此計劃的一部分，我們安排了首屆獨立非執行董事（INEDs）年度會議，於2017年3月舉行，以突顯樹立良好銀行文化的重要性，並幫助INEDs更有效地發揮其監督和監察的角色。\n\n得益於銀行業的支持，2017年金管局在推動金融普惠方面取得成功。6間實體銀行分行和3個流動銀行分行開始在偏遠地區營運。香港銀行公會與EPS及一間便利店連鎖店合作，推出一項試驗計劃，讓長者可以在偏遠地區的便利店提款，未有購買的需求。香港郵政今年亦將推出為長者提供的提款服務，主要在離島及新界地區的七個郵局。在…方面開戶，金管局去年設立了一個專頁和一個電子郵件賬戶，並組成了一個專責團隊跟進公眾對銀行開戶的查詢或投訴。經多方持份者的努力，在開立個人及公司銀行賬戶的客戶體驗方面取得了顯著改善。\n\n# 金融科技為銀行業帶來變革。\n\n在一場快速科技發展的新紀元，金融科技已逐步融入我們的生活。在這個不斷變化的科技環境中，銀行必須把握新發展，並在金融科技的應用上追求創新。隨著智慧銀行新紀元的到來，香港金管局於9月推出七項倡議（詳見106頁），推動金融科技在銀行業的採用，以加強銀行產品和服務的品質，惠及顧客。 這些倡議彼此獨立，但又互補，將會為香港支付和銀行服務的未來生態帶來重大轉型。 顧客不僅可以享受更方便、快捷和安全的支付及銀行服務，而且還將擁有更多選擇和對其金融交易的更大控制權。 金融科技將是銀行未來業務成功的關鍵，邁進智慧銀行的新紀元將為銀行升級和轉型提供一項絕佳的機會。\n\n# 「一帶一路」倡議和灣區計劃締造了龐大的機遇範疇。\n\n隨著國際金融中心之間的競爭位居…前列日益激烈，多元化的金融業對香港的至關重要性不言而喻。 2017年，香港金管局加強了其工作，以加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。 鑑於香港擁有“背靠內地，同時維持國際前景”的無與倫比的優勢，一帶一路倡議和粵港澳大灣區（灣區）的發展將帶來龐大的機遇，為金融和銀行業帶來新的動力，並推動香港的經濟增長。 為呼應一帶一路倡議而設立的香港金管局基礎設施融資促進辦事處，自推出以來，其夥伴的數字約增加至90個，打下紥實的根基，以推動香港成為基礎設施投資的融資中心。 中國開發銀行於2017年在香港發行首批一帶一路債券，突顯了香港在促進這些基礎設施項目融資方面可以發揮的樞紐地位。\n\n此外，除了基礎設施融資外，我們積極參與將香港發展成企業財務中心、私募股本基金和亞洲衍生品業務的樞紐，透過吸引跨國企業和主要金融機構到該城市管理其資金、資產和多個金融風險。 這些舉措將進一步鞏固和升級香港的金融和相關專業服務範疇。 香港金管局亦維持與有關灣區發展的相關部門的緊密溝通，肩負起鞏固合作，以促進該範疇作為世界級城市群的金融發展的責任。\n\n多年來，香港的金融業以「善用香港的優勢，滿足內地的所需」為主軸而發展。隨著2014年滬港股票通、2016年深港股票通以及去年7月債券通北向交易的推出，通過香港的金融平台，內地與全球的市場互通互聯已從股票市場擴展至債券市場。這突顯了香港作為促進全球投資者接觸內地金融市場的獨特地位。2017年，香港維持了作為全球離岸人民幣業務領先地位。人民幣即時總額結算系統的平均每日成交額高達9,000億元人民幣。此外，根據SWIFT統計，在該年，超過70%的全球人民幣支付交易通過香港運作。離岸人民幣市場繼續有序發展。\n\n# 培育人才以鞏固銀行業的實力。\n\n隨著金融業持續增長，培育人才對其可持續發展至關重要。香港金管局注重銀行業的實力，我們一直致力鼓勵和支持銀行從業員的持續能力發展。繼推出兩項關於打擊洗錢及資助恐怖主義和網絡安全的專業資歷後，我們去年擴展了其覆蓋範圍，包括零售財富管理和財富管理，藉此提升銀行從業員的核心能力，透過持續專業發展。香港金管局亦致力培育年青金融人才。於2017年，我們與業界合作推出私人財富管理試業見習計劃及金融科技職業加速計劃。鑑於反應熱烈，這些計劃的覆蓋範圍將在未來進一步擴展。\n\n# 謹慎的投資策略，旨在於中長期內取得平穩的回報。\n\n受益於強勁的全球經濟增長，投資基金去年錄得2,640億香港元的新高投資回報，包括股票、債券和外匯在內，各項投資均錄得佳績。整體投資回報為7.4%。投資組合的年回報率達致12.1%，而支持組合錄得1.8%。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）自成立以來，年化內部回報率於2009年以來一直維持於13.7%的新高水平。儘管去年投資表現令人滿意，但日益複雜的投資環境需要金管局繼續管理投資基金的謹慎管理。我們將一向保持機動靈活，密切監察市場發展，並在適當的時候部署防禦措施。長期增長投資組合下的投資亦將進一步擴展。一向秉承“首重保本，之後追求長期增長”的投資原則，並在可控風險水平內管理香港市民的財富。\n\n雖然全球實體經濟延續 去年 的 升勢，不明朗因素 與 風險 仍然 潛藏 在 2018年。這些 包括 超乎預期 的 加息 步伐，一旦 通膨 上升，將 觸發 美國 利率 加息；升級 的 貿易摩擦 以及 惡化 的 地政體系 生態。一旦 這些 下行 風險 觸發，將 對 全球 金融 市場 產生 顯著 且 廣泛 的 影響，並 對 香港 的 資金 流動、資產 價格 以及 實體經濟 產生 連鎖 影響。因此 應該 謹慎 地 管理 風險。\n\n未來數月，相信香港美元利率走勢將繼續成為焦點。美國聯邦儲備局自2015年12月以來已提升利率6次。隨著香港美元利率與其美元對應的息差擴闊，有更大的誘因促使資金從香港美元流向美元。近期，香港美元正處於走弱壓力之下，而7.85弱方可換成交易保證（CU）已被觸發。事實上，我們一再強調，當7.85弱方CU被觸發時，香港金管局將充當“超級換匯商”，在市場上購買香港美元並出售美元，以保證香港美元匯率不會走弱至7.85水平及前瞻。此等操作是正常，並且按照聯匯機制的设计。這不應引起任何關注。事實上，投資基金目前持有超過1,700億美元的資產，其中香港美元貨幣基礎數額約為1.7兆，在資金外流的事件中提供強大的緩衝。多年來，香港金管局已在各方面建立多個防線，以保障銀行和金融系統的穩定。從正面來看，資本外流將導致香港美元利率逐步上升，這有助於香港利率環境的正常化，因而促進本地經濟和資產市場的可持續發展。在此過程中，香港金管局將嚴陣以待，並努力保持香港的貨幣和銀行穩定。\n"}

The local stock market rallies and residential property market maintains its upward momentum, while housing affordability stretches further.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains safe and sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions and healthy asset quality.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar eases against the US dollar as a result of the widening negative interest rate spreads between the two currencies. Nevertheless, the public remains highly confident in the Linked Exchange Rate System.\n\nThe money markets continue to operate smoothly with ample interbank liquidity. The Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by a total of 75 basis points to 1.75%, in tandem with the increase in the target range for the US federal funds rate.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA places its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of banks’ risk governance framework, including credit, liquidity and technology risk management. The eighth round of countercyclical macroprudential measures is introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector against any downturn in the property market.\n\nOn the policy side, substantial progress is made on the local implementation of international supervisory standards. The resolution regime comes into operation, establishing a new line of defence for banking stability. The Resolution Office is established as part of the HKMA’s efforts to make the resolution regime operational for the Hong Kong banking sector.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nSeven new initiatives are introduced to embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology and to promote Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia. Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments is raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building.\n\nHong Kong maintains its leading position in offshore renminbi business. The launch of the Bond Connect reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\nBenefiting from a favourable investment environment, the Exchange Fund achieves a record high investment income of HK$264 billion, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\nEfforts on investment diversification continue, especially through the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The LTGP records an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communication with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and other various channels to facilitate public understanding of its policies and operations.\n\nThe HKMA continues to improve corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, and enhancing IT security to cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.\n","terms":{"city":["城市"],"end":["年底"],"people":["市民"],"built":["建立"],"expanded":["擴展"],"achieving":["取得"],"continuing":["持續"],"pursue":["追求"],"us":["我們"],"saw":["見到"],"abound":["潛藏"],"record":["紀錄"],"remained":["仍然"],"since":["自"],"HK":["香港"],"49":["49%"],"launch":["推出"],"first":["首"],"adoption":["採用"],"webpage":["專頁"],"year":["年"],"increasing":["增加"],"facilitating":["促進"],"billion":["億"],"’":["的"],"lives":["生活"],"great":["重大"],"marks":["適逢"],"competence":["能力"],"developments":["發展"],"reversal":["逆轉"],"indicated":["顯示"],"Thanks":["經"],"brought":["帶來"],"secure":["安全"],"introduction":["推出"],"classified":["不良"],"encouraging":["鼓勵"],"developers":["地產商"],"2014":["2014年"],"transform":["轉型"],"developing":["開展"],"widening":["擴闊"],"strengthen":["鞏固"],"operate":["運作"],"campaign":["計劃"],"upgrade":["升級"],"maintained":["維持"],"technological":["科技"],"hence":["因而"],"2008":["2008年"],"highlight":["突顯"],"era":["新紀元"],"among":["位居…前列"],"role":["地位"],"41":["41%"],"weathered":["克服"],"addition":["此外"],"fell":["跌"],"pursuing":["追求"],"enhancing":["加強"],"coming":["未來"],"launched":["推出"],"times":["次"],"stepped":["加強"],"efforts":["努力"],"February":["2月"],"1.8":["1.8%"],"concerted":["多方"],"established":["設立"],"11.74":["11.74%"],"together":["一同"],"ensure":["保證"],"result":["造成"],"weaken":["走弱"],"responsibilities":["責任"],"play":["發揮"],"modules":["專業資歷"],"RMB900":["9,000億元人民幣"],"2010":["2010年"],"practitioners":["從業員"],"second":["第二"],"involved":["參與"],"closures":["結業"],"integrated":["融入"],"implement":["落實"],"moving":["邁進"],"make":["讓"],"give":["帶來"],"part":["部分"],"convenient":["方便"],"case":["一旦"],"dropped":["下跌"],"also":["亦"],"gained":["錄得"],"May":["5月"],"always":["一向"],"vigilant":["嚴陣以待"],"created":["締造"],"undoubtedly":["顯示"],"light":["情況下"],"round":["輪"],"needs":["所需"],"opportunities":["機遇"],"sustainable":["可持續"],"competition":["競爭"],"2.2":["2.2%"],"increase":["上升"],"7.85":["7.85"],"foundation":["根基"],"accounts":["賬戶"],"revealed":["暴露"],"quarter":["四分之一"],"smoothly":["有序"],"maintain":["保持"],"perform":["發揮"],"recurrence":["重蹈"],"week":["同周"],"3,000":["3,000"],"set":["設立"],"dollars":["美元"],"several":["多個"],"last":["去年"],"including":["包括"],"shocks":["衝擊"],"high":["新高"],"pace":["步伐"],"world":["全球"],"within":["內"],"response":["呼應"],"stated":["強調"],"century":["世紀"],"competitiveness":["競爭力"],"significant":["顯著"],"adhered":["秉承"],"25th":["25周年"],"satisfactory":["佳績"],"changing":["變"],"extending":["延續"],"Given":["鑑於"],"page":["專頁"],"close":["緊密"],"greater":["更大"],"September":["9月"],"ever":["以來"],"held":["舉辦"],"introduced":["推出"],"coverage":["覆蓋"],"need":["需求"],"Six":["6"],"develop":["發展"],"include":["包括"],"triggered":["觸發"],"manage":["管理"],"25":["25"],"restrain":["制約"],"wage":["工資"],"leveraging":["善用"],"eighth":["第八輪"],"improvement":["改善"],"all-time":["歷史"],"consolidate":["鞏固"],"Enormous":["龐大"],"highlighted":["突顯"],"stood":["高達"],"importance":["重要性"],"agile":["機動"],"responsible":["肩負"],"pivotal":["樞紐"],"reached":["達"],"allowing":["讓"],"good":["好"],"independent":["獨立"],"highs":["新高"],"0.72":["0.72%"],"put":["將"],"0.54":["0.54%"],"advantage":["優勢"],"spotlight":["焦點"],"prevent":["避免"],"around":["約"],"dialogue":["溝通"],"used":["動用"],"cure":["治療"],"safeguard":["保障"],"appropriate":["適當"],"months":["月"],"prompting":["促使"],"particular":["特別"],"advancement":["推動"],"providing":["提供"],"highest":["最高"],"saying":["有云"],"without":["未有"],"nimble":["機動"],"store":["便利店"],"achieved":["取得"],"oversight":["監督"],"corrections":["調整"],"implications":["影響"],"cornerstone":["基石"],"effort":["努力"],"meet":["應對"],"maintaining":["維持"],"paramount":["至關重要"],"continued":["繼續"],"position":["地位"],"minimise":["減低"],"35":["35%"],"expense":["損害"],"empower":["幫助"],"worked":["合作"],"years":["年"],"2018":["2018年"],"closely":["密切"],"issuance":["發行"],"establishing":["樹立"],"long":["長期"],"diversified":["多元化"],"underscores":["突顯"],"landscape":["生態"],"healthy":["健康"],"promoting":["推動"],"challenges":["挑戰"],"easily":["不易"],"solid":["紥實"],"ongoing":["持續"],"task":["任務"],"efficient":["快捷"],"recently":["近期"],"gradual":["逐步"],"back":["背靠"],"positive":["正面"],"fail":["倒"],"perspective":["來看"],"106":["106頁"],"laying":["打下"],"advisable":["應該"],"various":["多個"],"innovation":["創新"],"follow":["跟進"],"attaches":["注重"],"widespread":["廣泛"],"Many":["許多"],"downside":["下行"],"relying":["依靠"],"T.L":["T.L."],"hikes":["加息"],"status":["地位"],"264":["2,640億"],"inaugural":["首屆"],"offer":["帶來"],"bullish":["牛氣沖天"],"next":["之後"],"reappraise":["重新評估"],"society":["社會"],"continue":["繼續"],"outlying":["離島"],"taking":["採取"],"roles":["角色"],"strengthened":["加強"],"areas":["地區"],"one":["一"],"nurturing":["培育"],"Indeed":["事實上"],"levels":["水平"],"enhance":["提升"],"worst":["最壞"],"actively":["積極"],"successful":["成功"],"line":["主軸"],"convenience":["便利"],"normal":["正常"],"trillion":["兆"],"deteriorating":["惡化"],"movements":["走勢"],"currently":["現時"],"impetus":["動力"],"pressure":["壓力"],"8,000":["8,000"],"launching":["開展"],"supporting":["支持"],"arranged":["安排"],"gains":["回報"],"Supporting":["支持(組合)"],"1.7":["1,700億"],"reduction":["縮減"],"Regarding":[

摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在配合全球經濟擴張的背景下，步伐加快。本地股市上升，住宅物業市場維持其升勢，而房屋可負擔能力收緊。\n\n香港銀行業維持安全及穩健，擁有強大的資本和流動性，資產品質健康。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港美元兌美元的回軟，造成兩地貨幣息差擴闊的結果。然而，公眾對聯匯制度維持高度信心。\n\n貨幣市場繼續有序運作，流動性充裕。香港基本利率總計上升75厘至1.75厘，因應我們聯邦基金利率目標區間的上升。\n\n# 銀行穩定性\n\n金管局將其監管的重點放在銀行風險管治框架的有效性上，包括信貸、流動資金和科技風險管理。第八輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施推出，以鞏固銀行業就房地產市場任何逆轉的韌性。\n\n在政策方面，本地落實國際監管標準已取得重大進展。 解決機制生效，設立了維護銀行穩定性的一條新主軸。 解決辦公室的設立是香港金管局努力讓解決機制在香港銀行業運作的其中一部分。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n七項新舉措推出，旨在把握龐大的機遇，這些機遇是由銀行業和科技的匯聚所帶來的，並推動香港成為亞洲金融科技中心。 經一連串的努力，香港作為基礎設施投資融資中心的國際形象得到進一步提升。\n\n香港維持其在離岸人民幣業務中的領先地位。 債券互聯互通的推出，鞏固了香港作為連接內地主要機遇的門戶的地位。\n\n# 儲備管理\n\n受益於有利的投資環境，投資基金達到一項紀錄新高，投資收益為2,640億港元，為7.4%的投資回報。\n\n投資多元化方面的努力 繼續，特別是透過長期增長投資組合（LTGP）。LTGP 自 2009 年起至今，創下了年化內部報酬率 13.7% 的紀錄。\n\n#

{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, Hong Kong saw faster economic growth, tighter labour market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures in 2017. Economic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Real activities\n\nAmid a more synchronised expansion of the global economy, the Hong Kong economy grew faster in 2017. Growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 3.8%, much higher than the 2.1% growth in 2016 and the long-term growth of about 3% over the past decade (Chart 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand firmed up, with private consumption growth accelerating and overall investment spending reviving. Stronger domestic demand reflected favourable job and income conditions, booming asset prices and improved business sentiment. Externally, Hong Kong’s exports of goods expanded at a faster pace due to increased global trade flows, and exports of services recovered because of vibrant trade and cargo flows and improving inbound tourism. Imports of goods recorded stronger growth on export-induced demand, and imports of services increased steadily amid strong travel interest among residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus shrank, making a negative contribution to GDP growth.\n\n\n# Monetary conditions\n\nOn the monetary front, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally eased against the US dollar driven primarily by interest rate arbitrage activities amid the negative interest rate differentials between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. This reflected the normal functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System in accordance with its design. While still at relatively low levels, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates faced more upward pressures towards the end of 2017 due to Initial Public Offeringrelated funding demand and banks’ year-end liquidity needs. For credit growth, after two years of single-digit growth, total bank loans increased at a notably faster pace of 16.1% in 2017, reflecting improving economic conditions and positive financial market sentiment. Despite faster loan growth, there were no signs of loosening of banks’ credit underwriting standards, and overall loan quality remained good.\n\n# Inflation\n\nInflationary pressures remained well contained throughout 2017 (Chart 2). Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate declined to 1.7%, down from 2.3% in 2016. In particular, the housing component of the price index increased at a milder pace, reflecting the filter-through of slower increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals in 2016. More broadly, milder increases in nominal wages and earnings amid strong output growth helped keep local cost pressures in check. Import price inflation was also tame, in line with low inflation in Hong Kong’s major import sources despite a weaker US dollar.\n\n# Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened in 2017 along with above-par economic growth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 3.4% in 2016 to 2.9% towards the end of 2017, below 3% for the first time in nearly 20 years (Chart 3). Most major economic sectors registered decreases in their respective unemployment rates, with more notable declines seen in the retail, financing and professional and business services sectors. As total employment grew faster and the number of private-sector vacancies picked up, overall labour demand continued to strengthen. The labour force also expanded, partly reflecting more active participation of older-age workers (aged 55 and above). Consistent with tighter labour market conditions and lower inflation, real wages and earnings saw faster increases.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market had an almost uninterrupted rally in 2017. The Hang Seng Index rose by 36%, the largest annual gain since 2010 (Chart 4). The rally reflected optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings, and was in part supported by substantial fund inflows from Mainland investors through the Stock Connects. The Hang Seng Index hit a ten-year high in November and remained at high levels towards the end of 2017. Average daily turnover expanded to HK$88.3 billion from HK$66.9 billion in the previous year, and overall equity funds raised from the local market also increased to HK$581.4 billion, compared with HK$490.1 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nThe residential property market maintained its upward momentum throughout the year (Chart 4). Transaction volume expanded from 54,701 units a year ago to 61,591 units and housing prices increased by 14.8% in 2017. Housing affordability stretched further, with a price-toincome ratio of 16.4, higher than the previous peak in 1997, and an income-gearing ratio of 74.1, far above its long-term average.1 In view of rising property prices and the intensifying competition for mortgage business among banks, the HKMA introduced the eighth round of prudential measures in May to strengthen banks’ risk management and safeguard banking stability. Housing price growth moderated temporarily following these measures before accelerating in the fourth quarter. As for the commercial and industrial property markets, trading activities increased significantly during the year, with both transaction value and volume registering double-digit growth. With the pick-up in non-residential property prices, corresponding rental yields fell slightly compared to the previous year.\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nEconomic growth for 2018 is expected to remain solid. The Government forecasts growth in the range of 3–4%, while private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at an average rate of 3.2%. Externally, Hong Kong’s export performance will continue to benefit from the improving global growth outlook and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism. Domestically, private consumption growth is expected to hold up mainly as a result of favourable labour market conditions. As for fixed capital formation, building and construction activity should progress steadily on the back of rising housing supply and continuing infrastructure projects. While improved economic conditions will support business capital spending, headwinds may come from potential rises in interest rates.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nWith still-moderate global inflation and steady increase in local costs, inflationary pressures in Hong Kong are anticipated to remain moderate in 2018, but the inflation rate is likely to pick up gradually from the low in 2017. For example, the rental component of inflation may gather momentum in the latter part of 2018 because of feedthrough from increases in fresh-letting private residential rentals. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate to be a still-moderate 2.2% for 2018, and the Government projects the underlying inflation rate to be 2.5%. On the other hand, sustained economic growth, expanding building and construction activity and the gradual recovery in inbound tourism are expected to keep the labour market tight in the near future. Private-sector analysts forecast the unemployment rate to stay at about 3.0% in 2018.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2018 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks including those relating to major central banks’ monetary policy normalisation and global financial market stability, as well as heightened protectionist sentiment and deteriorating geopolitical tensions. In particular, if such risks materialise to trigger reversal of fund flows in Hong Kong, local monetary conditions could tighten faster than expected, putting downward pressures on the real economy and asset prices.\n\nThe outlook for the residential property market remains uncertain. In the near term, the current favourable domestic economic conditions, perceived housing shortage, low mortgage rates and alternative sources of home financing (including mortgage loans provided by property developers and financial support from parents), will continue to support the demand for properties. However, the recent sell-off in global financial markets may dampen sentiments. Over the longer term, the property market will continue to face a number of headwinds. In particular, as the US monetary policy normalisation continues, domestic mortgage rates will rise eventually. In addition, on the back of the Government’s effort to increase the supply of land and residential properties, the housing demand-supply gap is expected to narrow gradually, which would ease the upward pressure on property prices in the longer term.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector continued to be safe and sound in 2017 notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The capital and liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) remained strong, asset quality stayed at healthy levels, and profitability improved notably thanks to increased interest margins and robust credit growth.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nAs the US interest rate normalisation continued, the onemonth and three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) fixings increased by 49 basis points and 39 basis points respectively in 2017. More notable rises were observed in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks, as measured by the composite interest rate, remained broadly stable over the year (Chart 5).\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks’ Hong Kong offices grew by 15.8% in 2017. The improved performance was mainly due to increases in net interest income (+20.3%) and fee and commission income (+9.4%). However, these increases were partially offset by a decline in income from foreign exchange and derivatives operations (-29.9%) and a growth in operating expenses (+8.4%). The aggregate post-tax profit of retail banks dropped by 18.1% because of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2016. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks dropped to 1.07% from 1.44% in 2016 (Chart 6).\n\nRetail banks’ net interest margin widened to 1.45% in 2017 from 1.32% in 2016 (Chart 7) mainly due to rising market interest rates.\n\nThe proportion of retail banks’ non-interest income to total operating income decreased to 40% from 44.3% in 2016. While fee and commission income increased by 9.4%, income originated from foreign exchange and derivatives operations dropped by 29.9%.\n\nRetail banks’ cost-to-income ratio declined to 41.9% in 2017 from 43.2% in 2016, as operating costs (+8.4%) increased at a slower pace than operating income (+11.8%) (Chart 8). Retail banks’ loan impairment charges decreased to HK$7.3 billion from HK$8 billion in 2016.\n\n# Asset quality\n\nLoan quality of retail banks improved during the year, with the classified loan ratio decreasing to 0.54% from 0.72% a year earlier. The overdue and rescheduled loan ratio also decreased to 0.4% from 0.53% in 2016 (Chart 9). Similarly, the classified loan ratio and the overdue and rescheduled loan ratio of the whole banking sector decreased to 0.67% and 0.52%, from 0.85% and 0.67% respectively.\n\nThe quality of banks’ residential mortgage lending portfolios remained good, with the delinquency ratio staying at a low level of 0.03% at the end of 2017 (Chart 10). The rescheduled loan ratio was close to 0%. There was no residential mortgage loan in negative equity at the end of the year, as compared with four cases a year ago.\n\nThe delinquency ratio of credit card lending stayed low at 0.22% at the end of 2017, compared with 0.24% a year ago (Chart 10). The combined delinquent and rescheduled loan ratio edged down to 0.31% from 0.33% during the period. The charge-off ratio also fell slightly to 1.75% from 1.92% in 2016.\n\n# Balance sheet trends\n\nTotal loans of the banking sector grew by 16.1% in 2017, compared with 6.5% in 2016. Demand for credit increased, driven by optimism about the global economic outlook. As total deposits increased at a slower pace than total loans, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 73% at the end of 2017 from 68.4% a year earlier. The Hong Kong-dollar loan-to-deposit ratio also increased to 82.7% from 77.1% during the same period (Chart 11).\n\nMainland-related lending (including loans booked in Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks) increased by 17.5% in 2017, compared with a growth of 7% recorded in 2016.\n\n# Holdings of negotiable debt

經濟與金融環境\n\n在全球經濟協調擴張的背景下，香港見到經濟增長加快、勞工市場狀況收緊以及溫和的通脹壓力於2017年。預計2018年的經濟增長將會維持紥實。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 實際活動\n\n在更協調的全球經濟擴張下，香港經濟在2017年增長加快。實際國內生產總值（GDP）增長上升至3.8%，遠高於2016年的2.1%增長，以及過去10年約3%的長期增長（圖1和表1）。本地消費需求穩健，私人消費增長加快，總體投資支出回升。更強勁的本地需求反映了有利的就業狀況和收入狀況，上漲的資產價格以及改善的商譽。外圍方面，由於全球貿易流量上升，香港的商品出口擴展加快；由於暢旺的貿易和貨物流量以及提升的入境旅遊業，服務出口有所復甦。商品進口錄得更強勁的增長，受出口帶動的擴張需求影響，服務進口則在強勁的旅遊興趣在...下穩步上升，本地居民位居…前列。從淨值來看，總貿易盈餘收窄，對GDP增長產生負面影響。\n\n\n# 貨幣狀況\n\n在貨幣方面，儘管香港聯匯面對美國美元的貶勢，主要受到香港與美國之間的利差所推動的套利活動在...下，但一般情況下仍然正常。這反映了聯匯制度按照其設計運作。儘管水平仍然相對低，但由於新股融資需求和銀行年底的資金所需，香港銀行同業利率在2017年底面臨更大的升勢。就信貸增長而言，在連續兩年個位數增長後，2017年銀行貸款總額以16.1%的步伐加快上升，反映了提升的經濟狀況和正面金融市場情緒。儘管貸款增長加快，但沒有放寬銀行信貸承保標準的跡象，總體貸款品質仍然好。\n\n# 通貨膨脹\n\n通貨膨脹壓力在2017年整個過程中仍然得到良好控制（圖2）。儘管剔除政府的一次性紓緩措施的影響，其基本通貨膨脹率下降至1,700億，較2016年的2.3%有所下降。特別是，價格指數中的房屋組成項目上升的步伐放緩，反映了2016年私人住宅租金新簽訂的上升速度減緩的滲透。大致而言，名義工資和收入的上升幅度溫和，在強勁的產出增長在...下，有助於遏抑本地成本壓力。進口價格通貨膨脹也相對溫和，與香港主要進口資料來源的低通貨膨脹相符，儘管美元轉弱。\n\n# 勞工市場\n\n2017年就業市場收緊，伴隨著高於趨勢的經濟增長。季節性調整後的失業率從2016年的3.4% 跌至2017年底的2.9%，這是近20年來首度低於3%（圖3）。大多數主要經濟部門錄得各自的失業率回落，零售、融資以及專業和商業服務部門的數字明顯下降。隨著總體就業增長加快，私營部門空缺增加，整體勞動力需求繼續鞏固。勞動力亦擴展，部分反映了年長員工（55歲及以上）的參與更加活躍。在...下更緊繃的就業市場狀況和更低的通貨膨脹，實際工資和收入見到加快的增加。\n\n# 股票市場\n\n香港股票市場在2017年經歷了幾乎沒有中斷的上升。恆生指數上升了36%，創下2010年以來最大年增幅（圖4）。這段上升反映了對全球經濟和企業盈利的樂觀，部分地得到來自內地投資者透過股票互聯互通的重大資金流入支持。恆生指數在11月創下十年新高，並在2017年底仍然維持在高水平。平均每日成交額從上一年的港幣669億元提升至港幣883億元，而本地發行的整體股本基金也上升至港幣5814億元，較一年前的港幣4901億元有所增加。\n\n# 房地產市場\n\n住宅物業市場全年維持了升勢（圖4）。交易量從一年前的54,701宗上升至61,591宗，而房屋價格於2017年上升了14.8%。房屋可負擔能力越趨激烈，樓價與收入比率為16.4，較1997年的次高位遠高，而收入負擔比率為74.1，遠高於長期平均水平。鑑於樓價上升以及銀行之間按揭業務競爭越趨激烈，金管局於5月推出第八輪審慎措施，以鞏固銀行風險管理並保障銀行穩定。這些措施之後，房屋價格增長短暫回升，然後在第4季加速。至於商業和工業物業市場，交易活動在年內顯著上升，交易價值和數量均錄得雙位數增長。隨著非住宅物業價格的回升，相應的租金回報率較去年微升。\n\n# 經濟前景\n\n# 經濟環境\n\n2018年的經濟增長預計將維持紥實。政府的預測顯示增長將在3至4%的範圍內，而私營部門分析師則預測經濟將以平均3.2%的速率擴大。外圍方面，香港的出口表現將持續受惠於提升的全球增長前景和逐步回升的入境旅遊狀況。國內方面，私人消費的進展主要由於有利的勞工市場狀況而得以維持。至於固定資本形成，建築及施工活動應背靠上升的房屋供應和持續的基礎設施項目而穩步進展。雖然改善的經濟狀況將支持企業資本支出，但潛在的利率上升可能會造成阻力。\n\n# 通貨膨脹與勞工市場\n\n在全球溫和通脹及本地成本穩定上升的情況下，預期香港的通脹壓力將於2018年維持溫和，但通脹率相信會由2017年的低位逐步回升。例如，通脹的租金組成項目或於2018年下半年因新簽訂私人住宅租金的上升而增強升勢。市場共識預測標題通脹率將於2018年保持仍然溫和的2.2%。另一方面，政府預測核心通脹率為2.5%。另一方面，持續的經濟增長、擴大建築及地盤活動以及逐步回升的內地旅遊業，預計將在未來維持勞工市場偏緊。 私營機構分析員預測2018年的失業率將維持在約3.0%左右。\n\n# 不明朗因素與風險\n\n2018年的經濟前景可能受到不明朗因素和風險的影響，包括與主要中央銀行貨幣政策正常化和全球金融市場穩定相關的狀況，以及特別是保護主義情緒升溫和地緣政治緊張關係惡化。若此等風險觸發資金流動逆轉，香港的貨幣狀況可能加快收緊，構成對實際經濟和資產價格的下行壓力，亦可能出現。\n\n住宅物業市場的 前景 維持 不明朗。 在短期內，現時 有利 的國內經濟 狀況，被認為的房屋短缺，低 利率 以及 其他 房屋融資 管道（包括 地產商 提供 的按揭貸款以及家長 的財務支持），將 繼續 支持 房地產需求。 然而，近期 全球 財務 市場 的 拋售 可能 會 拖累 氣氛。 在 長遠 來看，物業市場 將 繼續 面對 一些 阻力。 特別是，隨著 美國貨幣政策 正常化 繼續，國內按揭利率 將 最終 上升。 此外，在 政府 努力 增加 土地 和 住宅物業 的 供應 的 影響下，預計 房屋供需缺口 將 逐步 縮小，這 將 緩和 房地產價格 的 升勢 壓力。\n\n# 金融業表現\n\n香港銀行業在2017年儘管全球經濟存在不明朗因素，仍然保持安全及穩健。獲授權金融機構（AIs）的資本及流動性狀況仍然強勁，資產質素維持在健康水平，而盈利得益於利息淨差上升及信貸增長強勁而顯著改善。\n\n# 利率走勢\n\n隨著美國利率正常化 繼續，一月期和三月期 香港銀行同業拆息 (HIBOR) 拆息 分別在 2017 年 上升了 49 個基點和 39 個基點。第4季 顯著的升幅 更為明顯。然而，以複合利率 衡量，香港 零售銀行 的 資金 成本 仍然 大致 平穩 一整年 (圖 5)。\n\n# 利潤趨勢\n\n零售銀行在香港的整體除稅前經營利潤於2016年增長了15.8%。主要的改善主要歸功於淨利息收入的增加 (+20.3%) 以及手續費收入的增加 (+9.4%)。然而，這些增加部分被外匯及衍生工具業務收入的下跌 (-29.9%) 以及經營開支的增長 (+8.4%) 抵銷。零售銀行的整體除稅後利潤因2016年錄得的特定項目而下跌了18.1%。零售銀行的平均資產除稅後回報率從2016年的1.44% 下跌至1.07% (圖6)。\n\n零售銀行淨利息差擴闊至2017年的1.45%，較2016年的1.32%（圖7）主要歸因於市場利率上升。\n\n零售銀行非利息收入佔總營運收入的比例下降至40%，較2016年的44%有所減少。儘管手續費及佣金收入上升了9.4%，但外匯及衍生工具業務所產生的收入下跌了29.9%。\n\n零售銀行成本收入比率下降至2017年的41.9%，較2016年的43.2%有所下降，原因是營運成本（+8.4%）的步伐比營運收入（+11.8%）上升得更放緩（圖8）。零售銀行的貸款減損損失下降至73億港元，較2016年的8億港元減少。\n\n#

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nDespite weakening pressure on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Hong Kong dollar exchange and money markets continued to operate in an orderly manner with ample liquidity. The Linked Exchange Rate System has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability and proved to be highly resilient against various shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong’s monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong’s currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75–7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises:\n- Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three noteissuing banks\n- Government-issued notes and coins in circulation\n- the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of the clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA\n- Exchange Fund Bills and Notes (EFBNs) issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the HKMA’s firm commitment to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than the demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Exchange rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate generally saw weakening pressure in 2017 (Chart 1). Driven mainly by interest carry trade activities amid widened negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates, the Hong Kong dollar eased gradually against the US dollar, from 7.7566 on 3 January to the year-low of 7.8265 on 22 August. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate gained some strength between late September and early November, underpinned by a tightening of Hong Kong dollar liquidity due to initial public offering (IPO)-related funding demand, and traded steadily within a narrow range of 7.80–7.81. Weakening pressures on the Hong Kong dollar were seen again towards the end of the year, partly reflecting slightly improved Hong Kong dollar liquidity conditions as well as increased year-end commercial demand for the US dollar. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market functioned normally throughout 2017.\n\nAs the CUs were not triggered, the total of the Aggregate Balance and outstanding EFBNs remained virtually unchanged at around HK$1,225.3 billion in 2017 (Chart 2). During the year, the HKMA issued a total of HK$80 billion additional Exchange Fund Bills to meet banks’ increased demand for liquidity management. This led to a contraction of the Aggregate Balance to HK$179.8 billion at the end of 2017. The issuance of additional Exchange Fund Bills was consistent with Currency Board principles, as it only represented a change in the composition of the Monetary Base, with a shift from the Aggregate Balance to the outstanding EFBNs. The Monetary Base remained fully backed by foreign exchange reserves.\n\n# Money market\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates stayed soft in the first eight months of 2017 before facing more upward pressure towards the end of the year (Chart 3). Despite concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and balance sheet normalisation, the Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally remained soft for the first eight months. As such, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates widened between January and August. From September onward, the shortdated Hong Kong dollar interbank rates witnessed large pick-ups, driven mainly by IPO-related and year-end funding demand. Correspondingly, the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates narrowed in the short-dated segment. Overall, the short-dated interbank rates traded mostly below the Base Rate in 2017.\n\nThe Base Rate was adjusted upwards on 16 March, 15 June and 14 December, by a total of 75 basis points from 1.00% to 1.75%, as the target range for the US federal funds rate moved upward three times by a total of 75 basis points from 0.50–0.75% to 1.25–1.50% during the year. The adjustment of the Base Rate was in accordance with the revised formula announced on 26 March 2009, in which the Base Rate is set at either 50 basis points above the lower bound of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.\n\nRoughly tracking the movements of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate spreads, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points widened gradually during the first three quarters, with the 12-month Hong Kong dollar forward points reaching about -615 pips in midSeptember (Chart 4). In the fourth quarter, the discounts of the Hong Kong dollar forward points narrowed slightly along with the narrowing of the negative spreads between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar interest rates. Overall, Hong Kong’s money market continued to operate in an orderly manner and interbank liquidity remained ample. Discount Window borrowing increased from HK$5.3 billion in 2016 to HK$10.3 billion in 2017.\n\n# The Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has served as a strong anchor for Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability, and proved to be highly resilient in a series of regional and global financial crises. The Government has reasserted its full commitment to the LERS and the credibility of its commitment was further reinforced by the stability in the foreign exchange and money markets. There is also continued strong public confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and a storage of value. In its 2017 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund reaffirmed its support for the LERS, commenting that the LERS remained the best exchange rate arrangement for Hong Kong. Combined with robust financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, and flexible markets, the LERS has worked well to help Hong Kong navigate successfully through both external and domestic challenges.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong.”\n\nA sound banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS. During 2017, the HKMA continued to monitor closely banks’ management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on corporate, property-related and mainland-related lending to bolster the resilience of the banking sector. As the US Federal Reserve continues to normalise its monetary policy, the Hong Kong dollar interest rates will gradually normalise as well. The HKMA reiterated that, under the design of the LERS, the outflow of capital, the weakening of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the triggering of the weak-side CU and the reduction of the Monetary Base are part of the necessary process of the normalisation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates. The HKMA also reminded the public to manage their risks prudently and be well prepared for potential financial turbulence.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio, defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base, moved within a range of 106.7–108.2% during 2017, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 108.1% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. In the event of abrupt shocks, the sizeable amount of financial resources of the Exchange Fund will provide a powerful backstop in protecting Hong Kong’s monetary and financial stability.\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Currency Board Sub-Committee (CBC) of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong. In 2017, the CBC considered various issues, including the drivers of short-run dynamics in Hong Kong’s housing prices, the determinants of HIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) spreads, the effect of property valuation changes on corporate borrowing in Mainland China, and the effect of mortgage debt service burden on private consumption in Hong Kong. Records of the CBC’s discussions on these issues and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the CBC are published on the HKMA website.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. Over the past three years, the HKIMR has been re-orienting its activities towards higher policy relevance. This is reflected, in particular, in its conference activities and visiting fellowship programmes. The HKIMR has been collaborating with major central banks and policy institutions to jointly organise more policyfocused conferences. Meanwhile, a thematic research fellowship programme introduced in 2016 has been supporting more research projects related to policy issues that are of importance to the HKMA.\n\nIn 2017, the HKIMR hosted 18 research fellows and published 29 working papers. It also organised four international conferences and workshops during the year:\n- The Eighth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy, titled “China’s Economic Rebalancing: Where is it Heading?”, was held in January in Hong Kong. The conference provided a forum for academics, policy makers and business economists to discuss important analytical and policy issues related to the Mainland economy. 11 highquality research papers were presented, covering a wide variety of issues including Mainland’s economic rebalancing, structural reform and international spillovers, issues on the renminbi exchange rate, and Mainland’s monetary policy framework and transmission.\n- The 15th HKIMR Summer Workshop was held in July. The workshop was intended to provide an opportunity for staff members of the HKIMR and the HKMA to present their research papers, and to enhance interaction between research staff and visiting fellows.\n- A joint conference organised by the HKMA and the Bank for International Settlements, titled “The Price, Real and Financial Effects of Exchange Rates”, was held in August. The conference provided a platform for in-depth and insightful discussion. A wide range of important topics were covered, including the exchange rate system, the pricing system of international trade, risk taking in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves, and foreign exchange market behaviour.\n- A conference jointly sponsored by the HKMA, the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons Learned” was held in October. The conference reviewed lessons learned from the unconventional monetary policies (UMP) of major central banks over the past ten years. The topics included monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, UMP and its spillovers to emerging economies, UMP and bank lending, and UMP and its effects on the real economy and financial

貨幣穩定性\n\n儘管對香港法定匯率的壓力減弱，香港外匯及貨幣市場繼續以有序的方式運作，並保持充裕的流動性。 聯匯制度一直是香港貨幣及金融穩定的強大支撐，並展現出高度的強大的承受衝擊能力，抵抗多個衝擊。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目標是貨幣平穩。這被定義為香港貨幣對美元在外匯市場上的匯率維持在7.75至7.85港元兌一美元的平穩外部匯率，內的一定範圍內。貨幣制度的結構以...計貨幣準備金制度安排，要求貨幣基礎至少由100%的美元儲備支持，並要求貨幣基礎的變動與美元儲備的相應變動100%匹配。我們舉辦了相關活動。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括：\n- 債務憑證，其提供十足擔保予三家發鈔銀行發行之鈔票；\n- 政府發行並流通中的紙幣和硬幣；\n- 整體餘額，即存放在香港金管局的各銀行結算賬戶餘額之總和；\n- 香港金管局代表政府發行之聯邦債券及票據。\n\n香港美元匯率的穩定性是透過自動利率調整機制以及香港金管局對兌換協議（CUs）的堅決承諾維持的。當對香港美元的需求大於供應，且市場匯率轉強至香港幣7.75對一美元的強方兌換協議時，香港金管局準備好將香港美元沽出給銀行，換取美元。整體結餘將擴大，推高香港美元利率，創造有利的貨幣狀況，使香港美元遠離強方限，維持在7.75至7.85的兌換區內。相反，如果香港美元的供應大於需求，且市場匯率走弱至香港幣7.85對一美元的弱方兌換協議時，香港金管局將從銀行買入香港美元。整體結餘將收縮，推高香港美元利率，使香港美元遠離弱方限，維持在兌換區內。\n\n# 2017 回顧\n\n# 匯率穩定\n\n香港 dollar 匯率一般見到壓力在 2017 年 (圖 1)。主要由息差擴闊，香港 dollar 與美國 dollar 利率之間的負息差，在...下推動，香港 dollar 對美國 dollar 逐步回軟，由 1 月 3 日的 7.7566 上升至 8 月 22 日的年內低位 7.8265。在 9 月底至 11 月初期間，香港 dollar 匯率錄得一些強大，因...而提升，原因是新股提供 (IPO) 相關資金需求，而匯率在 7.80至7.81 的窄幅內穩定。年底，對香港 dollar 的壓力再次出現，部分反映香港 dollar 流動性改善，以及商業對美國 dollar 的需求上升。總體而言，香港 dollar 匯率市場在 2017 年整個期間 функционировал normally。\n\n由於未有CU 觸發，總體結餘及未結清遠期外匯掉期總額在 2017 年仍然無大變動，約為 1,225.3 億港元（圖 2）。在該年，香港金管局發行了總額 80 億增發的結售滙票，以應對銀行對流動性管理的需求上升。這導致總體結餘在 2017 年底減少至 179.8 億港元。 增發結售滙票在...下符合法定金幣制原則，因為它僅屬於貨幣基礎的改變，即從總體結餘轉移至未結清遠期外匯掉期。貨幣基礎仍然全面支持外匯儲備。\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n香港美元銀行同業利率在2017年首8個月仍然穩定，但年底開始面臨更大的升勢壓力（圖3）。儘管對美國聯邦儲備局的加息和資產負債表正常化有顧慮，香港美元銀行同業利率一般仍然穩定，在首8個月。因此，香港美元與美國美元之間的息差在1月至8月擴闊。從9月起，短期香港美元銀行同業利率見到大幅回升，主要推動因素是新股集資活動和年底資金需求。相應地，短期香港美元與美國美元之間的息差在短期範疇內收窄。總體而言，短期銀行同業利率在2017年主要低於基準利率。\n\n基準利率已於3月16日、6月15日及12月14日上調，總計上調了75個基點，由1.00%上調至1.75厘，原因是美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在當年總計上調了75個基點，由0.50至0.75%上調至1.25–1.50%。基準利率的調整是按照2009年3月26日宣布的修訂公式實施的，該公式規定基準利率將設立於美國聯邦基金利率現行目標區間下限之上浮50個基點，或隔夜及一月期香港銀行同業拆息平均數（HIBORs）的五日平均數中，以較高者為準。\n\n大致追蹤香港港元與美元息差的走勢，香港港元遠期點的折讓在首三季擴闊，其中12個月的香港港元遠期點在九月中旬達到約-615點（圖4）。第4季，隨著香港港元與美元息差的收窄，香港港元遠期點的折讓微升。總體而言，香港的貨幣市場繼續以有序的方式運作，銀行間流動性仍然充裕。貼現窗借貸從2016年的港元5.3億上升至2017年的港元10.3億。\n\n# 聯匯 обмен రేటు వ్యవస్థ\n\n自一九八三年設立以來，聯匯制度（LERS）一直對香港的貨幣和金融穩定性構成強大的承受衝擊能力，並且在一系列區域性和全球性金融危機中展現了高度的韌性。政府重申了對聯匯制度的十足承諾，其承諾的可信度亦因外匯和貨幣市場的穩定而得到進一步強化。公眾對港幣作為支付手段和保值工具的信心持續強勁。在二零一七年與香港的第四次諮詢中，國際貨幣基金組織重申了對聯匯制度的支持，評論稱聯匯制度仍然是香港的最佳匯率安排。合併穩健的金融監管和管理，謹慎的財政管理以及靈活的市場，聯匯制度合作良好，有助於香港成功應對內外挑戰。\n\n國際貨幣基金組織：「聯匯制度對香港而言，仍然是最佳安排。」\n\n穩健的銀行體系對 LERS 的正常運作至關重要。 於 2017 年，香港金管局繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強了對企業、物業相關貸款及內地相關貸款的監察努力，以鞏固銀行業的韌性。 隨著美國聯邦儲備局繼續回復至正常其貨幣政策，港元利率將逐步亦回復至正常。 香港金管局重申，根據 LERS 的設計，資本外流、港元匯率走弱、觸發弱方聯繫匯率及貨幣基礎縮減，都是港元利率正常化的必要過程。 香港金管局也提醒公眾謹慎管理他們的風險，並為潛在的金融動盪做好準備。\n\n為加強貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將一特定部分外匯基金資產分配予背書貨幣基礎。背書比率，定義為背書資產除以貨幣基礎，於2017年期間在106.7–108.2%的範圍內波動，未有觸及上或下限觸發點。該比率於12月31日收報108.1%（圖5）。在應急貸款機制下，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產供背書投資組合使用，但所有外匯基金資產均不詳可用於支持香港的匯率。若發生突如其來的衝擊，外匯基金龐大的財政資源將提供強大的背靠，以保護香港的貨幣及金融穩定。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n貨幣發行委員會的委員會（貨幣發行委員會）監察並審閱有關香港貨幣及金融穩定的問題。 於2017年，貨幣發行委員會考慮了多個問題，包括香港房屋價格短期動能的驅動因素、HIBOR-倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）息差的決定因素、物業估值變動對內地企業借貸的影響，以及按揭債務償還負擔對香港消費的影響。 貨幣發行委員會就這些問題的討論紀錄以及提交給貨幣發行委員會的貨幣發行委員會營運報告，均在香港金融管理局網站上公布。\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行和金融領域的研究。過去三年，HKIMR 已更加強調其活動的政策相關性。這反映在它的會議活動和訪問學者計劃中，特別是這些方面。HKIMR 已與主要中央銀行和政策機構聯合舉辦更多政策相關的會議。同時，2016年推出的一項主題研究學者計劃，繼續支持更多與對香港金管局重要性的政策問題相關的研究項目。\n\n2017年，香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）接待了18位學者，並公布了29宗工作坊論文。在過去的一年內，中心亦舉辦了四項國際會議和工作坊：\n- 名為「中國經濟再平衡：將走向何方？」的第八輪年度國際中國經濟論壇於1月在香港舉辦。該論壇提供了一個平台，供學術界、政策制定者和業界專家討論與內地經濟相關的重要分析和政策問題。共有11宗高品質的研究論文現時，涵蓋了廣泛的議題，包括內地的經濟再平衡、結構性改革和國際溢出效應，以及內地的貨幣匯率和貨幣政策框架及傳導機制等問題。\n- 第15屆香港金融研究中心夏季工作坊於7月舉辦。工作坊旨在提供一個機會，讓香港金融研究中心和香港金管局的成員展示他們的論文，並提升研究人員與訪問學者之間的互動。\n- 香港金管局和國際金融情報委員會聯合舉辦的會議，名為「匯率的價格、真實影響和金融影響」，於8月舉辦。會議提供了一個深入且富有洞察力的討論平台。涵蓋了廣泛的重要主題，包括匯率制度、國際貿易的定價制度、累積外匯儲備中的風險採取，以及外匯市場行為。\n- 香港金管局、美國聯邦儲備委員會和亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行聯合贊助的會議，名為「非常規貨幣政策：經驗汲取」，於10月舉辦。該會議檢討了過去十年來主要央行對非常規貨幣政策（UMP）的經驗汲取。討論的主題包括低利率環境下的貨幣政策、UMP及其對新興經濟體的溢出效應、UMP與銀行貸款，以及UMP對實體經濟和金融穩定的影響。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nIn 2017, the HKMA continued to place its supervisory focus on the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ risk governance framework, including credit and liquidity risk management systems. During the year, another round of countercyclical macro-prudential measures was introduced to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector to cope with any downturn in the property market. With cyber threats on the rise, the HKMA stepped up the supervision of authorized institutions’ technology risk management. At the same time, the HKMA launched seven initiatives that prepare Hong Kong to move into a New Era of Smart Banking. The effectiveness of authorized institutions’ anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing controls remained a key supervisory focus of the HKMA as part of its efforts to combat financial crimes. On conduct supervision, the HKMA took further steps to promote a customer-centric corporate culture, foster financial inclusion, and address difficulties encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies in opening and maintaining bank accounts in Hong Kong. Efforts were also made to enhance the supervision of authorized institutions’ sales practices for investment and insurance products to further strengthen customer protection.\n\nSubstantial progress was made on the local implementation of international supervisory and accounting standards, including capital adequacy standards, disclosure standards, the Net Stable Funding Ratio, large exposure limits, recovery planning and International Financial Reporting Standard 9. In support of the need for capacity building amid an ever-changing banking environment and evolving risk landscape, the HKMA co-ordinated with the industry to develop director empowerment programmes and the Enhanced Competency Framework for banking practitioners.\n\nThe Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance came into operation on 7 July 2017, making Hong Kong one of the few Financial Stability Board member jurisdictions with a fully cross-sectoral resolution regime for financial institutions. The Ordinance, establishing a new line of defence for financial stability, confers necessary powers on the Monetary Authority to manage, in an orderly manner, failure of a financial institution in circumstances where such failure could have adverse systemic consequences.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe HKMA has a general objective to promote the safety and stability of the banking system. Achieving this objective is contingent upon the financial system being highly resilient and capable of providing the critical financial services the Hong Kong economy needs.\n\nBanks can affect the stability of the system through the way they carry out their business and, in extremis, by failing in a disorderly manner. The Monetary Authority, as a supervisory authority, plays a key role in safeguarding financial stability by ensuring banks are resilient to shocks and are able to recover their positions in response to crises, which ultimately helps prevent failures. The Monetary Authority is responsible for the prudential supervision of banking business, which includes the business of taking deposits, in Hong Kong. It is tasked with the authorization of licensed banks, restricted licence banks and deposittaking companies in Hong Kong, which are collectively known as authorized institutions (AIs). The Monetary Authority is also responsible for the designation and oversight of certain financial market infrastructures (FMIs).\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority cannot ensure, nor is the Hong Kong prudential regulatory framework designed to ensure, a zero-risk financial system. Instead, the Monetary Authority, as a resolution authority, seeks to ensure that in the event of an AI’s failure, resolution may be conducted in an orderly manner such that continuity in critical financial services provided by AIs to their customers can be maintained. To this end, a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong is established, under which the Monetary Authority is the resolution authority for AIs, amongst other financial institutions.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Overview of supervisory activities\n\nIn 2017, 192 off-site reviews were conducted covering a broad range of issues, including CAMEL ratings1, corporate governance, business operations and risk management of AIs. As part of the HKMA’s continued efforts to promote stronger risk governance at AIs, 30 meetings were held with the boards of directors or board-level committees of AIs, with the discussions focused on important risk management issues. The HKMA also conducted a survey to monitor the adoption of its recent guidance on corporate governance. 27 tripartite meetings among the HKMA, AIs and their external auditors were also held.\n\nApart from off-site activities, the HKMA continued to conduct regular on-site examinations supplemented with thematic reviews on areas assessed to be of higher risk. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks faced by AIs. The HKMA conducted 401 on-site examinations and thematic reviews during the year. Credit risk management and controls remained the key focus of these examinations and reviews. Another major focus was technology risk and operational risk management. The HKMA also increased the number of overseas examinations and the number of on-site examinations and thematic reviews targeted at liquidity and market risk management as well as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls. On-site examinations of AIs’ activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also conducted by specialist teams.\n\n# Supervision of credit risk\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nTotal bank lending grew by 16.1%, compared with a growth of 6.5% in 2016. As shown in Table 2, the loan growth was broad-based.\n\nSpecifically, Mainland-related lending grew by 17.5% to HK$4,188 billion at the end of 2017 (Table 3). This included HK$644 billion of loans booked with Mainland subsidiaries of banks incorporated in Hong Kong.\n\nThe asset quality of AIs remained healthy in 2017. Retail banks’ classified loan ratio edged down from 0.72% at the end of 2016 to 0.54% at the end of 2017, well below the long-run historical average of 2.2% since 2000. For the banking industry as a whole, the classified loan ratio decreased from 0.85% to 0.67%. As regards Mainlandrelated lending, retail banks’ classified loan ratio of such lending edged down to 0.75% in 2017 from 0.82%. For the banking industry as a whole, the ratio decreased to 0.67% from 0.80% a year ago.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts to ensure that AIs continued to adopt prudent credit risk management standards. In particular, the surveillance of AIs’ exposures to major corporates was enhanced. Targeted thematic examinations were conducted, focusing on key credit risk management controls such as loan underwriting standards, the loan classification and provisioning system, credit risk governance framework and risk management for lending to property developers, asset-backed financing and insurance premium financing.\n\n# Property mortgage lending\n\nProperty prices continued to rise in 2017. There were more loans extended by AIs involving borrowers with multiple mortgages or with income derived from outside of Hong Kong. In view of these developments, the HKMA introduced another round of countercyclical macroprudential measures on 19 May. The eighth round of measures included raising the risk-weight floor for the calculation of capital charges for new residential mortgage loans granted by AIs, lowering the applicable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers with pre-existing mortgages, and lowering the applicable debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit for property mortgage loans extended to borrowers whose income is derived mainly from outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA’s macro-prudential measures on property mortgage loans, introduced since 2009, have enhanced banks’ resilience to risks associated with the property market. The average LTV ratio of new residential mortgage loans fell to 49% in December 2017 from 64% in September 2009, before the countercyclical measures were first introduced. The average DSR also decreased to 35% in December 2017 from 41% in August 2010, when a cap on DSR was first applied (Chart 1).\n\nThe HKMA observed that some developers financed their property development projects with high gearing and some of them provided mortgages with high LTV ratios to buyers of properties. To address the risks associated with these developments, the HKMA introduced new risk management measures for lending to property developers on 12 May. These included requiring AIs to lower the financing caps for construction financing; requiring AIs to set aside more capital for their lending to property developers with a higher proportion of mortgage loans relative to equity; and performing a round of thematic examinations to ensure that banks continue to follow prudent underwriting standards in their lending to property developers.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA worked with the Land Registry in launching an e-Alert service in February. The e-Alert service provides a notification to the AI concerned whenever a further mortgage in respect of the mortgaged property is lodged with the Land Registry for registration, so that the mortgagee bank can take appropriate risk mitigating actions as appropriate.\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nCybersecurity threats continued to increase over the year. The HKMA stepped up its supervisory efforts in a bid to enhance the cyber resilience of the banking sector. As part of the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative (CFI) rolled out by the HKMA in 2016, 30 AIs completed an assessment of the maturity of their cyber defences. Separately, the HKMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), after extensive consultation with the banking and securities industry, jointly decided to introduce a mandatory twofactor authentication for online share trading. A round of on-site examinations focused on banks’ cybersecurity controls and operational resilience was also conducted. The HKMA further completed a round of discussions with the senior management of major banks to assess how the banks were managing strategic risks posed by potential new market entrants powered by technological advancement.\n\n# Smart Banking\n\nIn September, the HKMA announced a package of measures to assist Hong Kong’s banking sector in migrating to a new era of Smart Banking. On the supervisory front, the HKMA enhanced the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox to version 2.0, with new features including a Chatroom facility accessible by both banks and technology firms and the establishment of linkages among the sandboxes of the HKMA, the SFC and the Insurance Authority (IA), so as to provide a single point of entry for conducting trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nThe HKMA also launched a Banking Made Easy initiative to identify and minimise regulatory frictions with the aim of further improving customers’ experience in using fintech and digital banking services. A taskforce has been set up with the current focus on remote onboarding and account maintenance, online finance and online wealth management.\n\nA review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks has commenced to facilitate the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities and liquidity risk\n\nAs the US continued to normalise its monetary policy, global fund flows might become increasingly volatile. In consideration of this, the HKMA placed increased focus on the supervision of liquidity risk during the year. The HKMA enhanced its supervisory liquidity stress testing with additional scenarios, including a more stressful but plausible scenario of fund outflows and a short-term, confidencedriven bank run scenario. The HKMA also stepped up the monitoring and analysis of individual AIs’ liquidity profiles and required selected AIs to strengthen their liquidity risk management capability.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted more on-site examinations of AIs’ market risk management in respect of their debt securities portfolios. A round of thematic reviews were carried out to evaluate potential risks arising from AIs’ increased investment activities in foreign currency bonds and to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding risk management, including hedging practices.\n\n# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML\/TF)\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) (Amendment) Bill 2017 was gazetted on 23 June and will come into operation in 2018. The amendment is intended to update Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for AML\/CFT in line with the latest international requirements as promulgated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These changes, together with updates to the statutory guideline on AML\/CFT, will help clarify and implement the risk-based approach in customer due diligence (CDD) processes for account opening and the maintenance of bona fide customers, and encourage innovation where such processes are carried out

銀行穩定性\n\n在2017年，香港金管局繼續將監管重點放在持牌金融機構風險監管框架的有效性上，包括信貸和流動資金風險管理系統。在該年，採取了另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施，以鞏固銀行業應付物業市場任何逆轉的能力。隨著網絡威脅上升，香港金管局加強了對持牌金融機構科技風險管理的監管。與此同時，香港金管局推出七項舉動，為香港進入新紀元時期預備。持牌金融機構的打擊洗錢和反恐融資控制的有效性仍然是香港金管局監管重點的一部分，作為其打擊金融犯罪的努力。在行為監管方面，香港金管局採取了進一步的努力，以推動以客戶為中心的企業文化，促進金融普惠，並解決中小企業和初創公司在香港開設和維持銀行賬戶所遇到的困難。亦有努力提升對持牌金融機構投資和保險產品銷售行為的監管，以進一步鞏固客戶保護。\n\n重大進展已在本地取得，就落實國際監管及會計標準，包括資本充足標準、披露標準、淨平穩資金比率、大額風險限額、復甦計劃以及國際財務報告準則第9號。為支持在不斷變化的銀行環境和演進的生態下，能力建設的需求，金管局與業界協調，發展董事賦權計劃及為銀行從業員提升的勝任能力框架。\n\n金融機構（善後）條例於7月7日生效，使香港成為少數擁有全面跨行業金融機構善後制度的金融穩定理事會成員地區之一。 該條例確立了金融穩定的一項新主軸，賦予金融管理局必要權力，以有序方式管理金融機構在可能導致不利系統性後果的情況下的失敗運作。\n\n# 目標\n\n金管局的一項一般目標是推動銀行體系的安全與穩定。 取得此項目標取決於金融體系具備高度的承受衝擊能力，並且能夠提供香港經濟所需的關鍵金融服務。\n\n銀行可以透過其業務的經營方式影響系統的穩定性，在極端情況下，甚至可能因失序倒閉。 金融管理局作為監管機構，在維護金融穩定方面扮演著關鍵的地位，透過確保銀行具備強大的承受衝擊能力，並能在危機發生時恢復其地位，從而有助於避免失敗。 金融管理局肩負著對銀行業務的審慎監督，包括存款的採取業務，在香港。 其職責包括授權香港的持牌銀行、限制牌照銀行和存款吸收公司，這些共同稱為授權機構（AIs）。 金融管理局亦負責特定金融市場基礎設施（FMIs）的指定和監督。\n\n然而，金融管理局無法保證，香港的謹慎監管框架亦非為保證零風險的金融體系而設計。相反，金融管理局作為解決方案權威機構，致力於保證在認可機構出現問題的事件中，解決方案可 以有序地進行，以維持認可機構向其顧客提供的重要金融服務。為此，香港金融機構的解決方案制度已設立，根據該制度，金融管理局是認可機構等其他金融機構的解決方案權威機構。\n\n# 2017 回顧\n\n# 概覽 of supervisory activities\n\n在2017年，進行了涵蓋廣泛議題的192場離地審查，包括CAMEL評級1、公司治理、業務營運和人工智能的風險管理。作為香港金管局繼續努力推動人工智能的更強勁風險治理的其中一部分，舉辦了30場與人工智能董事會或董事會層級委員會的會議，討論重點是重要的風險管理議題。香港金管局亦進行了一項調查，以監察其近期關於公司治理的指引的採用。香港金管局、人工智能及其外部審計師之間亦舉辦了27場三方會議。\n\n除現場活動外，金管局繼續進行定期現場審查，輔以對評估為風險較高地區的專題審查。 這種方法容許金管局將監管資源優先用於重點關注人工智能面對的 emergent 且更顯著的風險。 金管局在該年進行了 401 項現場審查和專題審查。 信用風險管理與控制仍然是這些審查和評論的重點。 另一主要重點是科技風險和營運風險管理。 金管局亦增加了海外審查的數字，以及針對流動性及市場風險管理，以及打擊洗錢和資助恐怖主義 (AML\/CFT) 控制的現場審查和專題審查的數字。 針對證券、投資產品、保險和與強制性公積金 (MPF) 相關業務的人工智能活動的現場審查亦由專業團隊進行。\n\n# 信貸風險監控\n\n# 信貸增長與資產品質\n\n總體銀行貸款增長了16.1%，與2016年6.5%的增長相比。根據表2所載，貸款增長是廣泛的。\n\n具體而言，與內地相關的貸款增長了17.5%，截至2017年底達到4,188億港元（表3）。 其中包括644億港元，這些貸款已入帳至在香港註冊成立並在內地設有子公司之銀行。\n\n人工智能的資產品質在2017年仍然健康。零售銀行的不良貸款比率從2016年底的0.72%下降至2017年底的0.54%，遠低於自2000年以來長期歷史平均水平2.2%。就整個銀行業而言，不良貸款比率從0.85%下降至0.67%。至於與中國大陸相關的貸款，零售銀行此類貸款的不良貸款比率亦下降至2017年的0.75%，從一年前的0.80%。\n\n在該年，金管局加強了監管力度，以保證融資公司繼續採用審慎的信貸風險管理標準。特別是，加強了對融資公司向大型企業敞口的監察。進行了有針對性的主題審查，重點關注貸款承銷標準、貸款分類和備抵呆帳制度、信貸風險治理框架以及向地產商的貸款、資產擔保融資和保險保費融資等關鍵的信貸風險管理控制。\n\n# 物業按揭貸款\n\n物業價格於2017年繼續上升。有更多由金融機構發放的貸款，涉及有多重按揭或收入得出於香港以外的借款人。鑒於這些發展，金管局於5月19日推出另一輪逆周期宏觀審慎措施。第八輪措施包括提高金融機構為新的住宅按揭貸款計算資本充足率的風險加權底線，降低適用於已存在按揭的借款人的物業按揭貸款的貸款成數上限，以及降低適用於主要收入得出於香港以外的借款人的物業按揭貸款的債務償還比率上限。\n\n金管局自2009年起推出的物業按揭貸款的宏觀審慎措施，提升了銀行應對房地產市場相關風險的能力。新住宅按揭貸款的平均貸款價值比率，於2017年12月跌至49%，較2009年9月64%為低，在反周期措施首度推出的時候。平均負債收入比率亦下降至2017年12月的35%，較2010年8月41%為低，當時首次應用了負債收入比率的第上限（圖1）。\n\n金管局見到部分地產商利用較高比率的負 leverage 為其物業發展項目 финансирование，並且向物業買家提供按揭，其按揭貸款與股本的比例較高。為解決與這些發展相關的風險，金管局於5月12日推出新的風險管理措施，適用於向地產商的貸款。這些措施包括要求牌照銀行降低建築融資的上限；要求牌照銀行為其向地產商的貸款，特別是按揭貸款比例較高時，撥出更多資本；以及進行一輪主題審查，以保證銀行在向地產商的貸款中繼續跟進審慎的承保標準。\n\n另一方面，認可機構與土地註冊處合作開展了一個電子提醒服務，於2月推出。這個電子提醒服務選持在抵押物上另有抵押權設定時，向相關認可機構提供通知，以便抵押銀行可採取適當的風險緩解行動。\n\n# 營運與科技風險的監督\n\n網絡安全威脅在當年持續上升。香港金管局加強了其監管努力，旨在提升銀行業的網絡韌性。作為香港金管局於2016年推出嘅網絡安全強化倡議 (CFI)，30間人工智能公司完成咗對佢哋網絡防禦期滿嘅評估。另一方面，香港金管局同證券及期貨事務監察委員會 (SFC)，經過廣泛諮詢銀行同證券行業後，聯合決定推出網上股份交易嘅強制性雙重認證。一輪專注於銀行網絡安全控制措施同營運韌性的現場審查亦有進行。香港金管局進一步完成咗一輪同主要銀行高級管理層嘅討論，以評估銀行點樣管理潛在嘅新市場參與者帶嚟嘅策略風險，呢啲參與者由科技推動。\n\n# 智慧銀行\n\n9月，香港金管局宣布一包措施，以協助香港的銀行業邁入智慧銀行的新紀元。在監管方面，香港金管局提升了金融科技監管沙盒至2.0版本，新增功能包括銀行和科技公司均可使用的聊天室設施，以及在香港金管局、證券及期貨事務執行委員會（SFC）和保險監理處（IA）的沙盒之間設立連結，藉此提供一個單一的重點進入點，以便進行跨行業金融科技產品的試驗。\n\n香港金管局亦推出「銀行輕鬆辦」 initiative，旨在識別及減低監管障礙，以提升顧客使用金融科技及數碼銀行服務的經驗。現時，一個工作小組已獲設立，重點關注遠程開戶及賬戶維護、網上金融及網上財富管理。\n\n現已開始審閱有關虛擬銀行授權的現有指引，以促進在香港推出虛擬銀行服務。\n\n# 庫務活動監控與流動性風險管理\n\n隨著我們繼續回復至正常貨幣政策，全球資金流動性可能會日益波動。 鑒此，香港金管局在當年重點關注流動風險的監管。香港金管局亦提升了其監管流動性壓力測試，加入了增發情景，包括一個更具壓力但合理的資金流出情景，以及一個短期、信心驅動的銀行擠兌情景。香港金管局加強了對個別牌照行的流動性狀況的監察與分析，並規定部分牌照行鞏固其流動風險管理能力。\n\n另一方面，金管局進行了更多對虛擬資產交易商市場風險管理方面的現場審查，涉及他們的債務證券投資組合。進行了一輪主題審查，以評估虛擬資產交易商在海外貨幣債券投資活動上升所帶來的潛在風險，並評估相應風險管理的有效性，包括對沖措施。\n\n# 預防洗錢和 терроризм 融資 (ML\/TF)\n\n防止洗錢及打擊恐怖分子融資（金融機構）（修訂）條例（2017年）於6月23日刊憲，並將於2018年生效。此修訂旨在根據金融行動工作組織（FATF）頒佈的最新國際要求，更新香港的AML\/CFT監管制度。 這些變動，以及對AML\/CFT法定指引的更新，將有助釐清及落實在客戶盡職審查（CDD）流程中，為開戶及維護顧客的風險為本的方法，並鼓勵在遙距運作的流程中進行創新。\n"}

Hong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, thanks to a series of efforts on network and capacity building on this front. The launch of Bond Connect reinforced Hong Kong’s position as the main gateway to opportunities in Mainland China. The HKMA’s efforts on other areas such as corporate treasury centres were also bearing fruits.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nIn view of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced the launch of seven initiatives to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. These initiatives included:\n- developing the Faster Payment System (FPS) to achieve full connectivity of digital retail payments;\n- introducing an Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) framework;\n- enhancing fintech research and talent development;\n- stepping up cross-border collaboration in fintech;\n- upgrading our existing Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) 1.0 to Version 2.0;\n- facilitating the introduction of virtual banking; and\n- promoting a new Banking Made Easy initiative to minimise regulatory frictions in customers’ digital experience.\n\nThe HKMA Fintech Facilitation Office (FFO), together with the banking departments of the HKMA, played a pivotal role in driving the implementation of these initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech hub in Asia.\n\nHong Kong’s international profile as a financing hub for infrastructure investments was raised further, as the number of partners of the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) grew to 87 as at 31 January 2018 from about 40 at inception. During the year, IFFO organised and participated in more than 10 seminars and workshops to facilitate experience sharing and collaborative networking among key stakeholders. In particular, IFFO steered the development of an infrastructure equity investment reference term sheet in its inaugural Debt Financing and Investors’ Roundtables with a view to enhancing infrastructure projects’ bankability and investability.\n\nBond Connect was launched in July, marking another major milestone in mutual access between the Hong Kong and Mainland capital markets, and further solidifying our gateway position for international investors seeking to enter the Mainland market. During the year, Hong Kong’s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota was increased to RMB500 billion from RMB270 billion. Hong Kong maintained the world’s largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, with vibrant renminbi financial intermediation activities as evidenced by a high turnover of our renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s renminbi payment activities in the world.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tax regime for corporate treasury centres (CTCs) in 2016, the HKMA stepped up its outreach efforts with a view to attracting more multinational corporates to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong. By the end of 2017, more than 40 corporates reflected to the HKMA that they were actively planning to set up, or had set up, treasury centre operations in Hong Kong.\n\nThe HKMA actively contributed to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. The Chief Executive of the HKMA became the Chair of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Co-operation (SRC) of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)1 in April to lead discussions on key financial stability issues.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre and global offshore renminbi business hub. The four interbank RTGS systems and the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) achieved 100% system availability in 2017, as compared to the target of 99.95%. To support Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, CMU has set up accounts with the two Mainland central securities depositories (CSDs) to facilitate the settlement of Bond Connect transactions and holding of Mainland debt securities on behalf of relevant CMU members.\n\nTo promote the general safety and efficiency of the local retail payment industry, the HKMA designated four retail payment systems (RPSs) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO) in August to bring their operations under the HKMA’s oversight. The HKMA also conducted supervision of 16 stored value facility (SVF) licensees which actively launched new products and services that sought to offer customers more choices and better user experience. Separately, the coverage of e-Cheque and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) service was further expanded to include crossboundary payments between Hong Kong and the entire Guangdong Province.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2017\n\n# Hong Kong as a fintech hub in Asia\n\n# Smart Banking Initiatives\n\nIn light of the rapid technological advancements, the HKMA in September announced seven initiatives that would prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The initiatives aimed to help the banking sector to rise to a higher level and embrace the enormous opportunities brought about by the convergence of banking and technology.\n\n“Smart Banking would offer full interconnectivity amongst retail and corporate customers and allow financial services and transactions to be undertaken with great mobility, speed, ease and safety.”\n\nThe HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry and the fintech community, and made good progress in implementing the seven initiatives.\n\n# Faster Payment System\n\nThe FPS is a multi-currency platform that would enable the public to make round-the-clock funds transfers in a real-time manner with ease, through using mobile phone numbers or email addresses. It can support payments in Hong Kong dollars and renminbi. Banks and non-bank payment service providers can participate in the FPS, enabling full connectivity among all payment participants. With system development work close to completion, the FPS is scheduled to launch in September 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the HKMA led a working group, comprising major credit card scheme operators, banks, licensed SVF operators and merchant acquirers, to establish a common QR code standard for retail payments in Hong Kong. A common QR code standard would facilitate merchants in using a single QR code to accept QR code payment solutions from multiple payment service providers, providing greater convenience to customers and merchants. The working group has finalised the relevant technical specification, and would work out the implementation arrangements.\n\n# Open Application Programming Interface\n\nOpen API allows banks’ data to be accessed by third parties to facilitate better and easier integration of services offered by banks and other industries. Users can therefore conveniently stay on one system to enjoy integrated services in a secure environment. To facilitate the development and adoption of Open API by the banking sector, the HKMA has come up with a draft Open API framework, comprising a selection of Open API functions and deployment time frame, technical standards, third-party service provider governance, facilitation measures and maintenance models, for a two-month industry consultation.\n\n# Research and talent development\n\nOne of the major research projects was on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Following the first DLT whitepaper in 2016, the second whitepaper on DLT was published in October 2017. The second whitepaper further explores the three Proof-of-Concept works, namely trade finance, digital identity management and mortgage application. It also offers advice on the implementation issues relating to governance, legal and compliance, and general control principles on deploying DLT for the banking and payment industries.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan, announces the release of the second whitepaper on DLT at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nRiding on the success of the Proof-of-Concept work on trade finance led by the HKMA, seven banks in Hong Kong decided to commercialise the prototype into a production system named Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform (HKTFP) to digitise and share trade documents and automate processes with a view to improving the overall trade process and reducing risks and fraud in the trade finance business.\n\nIn an effort to enlarge the talent pool in the fintech industry, the HKMA launched the Fintech Career Accelerator Scheme in collaboration with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute in December 2016. Response from students was positive. More than 3,000 applications from 421 applicants were received. Finally, 74 students accepted internship offers from the HKMA and 12 banks to work on fintech-related projects for six months or one year starting from July.\n\n# Cross-border collaboration\n\nAs the first step of strengthening our collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area, we are partnering with Shenzhen to promote fintech and talent developments. Specifically, the HKMA and the Office of Financial Development Service, the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality (OFDS) entered into an agreement in June to (i) provide reciprocal soft-landing support for fintech firms, (ii) co-organise the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award in October to recognise and reward outstanding fintech products and solutions in the two cities; and (iii) arrange summer internships at Shenzhen fintech and techfin firms for Hong Kong students.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (middle), signs and exchanges Memoranda of Understanding on softlanding arrangements with OFDS Director-General, Mr He Xiaojun (left), and Cyberport Chairman, Dr Lee George Lam, at the HKMA Fintech Day.\n\nE-leaflet for the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Fintech Award.\n\nThe HKMA also signed fintech co-operation agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority on innovation projects, referrals of innovative businesses, information sharing and exchange of expertise.\n\nIn November, the HKMA further signed a Memorandum of Understanding with MAS to jointly build the Global Trade Connectivity Network (GTCN), which would connect Singapore’s National Trade Platform to the HKTFP to form a cross-border DLT infrastructure in order to digitalise cross-border trade and trade finance processes, making them safer, more efficient and costeffective. It will be an open platform that allows other interested jurisdictions to participate in the future. The GTCN is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n# Fintech Supervisory Sandbox\n\nThe FSS launched by the HKMA in September 2016 was upgraded to FSS 2.0 to expedite communication with banks and tech firms to facilitate new ideas and initiatives. Specifically, FSS 2.0 has the following new features:\n- A Fintech Supervisory Chatroom is set up to provide feedback to banks and tech firms at an early stage of their fintech projects.\n- Tech firms can access the FSS by seeking feedback from the Chatroom without going through a bank.\n- The sandboxes of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Insurance Authority are linked up so that there is a single point of entry for pilot trials of cross-sector fintech products.\n\nAs of end-2017, 28 new technology products have been tested in the FSS. Out of these cases, 14 pilot trials have been completed, and the relevant products have been rolled out to the market subsequently.\n\n# Banking Made Easy initiative\n\nA Banking Made Easy initiative was launched to minimise regulatory frictions hindering technological innovations. A taskforce has been set up with current focus on the following areas:\n- Remote onboarding and account maintenance\n- Online finance\n- Online wealth management\n\n# Virtual Banking\n\nVirtual banks, which operate without physical branches, are expected to provide additional impetus to the application of fintech in Hong Kong and offer a new kind of customer experience in mobile and digital banking. They may also help promote financial inclusion as they normally target the retail segment, be they individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The HKMA has commenced the review of the existing Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks with a view to facilitating the introduction of virtual banking in Hong Kong.\n\n# A New Era of Smart Banking\n\n# Supervision and Innovation\n\nThe seven initiatives unveiled by the HKMA last year to prepare Hong Kong for a new era of Smart Banking are a large-scale project involving cooperation among various departments within the HKMA. With fintech becoming an unstoppable force, Mr Raymond Chan, Executive Director (Banking Supervision) of the HKMA, indicated that the HKMA, as a regulator, must embrace this new trend by keeping abreast of the latest technological developments and adjusting its supervisory mindset and approach as appropriate, in order to take bank services and customer experience to a new

國際金融中心\n\n為鞏固香港的地位作為國際金融中心，香港金管局致力提升香港金融平台的競爭力。在金融科技方面，旨在促進銀行和支付行業金融科技發展及使用的七項新規劃，經持份者和公眾的歡迎。香港作為基礎建設投資融資中心的國際形象亦得到提升， وذلك 歸功於在該領域的一連串努力，包括網絡和能力建設。債券通的推出鞏固了香港作為通往內地機遇的 主要門戶的地位。香港金管局在其他地區的努力亦正在開花結果。\n\n# 概覽\n\n鑒於快速的科技進 advancements，金管局在9月宣布推出七項舉動，以預備香港邁入智慧銀行的新紀元。這些舉動包括：\n- 開展快速支付系統 (FPS) 以爭取數位零售支付的十足連繫；\n- 推出開放應用程式介面 (Open API) 框架；\n- 加強金融科技研究和人才開展；\n- 提升跨境金融科技合作；\n- 將現有的金融科技監管沙盒 (FSS) 1.0 升級至 2.0 版本；\n- 促進虛擬銀行業的推出；以及\n- 推動新的銀行輕鬆 (Banking Made Easy) 倡議，以減低顧客數位經驗中的監管摩擦。\n\n香港金融管理局金融科技促進辦公室（FFO），與香港金融管理局的銀行部門一同發揮了樞紐地位，推動落實這些舉措，以鞏固香港的地位，使其成為亞洲金融科技樞紐。\n\n香港作為基礎設施投資融資樞紐的國際形象得到進一步提升，截至2018年1月31日，香港金管局基礎設施融資促進辦公室（IFFO）的夥伴數字增長至87個，而創辦時約為40個。在當年，IFFO舉辦並參與了超過10場研討會和工作坊，以促進持份者之間的經驗分享和合作聯繫。特別是，IFFO推動了在首屆債務融資與投資者圓桌會議上，基礎設施股本投資參考文件草案的發展，旨在加強基礎設施項目可貸性和可投資性。\n\n互聯互通於7月推出，標誌著香港與內地資本市場互惠互利的另一重要里程碑，並進一步鞏固了我們作為國際投資者進入內地市場的門戶地位。在過去的一年，香港的人民幣合格境外機構投資者（RQFII）配額已從270億元人民幣上升至5,000億元人民幣。香港維持了全球最大規模的人民幣離岸流動性池，憑藉我們的人民幣即時總額結算系統的高成交量以及全球範圍內香港人民幣支付活動的最大股份，展現了暢旺的人民幣金融中介活動。\n\n繼推出企業財資中心（CTCs）的稅務制度於2016年後，香港金管局加強了其外展努力，旨在吸引更多跨國企業在香港設立財資中心。截至2017年底，超過40%的企業向香港金管局反映，它們正積極計劃設立，或已設立財資中心業務於香港。\n\n香港金管局積極貢獻於國際社會對全球及區域金融穩定重要性議題的討論。香港金管局總裁於4月成為金融穩定理事會（金融穩定理事會）監管合作常設委員會的委員主席，以帶領就關鍵金融穩定議題進行討論。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及快捷運作，為香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位奠定了紥實的根基。 2017年，四宗銀行間即時轉賬系統及中央貨幣市場單位的運作，取得100%的系統可用性，較原定目標99.95%為高。為支持債券通北向交易，中央貨幣市場單位已在兩間內地中央證券登記機構設立賬戶，以促進債券通交易的結算，並代表有關中央貨幣市場單位成員持有內地的債務證券。\n\n為推動本地零售支付產業的 一般 效率與安全，金管局於 8月 指定 4宗 零售支付系統 (RPSs) 於《支付條例》下，將其營運納入金管局的 監督。 金管局 亦 進行 對 16 名 儲值機構牌照持有人的監督，他們 積極 推出 新產品及服務，旨在 帶來 更多 選擇予 顧客，並提供 理想 的使用者 經驗。 另一方面，電子支票 及 電子帳單呈現及支付 (EBPP) 服務的 覆蓋 範圍進一步 擴展，以 包含 香港與全部 廣東省 的跨境支付。\n\n# 2017 回顧\n\n# 香港作為亞洲金融科技中心\n\n# 智慧銀行方案\n\n鑒於快速的科技發展情況下，香港金管局在9月宣布了七項舉動，旨在預備香港邁入智慧銀行業的新紀元。這些舉動旨在幫助銀行業上升至較高水平，並把握科技與銀行融合所帶來龐大的機遇。\n\n智慧銀行會帶來顧客之間十足的互相連繫，並允許金融服務和交易以重大流動性、速度、緩和和安全性來執行。\n\n金管局一直與銀行業和金融科技社群密切工作，並在實施七項先導計劃方面取得好進展。\n\n# 加快付款系統\n\n快速支付系統是一個多幣種平台，會讓公眾能夠使用手機號碼或電子郵件地址，以一種緩和的方式，全天候進行即時資金轉賬。它可支援以香港美元和人民幣付款。銀行和非銀行支付服務提供者都可以參與快速支付系統，讓所有支付參與者位居…前列的連繫。隨著系統開發工作接近完成，快速支付系統預定於2018年9月推出。\n\n此外，香港金管局牽頭組成了一個工作小組，成員包括主要的信用卡發卡機構、銀行、持牌 SVF 提供者和商戶收單行，旨在為香港的零售支付建立一個通用的二維碼標準。 通用的二維碼標準會促進商戶使用單一二維碼接受來自多家支付提供者的二維碼支付解決方案，提供更大的便利給顧客和商戶。 這個工作小組已經最終確定了有關的技術規格，並且會制定落實安排。\n\n# 開放應用程式介面\n\n開放API 讓銀行數據可供第三方存取，以促進理想且更易於銀行及其他行業服務的融入。 用戶因此可方便地停留在 一 個系統上，享受 安全 的 融入式服務。 為促進銀行業對開放API 的發展及 採用，香港金管局制定了開放API 框架草案，當中包含 一 系列開放API 職能、部署 時間 框架、技術標準、第三方服務供應商監管、促進 措施及維護模式，以供為期 兩 個月的業界諮詢。\n\n# 研究與人才發展\n\n一項主要的研究項目是關於分散式賬本技術 (DLT)。繼2016年首份 DLT 白皮書後，於10月2017年公布了第二份 DLT 白皮書。第二份白皮書進一步探討了三項概念驗證工作，分別是貿易融資、數字身份管理和按揭申請。它亦提供了關於治理、法律及合規，以及部署 DLT 給銀行和支付產業的通用控制原則的落實意見。\n\n香港金管局首席行政總裁陳先生，宣布於香港金管局金融科技日發布關於區塊鏈技術的第二白皮書。\n\n憑藉香港金管局主導的貿易融資概念驗證項目的成功，香港七家銀行決定將原型商業化，打造名為香港貿易融資平台（HKTFP）的生產系統，以數碼化方式處理貿易文件，並分享股份，同時自動化流程，旨在提升整體貿易流程，並降低貿易融資業務中的風險和欺詐。\n\n為擴大金融科技行業的人才儲備，香港金管局於2016年12月與香港應用科技研究院合作推出金融科技職業加速計劃。計劃收到學生們的正面呼應。共有超過3,000份申請，來自421名申請者。最終，74名學生接受了香港金管局和12間銀行的實習機會，從7月開始，為期6個月或一年的金融科技相關項目而努力。\n\n# 跨境合作\n\n為加強粵港澳大灣區合作的首要步驟，我們將與深圳攜手推動金融科技及人才發展。 具體而言，香港金融管理局與深圳市人民政府金融發展服務辦公室（OFDS）於6月簽訂協議，(i) 提供金融科技企業互惠的軟著陸支持；(ii) 舉辦10月深圳市-香港金融科技獎，以表彰和獎勵兩地卓越的金融科技產品及方案；及(iii) 為香港學生安排在深圳金融科技及科技金融企業的暑期實習。\n\n金管局首席行政總裁陳先生（中），於金管局金融科技日簽署並交換關於軟落地安排的諒解備忘錄，與中國銀行保險監督管理委員會主任何曉軍先生（左）及數碼港主席李卓人博士。\n\n深圳-香港金融科技獎的電子傳單。\n\n金管局亦簽署了與新加坡金融管理局（MAS）及杜拜金融服務管理局的金融科技合作協議，內容涵蓋創新專案、創新企業推薦、分享資訊及交流專業知識，並促進運作。\n\n11月，香港金管局進一步與新加坡金融管理局簽署諒解備忘錄，聯合打造全球貿易連繫網絡（GTCN），將新加坡國家貿易平台與香港貿易金融平台連接起來，以建立跨境區塊鏈技術基礎設施，以便將跨境貿易和貿易融資流程數位化，使其更安全、更快捷且更具成本效益。 這個平台將會是一個開放的平台，允許其他感興趣的地區參與未來。 預計GTCN將於2019年首個四分之一推出。\n\n# 金融科技監管沙盒\n\n香港金管局於2016年9月推出的FSS，已升級至FSS 2.0，以促進與銀行和科技公司的溝通，並促進新點子和舉措。 具體而言，FSS 2.0具有以下新功能：\n- 設立了一個金融科技監管聊天室，以便在金融科技項目早期階段向銀行和科技公司提供意見。\n- 科技公司可以透過向聊天室尋求意見，未有經過銀行即可進入FSS。\n- 香港金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（SFC）和保險監理處的沙盒互相聯匯，以便於跨行業金融科技產品的試點實驗設立單一的進入點。\n\n截至2017年底，財政司轄下機構已考驗了28項新技術產品。在這些宗產品中，有14%的試點項目已完成，隨後將有關產品推出市場。\n\n# 銀行服務取得便利化方案\n\n一項「銀行輕鬆辦理」倡議已推出，旨在減低阻礙科技創新的監管摩擦。 一項工作小組已設立，現時的重點關注以下地區：\n- 遠程客戶入職及戶口維護\n- 網上金融\n- 網上財富管理\n\n#

{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\nThe global economy and financial markets performed better than expected in 2017. Global equity markets went up on the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks. While the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October, the 10- Year US Treasury yield remained stable and the US dollar weakened (rather than strengthened) against other major currencies. Under such a favourable environment, the Exchange Fund’s investment income reached a record high of HK$264 billion in 2017, representing an investment return of 7.4%.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure the entire Monetary Base, at all times, is fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure sufficient liquidity is available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a)–(c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the Fund’s long-term purchasing power.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios: the Backing Portfolio (BP) and the Investment Portfolio (IP). The BP holds highly liquid US dollardenominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The IP is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investments, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a wider variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and real estate. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the IP, while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the market value of investments under the LTGP is set at onethird of the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund, with further capacity arising from the allocation of part of the Future Fund to long-term assets.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Placements with the Exchange Fund\n\nThe Exchange Fund, from time to time, accepts placements by fiscal reserves, Government funds and statutory bodies. The interest rate is generally linked to the performance of the IP1, with the exception of the Future Fund which links its interest rate to both the IP and the LTGP depending on the portfolio mix. As at the end of 2017, the portfolio mix of the Future Fund between the IP and the LTGP was about 65:35. The portion of the Future Fund linked with the LTGP is expected to gradually build up to around 50% by 2018.\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation: the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This means the actual allocation is often different from the benchmark, or strategic allocation. The differences between the actual and benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and tracking error limit are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions and allowable ranges for tactical deviations are made and set by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the ranges allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage about 73% of the investments of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire BP and part of the IP. This part of the IP includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers to manage about 27% of the Exchange Fund’s assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised asset classes. The purpose of engaging external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture sustainable returns, to benefit from diverse and complementary investment styles and to share market insights and technical expertise with the Exchange Fund.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets subsequent to the 2008\/09 global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk assessment has been strengthened to support the Exchange Fund’s increased pace of investment diversification. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. Detailed performance attribution analyses are also conducted to identify sources of performance, allowing the HKMA to make the best use of the investment skills of internal and external managers.\n\n# Responsible investment\n\nThe HKMA is supportive of responsible investment. For instance, the HKMA supports the Principles of Responsible Ownership issued by the Securities and Futures Commission on 7 March 2016, which are voluntary and help investors determine how best to meet their ownership responsibilities in relation to their investments in Hong Kong-listed companies. For the management of the Exchange Fund, the HKMA has encouraged the appointed external fund managers for its Hong Kong equity portfolio to adopt the Principles of Responsible Ownership in managing the investments. Furthermore, the front offices and the Risk Management and Compliance Division have incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into various internal procedures for making and monitoring investment activities. The HKMA will closely monitor the development of ESG standards and assess how these standards can be further integrated into the investment process.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2017\n\nThe global economy and financial markets in 2017 performed better than expected. On the back of synchronised economic growth in major developed and emerging market economies, strong corporate earnings, and market expectation of slow and gradual tightening of monetary policies by major central banks, the global equity markets performed well. In particular, the Hong Kong equity market rose by 36%, outperforming other major equity markets.\n\nIn the bond markets, short-dated US Treasury yields shot up as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times as expected, and began to reduce its balance sheet in October. Nevertheless, the 10-year US Treasury yield remained stable at about 2.4% over the year. Other major 10-Year government bond yields also ended the year little changed, with the exception of German Bunds which rose on the euro area’s solid economic growth and market expectation of the European Central Bank’s policy tightening.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, despite the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and the beginning of its balance sheet reduction. The depreciation of the US dollar was a result of the reviving economic growth in Europe and Japan, and market expectation of diminishing monetary policy divergence between the US and other major economies. The euro and yen appreciated by around 14% and 4% respectively against the US dollar in 2017.\n\nThe performance of major currencies as well as bond and equity markets in 2017 is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 2017 market returns\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nThe Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$264 billion in 2017. This comprised gains of HK$80.4 billion on overseas equities, gains of HK$58.3 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$34.4 billion on bonds, a positive currency translation effect of HK$53.5 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$37.4 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$4.5 billion.\n\nThe investment income of HK$264 billion last year is a record high for the Exchange Fund, surpassing the previous record in 2007 (HK$142.2 billion) by HK$121.8 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$4,015.3 billion at year end. The market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$235.6 billion, with private equity amounting to HK$157.2 billion and real estate at HK$78.4 billion. Outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$162.4 billion.\n\nThe investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2017 was 7.4%. Specifically, the IP achieved a rate of return of 12.1%, while the BP gained 1.8%. The LTGP recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 13.7% since its inception in 2009.\n\nThe annual return of the Exchange Fund from 1994 to 2017 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2017 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over several different time horizons. The average return was 2.9% over the past three years, 2.5% over the past five years, 2.2% over the past ten years and 4.9% since 1994.

儲備管理\n\n全球經濟和金融市場在2017年表現理想，超出預期。 全球股票市場造好，背靠主要已開發和新興市場經濟體的同步增長、強勁的公司盈利，以及市場預期主要央行將逐步收緊貨幣政策。 儘管美國聯邦儲備局如預期般提升了三次利率，並開始在10月收縮其資產負債表，但10年期美國國債殖利率仍然平穩，美元兌其他主要貨幣回落（不...反而加強）。 在如此有利的環境下，匯儲基金的投資收入在2017年達到了紀錄新高，為2,640億香港元，代表投資回報為7.4%。\n\n# 基金交換\n\n匯豐基金的 主要 目標， 訂立於匯豐基金條例中，是直接或間接 影響 香港 的 貨幣 價值。 基金 亦 可 動用 以 保持 香港 的 貨幣 及 金融 系統 的 健全， 幫助 保持 香港 作為 國際 金融 中心。 匯豐基金 由 財政司長 控制， 並可在 諮詢 匯豐基金 諮詢 委員會 (EFAC) 後， 投資於 證券 或 其他 他 認為 適當 的 資產。\n\n# 基金管理\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合架構\n\nEFAC 已經設立以下投資目標予投資基金：\n(a) 保障資本；\n(b) 保證全部貨幣基礎，在任何時候，均有高度流通性極高的以美元為記帳貨幣的資產支持；\n(c) 保證有足夠的流通性，以幫助維持貨幣和金融穩定；及\n(d) 在前提下，根據 (a) 至 (c)，爭取一項能幫助保障基金長期實力 的投資回報。\n\n這些目標選持了聯邦基金法定目的的十足考慮，並融入了基金的投資組合架構和目標資產配置中。\n\n大致來說，外匯基金擁有兩項主要的投資組合：還款投資組合（BP）和投資投資組合（IP）。BP 持有流通性極高的 美元計價資產，以保障貨幣基礎，這是在貨幣司安排下所要求的。IP 主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國家的債券和股票市場，以保障資產的價值和長期 實力。\n\n為更好地管理風險並提升長期回報，香港金管局已在謹慎且循序漸進的方式下，將部分投資基金的投資分散到多元化的資產類別中，包括新興市場及內地的債券和股票、私募股權及房地產。新興市場及內地的債券和股票由投資工具計劃持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長投資組合（LTGP）持有。長期增長投資組合（LTGP）下投資的市值上限已設立於投資基金累積盈餘的三分之一，而未來基金的一部分撥款用於長期資產，將會產生額外容量。\n\n戰略投資組合，於2007年設立，目的是購入香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，為外匯基金的策略目的而購入，由於此投資組合的獨特性質，並未包括在基金投資表現的評估中。\n\n# 與投資基金的存款\n\n外匯基金不時接受財政儲備、政府基金和法定機構的存款。利率一般聯匯於IP1的表現，但未來基金的利率則視乎投資組合配置，同時聯匯於IP及長期政府應急基金。截至2017年底，未來基金在IP及長期政府應急基金的投資組合配置約為65：35。預期未來基金與長期政府應急基金聯網的部分將逐步增加，約於2018年達到50%。\n\n# 投資流程\n\n匯基金的投資過程因...而提升於兩類資產分布的決定：戰略性資產分布和短期資產分布。戰略性資產分布，反映於投資標的，代表匯基金投資目標的長期最佳資產分布，鑑於此。在戰略性分布的指導下，資產會戰略性地選持，以爭取在標的之上取得額外回報。這意味著實際的分布往往與標的或戰略性分布不同。實際與標的分布之間的差距稱為“短期偏離”。雖然金融司與匯金局諮詢委員會（EFAC）會定出標的和追蹤誤差限額，但短期決策和容許的短期偏離範圍是由香港金管局在授權下設立和決定。在容許的短期偏離範圍內，投資組合經理可以選持以利用短期市場走勢。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n金管局儲備管理部人員直接管理聯邦匯款基金的全部投資約73%，當中包括BP的全部以及IP的部分。這部分IP包括一系列投資於全球固定收益市場的投資組合，以及多個實施宏觀風險管理策略的衍生工具投資組合。\n\n# 使用外部管理員\n\n此外，除了內部管理資產外，金管局僱用外部基金經理管理約27%的投資基金資產，包括其所有上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產類別。僱用外部經理的目的是運用市場上不詳的最佳投資專業知識，以捕捉可持續的回報，並受惠於多元和互補的投資方式，以及與投資基金分享心得和技術專業知識。\n\n有關使用外部經理的管理支出，包括基金管理費及保管費、交易成本，以及預扣及其他稅款。此項支出主要由市場因素定出，且可能不同於年年。\n\n# 風險管理與合規\n\n全球金融危機後，金融市場的新高波動性突顯了風險管理的重要性。已為內部和外圍方面管理的投資組合設立了嚴格的控制和投資指引，並密切監察指引和法規的遵守情況。風險評估已加強，以支持投資組合多元化的步伐上升。風險控制工具被採用，以評估正常和不利市場狀況下的市場風險。詳細的績效歸因分析亦被進行，以識別績效的資料來源，讓香港金管局能讓內部和外部經理的最佳投資技能得到使用。\n\n# 肩負投資\n\n香港金管局支持負責任投資。例如，香港金管局支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會於2016年3月7日發行之負責任擁有權原則，此原則為自願性質，有助投資者釐定如何應對他們在香港上市之公司的投資擁有權責任。為管理投資基金，香港金管局已鼓勵委聘的外部基金經理，就其香港股票投資組合，採用負責任擁有權原則。此外，前線部門及風險管理及合規監察部已將環境、社會及管治（ESG）因素融入多個內部程序，以進行投資活動的審批及監察。香港金管局將密切監察ESG標準的發展，並評估如何將此等標準進一步融入投資流程。\n\n# 基金表現\n\n# 2017年的金融市場\n\n二零一七年全球經濟和金融市場表現理想於預期之上。 由於主要已開發和新興市場經濟體同步經濟增長、企業盈利強勁，以及市場預期主要央行將逐步收緊貨幣政策，全球股票市場表現亦理想。 特別是，香港股票市場上升了百分之三十六，出色於其他主要股票市場。\n\n在債券市場上，短期美國國庫券收益飆升，因為美國聯邦儲備局如預期般提升了利率三次，並在10月開始收縮其資產負債表。然而，10年期美國國庫券收益仍然維持在約2.4%的平穩水平。其他主要10年期政府公債收益在年內不大變動，例外的是德國國債，因歐元範疇的紥實經濟增長以及歐洲央行政策收緊的預期而上升。\n\n在貨幣市場上，美元對其他主要貨幣回落，儘管美國聯邦儲備局的加息以及其資產負債表縮減開始。美元的下跌造成了歐洲和日本經濟回升，以及市場預期美國與其他主要經濟體之間的貨幣政策收窄。 歐元和日圓分別對美元在2017年升值約14%和4%。\n\n二零一七年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現，表一所載。\n\n表 2017 年市場回報\n\n# 聯匯基金的表現\n\n外匯基金錄得2,640億香港元於2017年的投資回報。這包括海外股票回報804億香港元、香港股票回報583億香港元、債券回報344億香港元、非香港元資產正面匯率上調回報535億香港元，以及外匯基金投資控股附屬機構持有的其他投資回報374億香港元。 另一方面，戰略投資組合錄得估值回報45億香港元。\n\n香港投資收入去年達到2,640億，為投資基金創下新高，高出2007年（1,422億）的次高紀錄1,218億。\n\n香港金融管理局的總資產，年底達 HK$40,153 億。根據長期投資計劃 (LTGP) 的投資總值為 HK$2,356 億，其中私募股權總值為 HK$1,572 億，而房地產則為 HK$784 億。未償投資承諾總值為 HK$162.4 億。\n\n聯匯基金（不包括策略投資組合）2017年的投資回報為7.4%。 具體而言，知識產權基金錄得12.1%的回報率，而商業發展基金錄得1.8%。長期增長基金自2009年成立以來，錄得年化的內部回報率為13.7%。\n\n聯邦投資公司的年度回報，自1994年到2017年，如圖1所示。表2顯示了2017年的投資回報以及基金在多個不同年期內的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為2.9%，過去五年的平均回報為2.5%，過去十年的平均回報為2.2%，自1994年以來的平均回報為4.9%。表3顯示了截至2017年12月31日，基金資產的貨幣構成。\n\n香港金管局副執行總裁

A total of 8,752 enquiries were handled in 2017, about half of which were related to banking policies and regulations, monetary and economic issues, consumer banking issues as well as notes and coins. Notable examples included the Coin Collection Programme, banking products and services, bankingrelated guidelines and circulars, monetary and economic statistics, prudential measures for property mortgage loans, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2014 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown in terms of the nature of enquiries received in 2017.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\nChart 2 Nature of enquiries received in 2017\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, in 2017 the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report and four issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKMA issued a total of 23 inSight articles, covering various topical issues related to its work.\n\n# HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 60,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the register of authorized institutions (AIs) and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance, as well as the register of stored value facility (SVF) licensees under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance. Dedicated webpages and eye-catching short-cut links are designed to draw public attention to the new initiatives of the HKMA, such as account opening, the regulatory regime for SVFs, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office and the Fintech Facilitation Office, as well as important and timely information, such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus telephone calls and the location of Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme.\n\n# Public Education Programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. It consists of an exhibition area and a library, and is open to the public six days a week. The exhibition area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It also contains reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nThe new look of the policy section of the Information Centre, which introduces the work of the HKMA and related financial concepts, was re-opened to the public on 24 February 2017 upon completion of the refurbishment work. The revamped policy section contains various interactive games and devices that integrate play into learning and explain complicated financial concepts in a simple way. Feedback from the visitors has been positive.\n\nStudents try out the educational games at the policy section of the Information Centre to learn about the work of the HKMA.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, it received more than 59,000 visitors and hosted over 650 guided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). More than 645,000 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe library, situated next to the exhibition area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the study of Hong Kong’s monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains the register of AIs and local representative offices and the register of securities staff of AIs, as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nThe library in the HKMA Information Centre.\n\nTo reach out to the community and raise public awareness of the HKMA’s work, the HKMA organised four public education seminars for about 2,000 secondary school students and teachers in 2017. Topics covered in the seminars included the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong banknotes, banking stability, consumer protection, the Deposit Protection Scheme, fintech, the Belt and Road Initiative and careers in the financial industry. More than 58,400 people have participated in this public education programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nStudents and teachers from secondary schools in different districts participate in one of the public education seminars.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre in 2017\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it employs staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and, where possible, to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increasing workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nThe Resolution Office was established on 1 April 2017 to implement the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance enacted in June 2016. The Office aims to ensure that the Hong Kong resolution regime is operational for banks. This is essential to enhancing the resilience of the Hong Kong banking sector in the event of any crisis.\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2017 was 927. This will be increased by 35 to 962 in 2018 (an increase of 3.8%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with the new initiatives and the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\n- Enhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n    – enhancing capacity to support the launch of the Faster Payment System and easy banking initiatives;\n    – strengthening supervisory capacity to deal with the regional and business expansion of banks and to facilitate (i) the wider adoption of fintech in the provision of banking services and (ii) collaboration with other regulatory authorities on cyber security and fintech issues; and\n    – supporting the work of the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to fight against fraud, money laundering and other types of financial crimes, and strengthening legal support for enforcement actions under legislation governing anti-money laundering and SVFs.\n- Strengthening investment, risk management and other related support for the further expansion and diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment activities.\n- Stepping up global macro and financial-sector surveillance, and strengthening talent development programmes to ensure that the HKMA has the necessary human capital to meet the long-term development needs of the organisation.\n\nTable 1 gives a breakdown of the establishment and strength of the HKMA.\n\nTable 1 Establishment and strength of the HKMA on 1 January 2018\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA also transfers staff members on secondment to other international or local organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council, to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year, depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through the EFAC, taking into account the GSC’s assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the paysurvey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants, and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff members to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay and any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff members based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the link between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director and above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments and awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n\n# Remuneration of senior staff members\n\nThe remuneration packages of senior staff members in 2017 are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Remuneration packages of HKMA senior staff members in 2017\n\n# Manager Trainee (MT) and Graduate Economist (GE) programmes\n\nTo develop a pool of young talent with sharp analytical minds, strong communication skills and good team spirit for a long-term career in central banking, the HKMA runs two trainee programmes: the MT programme and the GE programme. Each programme lasts for a period of two years.\n\nThe MT programme prepares young graduates interested in central banking work to become the HKMA’s future key management staff and contribute to the financial stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Each MT undergoes on-the-job training in two to three departments to acquire hands-on experience on the important functions of the HKMA. For the GE programme, young graduates interested in economic research are offered the opportunity to harness their research skills in two to three departments to provide important input to the policy formulation process.\n\nBoth the MT and GE programmes provide an all-rounded career development environment for the trainees. Apart from on-the-job training, the MTs and GEs also attend structured foundation central banking courses organised internally and by leading international or regional organisations. Upon successful completion of the respective programme, MTs are offered appointments as Managers and GEs as Economists to continue their pursuit of a professional career in the

雖然金管局是政府的重要部分，但它以與公務員不同以...計聘用員工，以吸引擁有相關經驗和專業知識的人才。 作為一個公共機構，金管局旨在保持精簡且靈活的架構，並在可能的情況下，重新部署員工資源以推行新的舉措，應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變動\n\n解決方案辦公室於2017年4月設立，以落實於2016年6月通過的金融機構（解決方案）條例。 辦公室旨在保證香港的解決方案機制可有效運作，以應對任何事件，加強香港銀行業的韌性。\n\n# 人員配置\n\n香港金管局於2017年設立的職能為927。這將於2018年上升至962（上升3.8%），以保證足夠的資源提供，應付新的倡議以及現有工作的繁重和數量增加。新的職位將採用於下列職能：\n\n加強銀行和金融穩定，包括：\n– 加強支持推出加快支付系統及簡易銀行服務倡議的能力；\n– 加強監管能力，應對銀行在區域和業務上的擴張，以及促進（i）在銀行服務的規定中更廣泛地採用金融科技，及（ii）與其他監管機構在網絡安全和金融科技問題上的合作；及\n– 支持欺詐及洗錢情報工作小組的工作，以打擊欺詐、洗錢及其他類別的金融犯罪，並加強法規執行行動在反洗錢及虛擬資產基金相關立法下的法律支持。\n加強投資、風險管理及其他相關的支持，以促進投資基金的進一步擴張和多元化。\n加強對全球宏觀及金融部門的監察，並加強人才發展計劃，以保證香港金管局擁有必要的資源，以應對機構的長期所需。\n\n表一列出了香港金管局的設立和強大情況。\n\n表1 2018年1月香港金管局的設立與強大。\n\n臨時資源被採用以應對其他工作需求。金管局亦會將職員調派至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展局，以協助在香港或金管局有利益的活動或政策倡議。部分職員以十足時間或兼職形式被採用，向香港存款保障基金委員會及期貨公眾市場協會提供營運支持。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪資審核機制\n\n金融司長（FS）會根據聯繫基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）及監管委員會（GSC）的意見，決定香港金管局員工的薪酬和服務狀況，並參考現時市場的水平和慣例。薪酬包括一筆總現金福利及公積金計劃，基本利益較少。這筆現金福利由每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）和浮動薪酬組成，可根據個人表現，每年以一次性給付形式頒發給個別成員，視乎表現而定。\n\n金管局人員薪酬每年由財政司司長在情況下檢討，並參考根據外部審核委員會（EFAC）向其提出的顧範局薪酬顧問委員會（GSC）的建議，同時考慮GSC對金管局過去年工作表現的評估、獨立人力資源顧問公司對金融界進行的薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他有關因素。為保持人員薪酬競爭力，或會不時就個別工作表現優秀的成員調整薪酬。\n\n任何批准的固定薪酬年度調整以及香港金管局的浮動薪酬發放，均根據個人表現向個別成員發放。香港金管局的投資專業人員受到浮動薪酬制度的影響，旨在鞏固其投資表現與薪酬發放之間的聯繫。在執行董事及以上職級的個別成員的薪酬調整與發放，現時由金融管理局根據GSC的意見批准。相關成員在討論其薪酬的會議上並不在場。部門主管及以下職級的個別成員的薪酬調整與發放，由香港金管局行政總裁在金融管理局授權下，並在批准的整體薪酬發放範圍內定出。\n\n#

{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Independent Auditor’s Report To the Financial Secretary\n\n# Opinion\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) set out on pages 157 to 243, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).\n\n# Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards.  My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Group in accordance with those standards, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n# Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.  These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n# Other information\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises all the information included in the 2017 Annual Report of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, other than the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.\n\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.  I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n# Responsibilities of the Monetary Authority and the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Monetary Authority is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\n\n# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Audit Commission auditing standards, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  I also:\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Monetary Authority;\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the Monetary Authority’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion.  My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements.  I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Sub-Committee of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nDavid Sun\nDirector of Audit\n\n11 April 2018\n\n# 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Monetary Authority, under delegated authority from the Financial Secretary as Controller of the Exchange Fund (the Fund), manages the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66).  The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portfolio.  The assets of the Backing Portfolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong’s Currency Board system.  The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments.  The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 30.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.  A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period.  Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures.  The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n- trading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\n- financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2);\n- available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\n- gold (note 2.11); and\n- investment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties.  Note 36 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments.  Apart from the accounting judgements involving these fair value estimations, there are no other critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are

匯生基金\n\n# 審計處長報告\n\n# 獨立審計師報告 財政司長先生\n\n# 意見\n\n本人謹此證明，我已審核了聯匯基金及其附屬機構（「本集團」）於157至243頁列出的財務報表，當中包括了截至2017年12月31日聯匯基金及本集團的資產負債表，以及該年終結的收入及支出賬戶、全面收益表、權益變動表、現金流量表，以及財務報表附註，包括顯著會計政策概要。\n\n在我意見中，財務報表妥為呈現了基金及其截至2017年12月31日 的財務地位，以及該年終結時的財務表現和現金流量，並按照香港會計師公會（“HKICPA”）發行 的香港財務報告準則 (“HKFRSs”) 規定取得，且已按照行政長官根據《交換基金條例》(第66章)第7條發出的指示妥為擬備。\n\n# 意見的依據\n\n我按照最高行政長官根據《流通資金條例》第七條發出的指示，進行了我的審計，並遵循審計委員會的審計準則。我根據這些準則所承擔的責任，在我的報告中「審計師對審計財務報表的責任」一節中進一步闡述。我對該集團保持獨立的地位，並按照這些準則履行了我其他的道德責任。我相信我所取得的審計證據足夠且適當，可以作為我意見的依據。\n\n# 審核重點\n\n關鍵審核事項是指，在我專業判斷下，於2017年12月31日止年度，我對財務報表審核中最重要的重要性事項。 這些事項是在我對整體財務報表進行審核的背景下，以及在形成我對其意見的過程中處理的，我並未就這些事項提供獨立的意見。\n\n# 其他資訊\n\n貨幣審定專員會肩負其他資訊的責任。該等其他資訊包括了香港貨幣審定專員會二零一七年年報內的所有資訊，但除財務報表及我對該等財務報表進行審核的報告外。\n\n我對財務報表的意見並不涵蓋其他資訊，且我對此類資訊不表達任何形式的保證結論。\n\n就我對財務報表的審計而言，我的責任是閱讀其他資訊，並在閱讀過程中，考慮其他資訊是否與財務報表或我在審計中獲得的知識存在重大不符，或否則顯著失實。 根據我所表現的工作，如果我認為該其他資訊存在重大失誤，我規定需要報告該事實。 在此方面，我沒有任何需要報告的。\n\n# 金融管理局及聯繫基金諮詢委員會審核委員會對財務報表的責任。\n\n貨幣審查局肩負著編製財務報表的責任，這些財務報表需按照香港財務匯報準則（HKFRSs）以及香港會計師公會發行的指引，以及行政長官根據《流通資金條例》第7節發出的指示編製，並需建立貨幣審查局認為為確保財務報表免受欺詐或錯誤導致的重大錯誤而必要的內部控制。\n\n在編製財務報表時，貨幣局肩負評估集團作為持續經營企業的能力，並如適用，披露與持續經營相關的事項，使用持續經營會計基礎。\n\n聯匯基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會肩負著監察集團財務報告流程的責任。\n\n# 審計師對審計財務報表的責任。\n\n我的目標是取得關於整體財務報表是否免於重大錯報的合理保證，無論是因欺詐或錯誤引起，並發行一份包含我的意見的審計報告。合理保證是一新高的保證程度，但並非保證在按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計中，一向能夠發現已存在的重大錯報。錯報可能源於欺詐或錯誤，並且如果個別或整體來看，合理地預期會影響基於這些財務報表的用戶所做的經濟決定，則被考慮為重大。\n\n作為一份按照審計委員會審計標準進行的審計的一部分，我運用專業判斷，並在整個審計過程中保持專業懷疑。我亦：\n- 識別及評估財務報表存在重大錯誤陳述的風險，無論是因欺詐或錯誤而導致，設計並發揮響應這些風險的審計程序，並取得足夠且適當的審計證據，以作為我意見的依據。因欺詐而未發現重大錯誤的風險，高於因錯誤而未發現的風險，因為欺詐可能涉及勾結、偽造、故意遺漏、虛假陳述或凌駕於內部控制之上；\n- 了解與審計有關的內部控制，以便設計在相關情況下適當的審計程序，但並非為了表達對集團內部控制有效性的意見；\n- 評估貨幣局所使用的會計政策的適當性，以及貨幣局所做的會計估計及其相關披露的合理性；\n- 得出貨幣局使用持續經營會計基礎的適當性結論，並根據取得的審計證據，判斷是否存在與可能對集團持續經營能力產生顯著質疑的事件或狀況相關的不確定性。如果我得出存在重大不確定性的結論，我規定需要在我的審計報告中對財務報表中的相關披露事項加以提示，或者如果這些披露事項不足，則修改我的意見。我的結論是根據在我的審計報告日期之前取得的審計證據作出的。然而，未來的事件或狀況可能導致集團無法繼續作為持續經營。\n- 評估財務報表的整體呈報、結構和內容，包括披露事項，以及財務報表是否以一種達到公允呈報的方式反映了基礎交易和事件；以及\n- 取得關於集團內實體或業務活動的財務信息足夠且適當的審計證據，以便對財務報表發表意見。我肩負了對集團審計的指導、監督和發揮的責任。我單憑自身對審計意見負有責任。\n\n我與聯匯基金諮詢委員會的委員會溝通，在…方面，包括審計範圍和時間安排，以及顯著的審計結果，包括我在審計過程中識別到的任何顯著內部監控不足。\n\n我亦向投資基金審查委員會的委員會提供聲明，確認我已遵守有關獨立性的道德要求，並與該委員會溝通所有可能影響我獨立性的關係及其他事項，以及在適用情況下，相關的保障。\n\n從與聯匯基金諮詢委員會的審計委員會溝通的事項中，我釐定在審計財務報表現時期內最重要的重要性，因此成為關鍵審計事項。除非法律或法規禁止公開披露該事項，或在極為罕見的情況下，我會認為將事項在報告中溝通會合理預期會產生不利後果，而這些後果會超過公開溝通所帶來的公共利益，否則我會描述這些事項於我的審計報告中。\n\n孫大衛\n審計主管\n\n4月2018年\n\n# 主要活動\n\n貨幣局獲財政司長授權，作為外匯基金（該基金）監管人，按照《外匯基金條例》（第66章）的條文，管理該基金。該基金的主要職責是維護香港的貨幣價值，以及維持香港貨幣及金融系統的穩定和健全。\n\n基金的資產由四個投資組合管理：支持投資組合、投資組合、長期增長投資組合和策略投資組合。支持投資組合的資產完全符合香港貨幣發行制度下的貨幣基礎。投資組合主要投資於經濟合作與發展組織成員國的債券和股票市場。長期增長投資組合持有私募股權和房地產投資。策略投資組合持有香港交易所及結算有限公司的股份，該股份是香港特別行政區政府為基金的策略目的購入的。運作範疇的資料載於第30條附註。\n\n# 2 顯著會計政策\n\n# 2.1% 聲明\n\n這些財務報表已按照所有適用於香港的香港財務報告準則 (HKFRSs) 編製，而香港財務報告準則是一個集體名詞，包括所有適用的個別香港財務報告準則、香港會計準則 (HKASs) 以及香港執業會計師公會 (HKICPA) 發行的一切詮釋，以及香港一般公認的會計原則。基金及其附屬公司 (以下統稱為集團) 採納的顯著會計政策摘要如下。\n\n香港會計師公會已發行特定的新股及修訂香港財務報告準則，首期生效或現時可供早期採用。附注3提供有關因新股採用這些發展而導致的會計政策變動（如有），且與本集團就本期及之前期內所反映的會計期有關的資料。\n\n# 2.2% 財務報表的編製基礎\n\n集團財務報表包括集團的財務報表，以及集團在聯營公司和合資企業中的權益。主要子公司、聯營公司和合資企業的主要活動所載於附註16和17。\n\n財務報表的編製採用歷史成本作為計量基礎，除……外，以下資產及負債按其公允價值列示，具體說明請參閱以下會計政策：\n- 交易性金融工具（註 2.6.2.1）；\n- 指定為按公允價值計量的金融資產及金融負債（註 2.6.2.2）；\n- 可供銷售的證券（註 2.6.2.5）；\n- 黃金（註 2.11）；及\n- 投資房地產（註 2.12）。\n\n根據香港財務報告準則編製財務報表，需要管理層作出判斷、估計及假設，這些會影響政策的應用以及報告的數額。這些估計及相關假設是根據經驗和多個其他因素而定，這些因素被認為在當時情況下是合理的，其結果構成了判斷資產及負債帳面價值（這些價值並非來自資料來源的其他資訊）的依據。實際結果可能與這些估計不同。\n\n估計及相關假設會持續地進行檢討。若修訂的會計估計僅影響當期，則會在估計被修訂的期內認可；若修訂影響當期及未來期，則會在修訂的期及未來期內認可。\n\n編注18包含關於投資物業公允價值估計的相關假設。編注36包含關於金融工具公允價值估計的相關假設。除與這些公允價值估計相關的會計判斷外，在應用集團的會計政策方面，沒有其他重要的會計判斷。\n\n# 2.3% 附屬公司及少數股東權益\n\n子公司是由集團控制的實體。集團控制一家實體，當它暴露於該實體相關的浮動回報，或擁有從與該實體參與中獲得回報的權利，並且透過其對該實體的實力來影響這些回報。在評估集團是否擁有實力時，僅考慮集團及其他方所持有的實質性權利。\n"}
